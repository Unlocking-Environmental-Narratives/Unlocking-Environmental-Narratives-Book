# Unlocking Environmental Narratives - Chapter 5

The code and experiments run for the analysis of glacier texts for this chapter can be found in the IPython notebook file: `TextBerg_glacier.ipynb`. The notebook includes instructions for downloading the TextBerg corpus, and you will need to update the `input_path` in Section 1.1 to point to the location on your local computer.
