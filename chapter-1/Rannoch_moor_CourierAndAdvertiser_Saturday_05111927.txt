THE GLENCOE ROAD
There are signs that the Ministry of Transport is in for a hot time when Parliament meets over its plans for constructing a great motor highway through the Moor of Rannoch and Glencoe.
There is, so far, complete unanimity among those who have written and spoken on the subject that the plan is in outrage on sentiment and good taste. It will ruin the scenery and character of a route which is hardly ever traversed save for the sake of its scenery and character.
But the case against the Ministry's plans on the ground of common sense is at least equally strong.
Sir John Stirling Maxwell, who probably knows the West Highlands as well as anybody in Scotland, declares in a letter to the "Times" that the present road could have been made good for the traffic that uses it for the sum spent by the Ministry in surveying and designing the new road.
That on such a road the Ministry should propose to spend half a million at the time when it has in effect stopped the work on the three-quarters completed West Highland road from Glasgow to Inverness because of shortage of funds in the crowning wonder.
A feeling is taking hold that the Ministry is not to be trusted where, as is frequently the case in roadmaking, good taste is involved. It has irretrievably ruined the beauty of many parts of the Great North road, and its concrete bridges are everywhere blots on the landscape and eyesores.
