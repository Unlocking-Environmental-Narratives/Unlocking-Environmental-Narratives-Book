<h1>A JOURNEY TO THE WESTERN ISLANDS OF SCOTLAND</h1>
<h2>INCH KEITH</h2>
<p>I had desired to visit the Hebrides, or Western Islands of Scotland,
so long, that I scarcely remember how the wish was originally excited;
and was in the Autumn of the year 1773 induced to undertake the journey,
by finding in Mr. Boswell a companion, whose acuteness would help my
inquiry, and whose gaiety of conversation and civility of manners are
sufficient to counteract the inconveniences of travel, in countries
less hospitable than we have passed.</p>
<p>On the eighteenth of August we left Edinburgh, a city too well known
to admit description, and directed our course northward, along the eastern
coast of Scotland, accompanied the first day by another gentleman, who
could stay with us only long enough to shew us how much we lost at separation.</p>
<p>As we crossed the Frith of Forth, our curiosity was attracted by
Inch Keith, a small island, which neither of my companions had ever
visited, though, lying within their view, it had all their lives solicited
their notice.&nbsp; Here, by climbing with some difficulty over shattered
crags, we made the first experiment of unfrequented coasts.&nbsp; Inch
Keith is nothing more than a rock covered with a thin layer of earth,
not wholly bare of grass, and very fertile of thistles.&nbsp; A small
herd of cows grazes annually upon it in the summer.&nbsp; It seems never
to have afforded to man or beast a permanent habitation.</p>
<p>We found only the ruins of a small fort, not so injured by time but
that it might be easily restored to its former state.&nbsp; It seems
never to have been intended as a place of strength, nor was built to
endure a siege, but merely to afford cover to a few soldiers, who perhaps
had the charge of a battery, or were stationed to give signals of approaching
danger.&nbsp; There is therefore no provision of water within the walls,
though the spring is so near, that it might have been easily enclosed.&nbsp;
One of the stones had this inscription: &lsquo;Maria Reg. 1564.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It has probably been neglected from the time that the whole island had
the same king.</p>
<p>We left this little island with our thoughts employed awhile on the
different appearance that it would have made, if it had been placed
at the same distance from London, with the same facility of approach;
with what emulation of price a few rocky acres would have been purchased,
and with what expensive industry they would have been cultivated and
adorned.</p>
<p>When we landed, we found our chaise ready, and passed through Kinghorn,
Kirkaldy, and Cowpar, places not unlike the small or straggling market-towns
in those parts of England where commerce and manufactures have not yet
produced opulence.</p>
<p>Though we were yet in the most populous part of Scotland, and at
so small a distance from the capital, we met few passengers.</p>
<p>The roads are neither rough nor dirty; and it affords a southern
stranger a new kind of pleasure to travel so commodiously without the
interruption of toll-gates.&nbsp; Where the bottom is rocky, as it seems
commonly to be in Scotland, a smooth way is made indeed with great labour,
but it never wants repairs; and in those parts where adventitious materials
are necessary, the ground once consolidated is rarely broken; for the
inland commerce is not great, nor are heavy commodities often transported
otherwise than by water.&nbsp; The carriages in common use are small
carts, drawn each by one little horse; and a man seems to derive some
degree of dignity and importance from the reputation of possessing a
two-horse cart.</p>
<h2>ST. ANDREWS</h2>
<p>At an hour somewhat late we came to St. Andrews, a city once archiepiscopal;
where that university still subsists in which philosophy was formerly
taught by Buchanan, whose name has as fair a claim to immortality as
can be conferred by modern latinity, and perhaps a fairer than the instability
of vernacular languages admits.</p>
<p>We found, that by the interposition of some invisible friend, lodgings
had been provided for us at the house of one of the professors, whose
easy civility quickly made us forget that we were strangers; and in
the whole time of our stay we were gratified by every mode of kindness,
and entertained with all the elegance of lettered hospitality.</p>
<p>In the morning we rose to perambulate a city, which only history
shews to have once flourished, and surveyed the ruins of ancient magnificence,
of which even the ruins cannot long be visible, unless some care be
taken to preserve them; and where is the pleasure of preserving such
mournful memorials?&nbsp; They have been till very lately so much neglected,
that every man carried away the stones who fancied that he wanted them.</p>
<p>The cathedral, of which the foundations may be still traced, and
a small part of the wall is standing, appears to have been a spacious
and majestick building, not unsuitable to the primacy of the kingdom.&nbsp;
Of the architecture, the poor remains can hardly exhibit, even to an
artist, a sufficient specimen.&nbsp; It was demolished, as is well known,
in the tumult and violence of Knox&rsquo;s reformation.</p>
<p>Not far from the cathedral, on the margin of the water, stands a
fragment of the castle, in which the archbishop anciently resided.&nbsp;
It was never very large, and was built with more attention to security
than pleasure.&nbsp; Cardinal Beatoun is said to have had workmen employed
in improving its fortifications at the time when he was murdered by
the ruffians of reformation, in the manner of which Knox has given what
he himself calls a merry narrative.</p>
<p>The change of religion in Scotland, eager and vehement as it was,
raised an epidemical enthusiasm, compounded of sullen scrupulousness
and warlike ferocity, which, in a people whom idleness resigned to their
own thoughts, and who, conversing only with each other, suffered no
dilution of their zeal from the gradual influx of new opinions, was
long transmitted in its full strength from the old to the young, but
by trade and intercourse with England, is now visibly abating, and giving
way too fast to that laxity of practice and indifference of opinion,
in which men, not sufficiently instructed to find the middle point,
too easily shelter themselves from rigour and constraint.</p>
<p>The city of St. Andrews, when it had lost its archiepiscopal pre-eminence,
gradually decayed: One of its streets is now lost; and in those that
remain, there is silence and solitude of inactive indigence and gloomy
depopulation.</p>
<p>The university, within a few years, consisted of three colleges,
but is now reduced to two; the college of St. Leonard being lately dissolved
by the sale of its buildings and the appropriation of its revenues to
the professors of the two others.&nbsp; The chapel of the alienated
college is yet standing, a fabrick not inelegant of external structure;
but I was always, by some civil excuse, hindred from entering it.&nbsp;
A decent attempt, as I was since told, has been made to convert it into
a kind of green-house, by planting its area with shrubs.&nbsp; This
new method of gardening is unsuccessful; the plants do not hitherto
prosper.&nbsp; To what use it will next be put I have no pleasure in
conjecturing.&nbsp; It is something that its present state is at least
not ostentatiously displayed.&nbsp; Where there is yet shame, there
may in time be virtue.</p>
<p>The dissolution of St. Leonard&rsquo;s college was doubtless necessary;
but of that necessity there is reason to complain.&nbsp; It is surely
not without just reproach, that a nation, of which the commerce is hourly
extending, and the wealth encreasing, denies any participation of its
prosperity to its literary societies; and while its merchants or its
nobles are raising palaces, suffers its universities to moulder into
dust.</p>
<p>Of the two colleges yet standing, one is by the institution of its
founder appropriated to Divinity.&nbsp; It is said to be capable of
containing fifty students; but more than one must occupy a chamber.&nbsp;
The library, which is of late erection, is not very spacious, but elegant
and luminous.</p>
<p>The doctor, by whom it was shewn, hoped to irritate or subdue my
English vanity by telling me, that we had no such repository of books
in England.</p>
<p>Saint Andrews seems to be a place eminently adapted to study and
education, being situated in a populous, yet a cheap country, and exposing
the minds and manners of young men neither to the levity and dissoluteness
of a capital city, nor to the gross luxury of a town of commerce, places
naturally unpropitious to learning; in one the desire of knowledge easily
gives way to the love of pleasure, and in the other, is in danger of
yielding to the love of money.</p>
<p>The students however are represented as at this time not exceeding
a hundred.&nbsp; Perhaps it may be some obstruction to their increase
that there is no episcopal chapel in the place.&nbsp; I saw no reason
for imputing their paucity to the present professors; nor can the expence
of an academical education be very reasonably objected.&nbsp; A student
of the highest class may keep his annual session, or as the English
call it, his term, which lasts seven months, for about fifteen pounds,
and one of lower rank for less than ten; in which board, lodging, and
instruction are all included.</p>
<p>The chief magistrate resident in the university, answering to our
vice-chancellor, and to the <i>rector magnificus</i> on the continent,
had commonly the title of Lord Rector; but being addressed only as Mr.
Rector in an inauguratory speech by the present chancellor, he has fallen
from his former dignity of style.&nbsp; Lordship was very liberally
annexed by our ancestors to any station or character of dignity: They
said, the Lord General, and Lord Ambassador; so we still say, my Lord,
to the judge upon the circuit, and yet retain in our Liturgy the Lords
of the Council.</p>
<p>In walking among the ruins of religious buildings, we came to two
vaults over which had formerly stood the house of the sub-prior.&nbsp;
One of the vaults was inhabited by an old woman, who claimed the right
of abode there, as the widow of a man whose ancestors had possessed
the same gloomy mansion for no less than four generations.&nbsp; The
right, however it began, was considered as established by legal prescription,
and the old woman lives undisturbed.&nbsp; She thinks however that she
has a claim to something more than sufferance; for as her husband&rsquo;s
name was Bruce, she is allied to royalty, and told Mr. Boswell that
when there were persons of quality in the place, she was distinguished
by some notice; that indeed she is now neglected, but she spins a thread,
has the company of her cat, and is troublesome to nobody.</p>
<p>Having now seen whatever this ancient city offered to our curiosity,
we left it with good wishes, having reason to be highly pleased with
the attention that was paid us.&nbsp; But whoever surveys the world
must see many things that give him pain.&nbsp; The kindness of the professors
did not contribute to abate the uneasy remembrance of an university
declining, a college alienated, and a church profaned and hastening
to the ground.</p>
<p>St. Andrews indeed has formerly suffered more atrocious ravages and
more extensive destruction, but recent evils affect with greater force.&nbsp;
We were reconciled to the sight of archiepiscopal ruins.&nbsp; The distance
of a calamity from the present time seems to preclude the mind from
contact or sympathy.&nbsp; Events long past are barely known; they are
not considered.&nbsp; We read with as little emotion the violence of
Knox and his followers, as the irruptions of Alaric and the Goths.&nbsp;
Had the university been destroyed two centuries ago, we should not have
regretted it; but to see it pining in decay and struggling for life,
fills the mind with mournful images and ineffectual wishes.</p>
<h2>ABERBROTHICK</h2>
<p>As we knew sorrow and wishes to be vain, it was now our business
to mind our way.&nbsp; The roads of Scotland afford little diversion
to the traveller, who seldom sees himself either encountered or overtaken,
and who has nothing to contemplate but grounds that have no visible
boundaries, or are separated by walls of loose stone.&nbsp; From the
bank of the Tweed to St. Andrews I had never seen a single tree, which
I did not believe to have grown up far within the present century.&nbsp;
Now and then about a gentleman&rsquo;s house stands a small plantation,
which in Scotch is called a policy, but of these there are few, and
those few all very young.&nbsp; The variety of sun and shade is here
utterly unknown.&nbsp; There is no tree for either shelter or timber.&nbsp;
The oak and the thorn is equally a stranger, and the whole country is
extended in uniform nakedness, except that in the road between Kirkaldy
and Cowpar, I passed for a few yards between two hedges.&nbsp; A tree
might be a show in Scotland as a horse in Venice.&nbsp; At St. Andrews
Mr. Boswell found only one, and recommended it to my notice; I told
him that it was rough and low, or looked as if I thought so.&nbsp; This,
said he, is nothing to another a few miles off.&nbsp; I was still less
delighted to hear that another tree was not to be seen nearer.&nbsp;
Nay, said a gentleman that stood by, I know but of this and that tree
in the county.</p>
<p>The Lowlands of Scotland had once undoubtedly an equal portion of
woods with other countries.&nbsp; Forests are every where gradually
diminished, as architecture and cultivation prevail by the increase
of people and the introduction of arts.&nbsp; But I believe few regions
have been denuded like this, where many centuries must have passed in
waste without the least thought of future supply.&nbsp; Davies observes
in his account of Ireland, that no Irishman had ever planted an orchard.&nbsp;
For that negligence some excuse might be drawn from an unsettled state
of life, and the instability of property; but in Scotland possession
has long been secure, and inheritance regular, yet it may be doubted
whether before the Union any man between Edinburgh and England had ever
set a tree.</p>
<p>Of this improvidence no other account can be given than that it probably
began in times of tumult, and continued because it had begun.&nbsp;
Established custom is not easily broken, till some great event shakes
the whole system of things, and life seems to recommence upon new principles.&nbsp;
That before the Union the Scots had little trade and little money, is
no valid apology; for plantation is the least expensive of all methods
of improvement.&nbsp; To drop a seed into the ground can cost nothing,
and the trouble is not great of protecting the young plant, till it
is out of danger; though it must be allowed to have some difficulty
in places like these, where they have neither wood for palisades, nor
thorns for hedges.</p>
<p>Our way was over the Firth of Tay, where, though the water was not
wide, we paid four shillings for ferrying the chaise.&nbsp; In Scotland
the necessaries of life are easily procured, but superfluities and elegancies
are of the same price at least as in England, and therefore may be considered
as much dearer.</p>
<p>We stopped a while at Dundee, where I remember nothing remarkable,
and mounting our chaise again, came about the close of the day to Aberbrothick.</p>
<p>The monastery of Aberbrothick is of great renown in the history of
Scotland.&nbsp; Its ruins afford ample testimony of its ancient magnificence:
Its extent might, I suppose, easily be found by following the walls
among the grass and weeds, and its height is known by some parts yet
standing.&nbsp; The arch of one of the gates is entire, and of another
only so far dilapidated as to diversify the appearance.&nbsp; A square
apartment of great loftiness is yet standing; its use I could not conjecture,
as its elevation was very disproportionate to its area.&nbsp; Two corner
towers, particularly attracted our attention.&nbsp; Mr. Boswell, whose
inquisitiveness is seconded by great activity, scrambled in at a high
window, but found the stairs within broken, and could not reach the
top.&nbsp; Of the other tower we were told that the inhabitants sometimes
climbed it, but we did not immediately discern the entrance, and as
the night was gathering upon us, thought proper to desist.&nbsp; Men
skilled in architecture might do what we did not attempt: They might
probably form an exact ground-plot of this venerable edifice.&nbsp;
They may from some parts yet standing conjecture its general form, and
perhaps by comparing it with other buildings of the same kind and the
same age, attain an idea very near to truth.&nbsp; I should scarcely
have regretted my journey, had it afforded nothing more than the sight
of Aberbrothick.</p>
<h2>MONTROSE</h2>
<p>Leaving these fragments of magnificence, we travelled on to Montrose,
which we surveyed in the morning, and found it well built, airy, and
clean.&nbsp; The townhouse is a handsome fabrick with a portico.&nbsp;
We then went to view the English chapel, and found a small church, clean
to a degree unknown in any other part of Scotland, with commodious galleries,
and what was yet less expected, with an organ.</p>
<p>At our inn we did not find a reception such as we thought proportionate
to the commercial opulence of the place; but Mr. Boswell desired me
to observe that the innkeeper was an Englishman, and I then defended
him as well as I could.</p>
<p>When I had proceeded thus far, I had opportunities of observing what
I had never heard, that there are many beggars in Scotland.&nbsp; In
Edinburgh the proportion is, I think, not less than in London, and in
the smaller places it is far greater than in English towns of the same
extent.&nbsp; It must, however, be allowed that they are not importunate,
nor clamorous.&nbsp; They solicit silently, or very modestly, and therefore
though their behaviour may strike with more force the heart of a stranger,
they are certainly in danger of missing the attention of their countrymen.&nbsp;
Novelty has always some power, an unaccustomed mode of begging excites
an unaccustomed degree of pity.&nbsp; But the force of novelty is by
its own nature soon at an end; the efficacy of outcry and perseverance
is permanent and certain.</p>
<p>The road from Montrose exhibited a continuation of the same appearances.&nbsp;
The country is still naked, the hedges are of stone, and the fields
so generally plowed that it is hard to imagine where grass is found
for the horses that till them.&nbsp; The harvest, which was almost ripe,
appeared very plentiful.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon Mr. Boswell observed that we were at no great
distance from the house of lord Monboddo.&nbsp; The magnetism of his
conversation easily drew us out of our way, and the entertainment which
we received would have been a sufficient recompense for a much greater
deviation.</p>
<p>The roads beyond Edinburgh, as they are less frequented, must be
expected to grow gradually rougher; but they were hitherto by no means
incommodious.&nbsp; We travelled on with the gentle pace of a Scotch
driver, who having no rivals in expedition, neither gives himself nor
his horses unnecessary trouble.&nbsp; We did not affect the impatience
we did not feel, but were satisfied with the company of each other as
well riding in the chaise, as sitting at an inn.&nbsp; The night and
the day are equally solitary and equally safe; for where there are so
few travellers, why should there be robbers.</p>
<h2>ABERDEEN</h2>
<p>We came somewhat late to Aberdeen, and found the inn so full, that
we had some difficulty in obtaining admission, till Mr. Boswell made
himself known: His name overpowered all objection, and we found a very
good house and civil treatment.</p>
<p>I received the next day a very kind letter from Sir Alexander Gordon,
whom I had formerly known in London, and after a cessation of all intercourse
for near twenty years met here professor of physic in the King&rsquo;s
College.&nbsp; Such unexpected renewals of acquaintance may be numbered
among the most pleasing incidents of life.</p>
<p>The knowledge of one professor soon procured me the notice of the
rest, and I did not want any token of regard, being conducted wherever
there was any thing which I desired to see, and entertained at once
with the novelty of the place, and the kindness of communication.</p>
<p>To write of the cities of our own island with the solemnity of geographical
description, as if we had been cast upon a newly discovered coast, has
the appearance of very frivolous ostentation; yet as Scotland is little
known to the greater part of those who may read these observations,
it is not superfluous to relate, that under the name of Aberdeen are
comprised two towns standing about a mile distant from each other, but
governed, I think, by the same magistrates.</p>
<p>Old Aberdeen is the ancient episcopal city, in which are still to
be seen the remains of the cathedral.&nbsp; It has the appearance of
a town in decay, having been situated in times when commerce was yet
unstudied, with very little attention to the commodities of the harbour.</p>
<p>New Aberdeen has all the bustle of prosperous trade, and all the
shew of increasing opulence.&nbsp; It is built by the water-side.&nbsp;
The houses are large and lofty, and the streets spacious and clean.&nbsp;
They build almost wholly with the granite used in the new pavement of
the streets of London, which is well known not to want hardness, yet
they shape it easily.&nbsp; It is beautiful and must be very lasting.</p>
<p>What particular parts of commerce are chiefly exercised by the merchants
of Aberdeen, I have not inquired.&nbsp; The manufacture which forces
itself upon a stranger&rsquo;s eye is that of knit-stockings, on which
the women of the lower class are visibly employed.</p>
<p>In each of these towns there is a college, or in stricter language,
an university; for in both there are professors of the same parts of
learning, and the colleges hold their sessions and confer degrees separately,
with total independence of one on the other.</p>
<p>In old Aberdeen stands the King&rsquo;s College, of which the first
president was Hector Boece, or Boethius, who may be justly reverenced
as one of the revivers of elegant learning.&nbsp; When he studied at
Paris, he was acquainted with Erasmus, who afterwards gave him a public
testimony of his esteem, by inscribing to him a catalogue of his works.&nbsp;
The stile of Boethius, though, perhaps, not always rigorously pure,
is formed with great diligence upon ancient models, and wholly uninfected
with monastic barbarity.&nbsp; His history is written with elegance
and vigour, but his fabulousness and credulity are justly blamed.&nbsp;
His fabulousness, if he was the author of the fictions, is a fault for
which no apology can be made; but his credulity may be excused in an
age, when all men were credulous.&nbsp; Learning was then rising on
the world; but ages so long accustomed to darkness, were too much dazzled
with its light to see any thing distinctly.&nbsp; The first race of
scholars, in the fifteenth century, and some time after, were, for the
most part, learning to speak, rather than to think, and were therefore
more studious of elegance than of truth.&nbsp; The contemporaries of
Boethius thought it sufficient to know what the ancients had delivered.&nbsp;
The examination of tenets and of facts was reserved for another generation.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Boethius, as president of the university, enjoyed a revenue of forty
Scottish marks, about two pounds four shillings and sixpence of sterling
money.&nbsp; In the present age of trade and taxes, it is difficult
even for the imagination so to raise the value of money, or so to diminish
the demands of life, as to suppose four and forty shillings a year,
an honourable stipend; yet it was probably equal, not only to the needs,
but to the rank of Boethius.&nbsp; The wealth of England was undoubtedly
to that of Scotland more than five to one, and it is known that Henry
the eighth, among whose faults avarice was never reckoned, granted to
Roger Ascham, as a reward of his learning, a pension of ten pounds a
year.</p>
<p>The other, called the Marischal College, is in the new town.&nbsp;
The hall is large and well lighted.&nbsp; One of its ornaments is the
picture of Arthur Johnston, who was principal of the college, and who
holds among the Latin poets of Scotland the next place to the elegant
Buchanan.</p>
<p>In the library I was shewn some curiosities; a Hebrew manuscript
of exquisite penmanship, and a Latin translation of Aristotle&rsquo;s
Politicks by Leonardus Aretinus, written in the Roman character with
nicety and beauty, which, as the art of printing has made them no longer
necessary, are not now to be found.&nbsp; This was one of the latest
performances of the transcribers, for Aretinus died but about twenty
years before typography was invented.&nbsp; This version has been printed,
and may be found in libraries, but is little read; for the same books
have been since translated both by Victorius and Lambinus, who lived
in an age more cultivated, but perhaps owed in part to Aretinus that
they were able to excel him.&nbsp; Much is due to those who first broke
the way to knowledge, and left only to their successors the task of
smoothing it.</p>
<p>In both these colleges the methods of instruction are nearly the
same; the lectures differing only by the accidental difference of diligence,
or ability in the professors.&nbsp; The students wear scarlet gowns
and the professors black, which is, I believe, the academical dress
in all the Scottish universities, except that of Edinburgh, where the
scholars are not distinguished by any particular habit.&nbsp; In the
King&rsquo;s College there is kept a public table, but the scholars
of the Marischal College are boarded in the town.&nbsp; The expence
of living is here, according to the information that I could obtain,
somewhat more than at St. Andrews.</p>
<p>The course of education is extended to four years, at the end of
which those who take a degree, who are not many, become masters of arts,
and whoever is a master may, if he pleases, immediately commence doctor.&nbsp;
The title of doctor, however, was for a considerable time bestowed only
on physicians.&nbsp; The advocates are examined and approved by their
own body; the ministers were not ambitious of titles, or were afraid
of being censured for ambition; and the doctorate in every faculty was
commonly given or sold into other countries.&nbsp; The ministers are
now reconciled to distinction, and as it must always happen that some
will excel others, have thought graduation a proper testimony of uncommon
abilities or acquisitions.</p>
<p>The indiscriminate collation of degrees has justly taken away that
respect which they originally claimed as stamps, by which the literary
value of men so distinguished was authoritatively denoted.&nbsp; That
academical honours, or any others should be conferred with exact proportion
to merit, is more than human judgment or human integrity have given
reason to expect.&nbsp; Perhaps degrees in universities cannot be better
adjusted by any general rule than by the length of time passed in the
public profession of learning.&nbsp; An English or Irish doctorate cannot
be obtained by a very young man, and it is reasonable to suppose, what
is likewise by experience commonly found true, that he who is by age
qualified to be a doctor, has in so much time gained learning sufficient
not to disgrace the title, or wit sufficient not to desire it.</p>
<p>The Scotch universities hold but one term or session in the year.&nbsp;
That of St. Andrews continues eight months, that of Aberdeen only five,
from the first of November to the first of April.</p>
<p>In Aberdeen there is an English Chapel, in which the congregation
was numerous and splendid.&nbsp; The form of public worship used by
the church of England is in Scotland legally practised in licensed chapels
served by clergymen of English or Irish ordination, and by tacit connivance
quietly permitted in separate congregations supplied with ministers
by the successors of the bishops who were deprived at the Revolution.</p>
<p>We came to Aberdeen on Saturday August 21.&nbsp; On Monday we were
invited into the town-hall, where I had the freedom of the city given
me by the Lord Provost.&nbsp; The honour conferred had all the decorations
that politeness could add, and what I am afraid I should not have had
to say of any city south of the Tweed, I found no petty officer bowing
for a fee.</p>
<p>The parchment containing the record of admission is, with the seal
appending, fastened to a riband and worn for one day by the new citizen
in his hat.</p>
<p>By a lady who saw us at the chapel, the Earl of Errol was informed
of our arrival, and we had the honour of an invitation to his seat,
called Slanes Castle, as I am told, improperly, from the castle of that
name, which once stood at a place not far distant.</p>
<p>The road beyond Aberdeen grew more stony, and continued equally naked
of all vegetable decoration.&nbsp; We travelled over a tract of ground
near the sea, which, not long ago, suffered a very uncommon, and unexpected
calamity.&nbsp; The sand of the shore was raised by a tempest in such
quantities, and carried to such a distance, that an estate was overwhelmed
and lost.&nbsp; Such and so hopeless was the barrenness superinduced,
that the owner, when he was required to pay the usual tax, desired rather
to resign the ground.</p>
<h2>SLANES CASTLE, THE BULLER OF BUCHAN</h2>
<p>We came in the afternoon to Slanes Castle, built upon the margin
of the sea, so that the walls of one of the towers seem only a continuation
of a perpendicular rock, the foot of which is beaten by the waves.&nbsp;
To walk round the house seemed impracticable.&nbsp; From the windows
the eye wanders over the sea that separates Scotland from Norway, and
when the winds beat with violence must enjoy all the terrifick grandeur
of the tempestuous ocean.&nbsp; I would not for my amusement wish for
a storm; but as storms, whether wished or not, will sometimes happen,
I may say, without violation of humanity, that I should willingly look
out upon them from Slanes Castle.</p>
<p>When we were about to take our leave, our departure was prohibited
by the countess till we should have seen two places upon the coast,
which she rightly considered as worthy of curiosity, Dun Buy, and the
Buller of Buchan, to which Mr. Boyd very kindly conducted us.</p>
<p>Dun Buy, which in Erse is said to signify the Yellow Rock, is a double
protuberance of stone, open to the main sea on one side, and parted
from the land by a very narrow channel on the other.&nbsp; It has its
name and its colour from the dung of innumerable sea-fowls, which in
the Spring chuse this place as convenient for incubation, and have their
eggs and their young taken in great abundance.&nbsp; One of the birds
that frequent this rock has, as we were told, its body not larger than
a duck&rsquo;s, and yet lays eggs as large as those of a goose.&nbsp;
This bird is by the inhabitants named a Coot.&nbsp; That which is called
Coot in England, is here a Cooter.</p>
<p>Upon these rocks there was nothing that could long detain attention,
and we soon turned our eyes to the Buller, or Bouilloir of Buchan, which
no man can see with indifference, who has either sense of danger or
delight in rarity.&nbsp; It is a rock perpendicularly tubulated, united
on one side with a high shore, and on the other rising steep to a great
height, above the main sea.&nbsp; The top is open, from which may be
seen a dark gulf of water which flows into the cavity, through a breach
made in the lower part of the inclosing rock.&nbsp; It has the appearance
of a vast well bordered with a wall.&nbsp; The edge of the Buller is
not wide, and to those that walk round, appears very narrow.&nbsp; He
that ventures to look downward sees, that if his foot should slip, he
must fall from his dreadful elevation upon stones on one side, or into
water on the other.&nbsp; We however went round, and were glad when
the circuit was completed.</p>
<p>When we came down to the sea, we saw some boats, and rowers, and
resolved to explore the Buller at the bottom.&nbsp; We entered the arch,
which the water had made, and found ourselves in a place, which, though
we could not think ourselves in danger, we could scarcely survey without
some recoil of the mind.&nbsp; The bason in which we floated was nearly
circular, perhaps thirty yards in diameter.&nbsp; We were inclosed by
a natural wall, rising steep on every side to a height which produced
the idea of insurmountable confinement.&nbsp; The interception of all
lateral light caused a dismal gloom.&nbsp; Round us was a perpendicular
rock, above us the distant sky, and below an unknown profundity of water.&nbsp;
If I had any malice against a walking spirit, instead of laying him
in the Red-sea, I would condemn him to reside in the Buller of Buchan.</p>
<p>But terrour without danger is only one of the sports of fancy, a
voluntary agitation of the mind that is permitted no longer than it
pleases.&nbsp; We were soon at leisure to examine the place with minute
inspection, and found many cavities which, as the waterman told us,
went backward to a depth which they had never explored.&nbsp; Their
extent we had not time to try; they are said to serve different purposes.&nbsp;
Ladies come hither sometimes in the summer with collations, and smugglers
make them storehouses for clandestine merchandise.&nbsp; It is hardly
to be doubted but the pirates of ancient times often used them as magazines
of arms, or repositories of plunder.</p>
<p>To the little vessels used by the northern rovers, the Buller may
have served as a shelter from storms, and perhaps as a retreat from
enemies; the entrance might have been stopped, or guarded with little
difficulty, and though the vessels that were stationed within would
have been battered with stones showered on them from above, yet the
crews would have lain safe in the caverns.</p>
<p>Next morning we continued our journey, pleased with our reception
at Slanes Castle, of which we had now leisure to recount the grandeur
and the elegance; for our way afforded us few topics of conversation.&nbsp;
The ground was neither uncultivated nor unfruitful; but it was still
all arable.&nbsp; Of flocks or herds there was no appearance.&nbsp;
I had now travelled two hundred miles in Scotland, and seen only one
tree not younger than myself.</p>
<h2>BAMFF</h2>
<p>We dined this day at the house of Mr. Frazer of Streichton, who shewed
us in his grounds some stones yet standing of a druidical circle, and
what I began to think more worthy of notice, some forest trees of full
growth.</p>
<p>At night we came to Bamff, where I remember nothing that particularly
claimed my attention.&nbsp; The ancient towns of Scotland have generally
an appearance unusual to Englishmen.&nbsp; The houses, whether great
or small, are for the most part built of stones.&nbsp; Their ends are
now and then next the streets, and the entrance into them is very often
by a flight of steps, which reaches up to the second story, the floor
which is level with the ground being entered only by stairs descending
within the house.</p>
<p>The art of joining squares of glass with lead is little used in Scotland,
and in some places is totally forgotten.&nbsp; The frames of their windows
are all of wood.&nbsp; They are more frugal of their glass than the
English, and will often, in houses not otherwise mean, compose a square
of two pieces, not joining like cracked glass, but with one edge laid
perhaps half an inch over the other.&nbsp; Their windows do not move
upon hinges, but are pushed up and drawn down in grooves, yet they are
seldom accommodated with weights and pullies.&nbsp; He that would have
his window open must hold it with his hand, unless what may be sometimes
found among good contrivers, there be a nail which he may stick into
a hole, to keep it from falling.</p>
<p>What cannot be done without some uncommon trouble or particular expedient,
will not often be done at all.&nbsp; The incommodiousness of the Scotch
windows keeps them very closely shut.&nbsp; The necessity of ventilating
human habitations has not yet been found by our northern neighbours;
and even in houses well built and elegantly furnished, a stranger may
be sometimes forgiven, if he allows himself to wish for fresher air.</p>
<p>These diminutive observations seem to take away something from the
dignity of writing, and therefore are never communicated but with hesitation,
and a little fear of abasement and contempt.&nbsp; But it must be remembered,
that life consists not of a series of illustrious actions, or elegant
enjoyments; the greater part of our time passes in compliance with necessities,
in the performance of daily duties, in the removal of small inconveniences,
in the procurement of petty pleasures; and we are well or ill at ease,
as the main stream of life glides on smoothly, or is ruffled by small
obstacles and frequent interruption.&nbsp; The true state of every nation
is the state of common life.&nbsp; The manners of a people are not to
be found in the schools of learning, or the palaces of greatness, where
the national character is obscured or obliterated by travel or instruction,
by philosophy or vanity; nor is public happiness to be estimated by
the assemblies of the gay, or the banquets of the rich.&nbsp; The great
mass of nations is neither rich nor gay: they whose aggregate constitutes
the people, are found in the streets, and the villages, in the shops
and farms; and from them collectively considered, must the measure of
general prosperity be taken.&nbsp; As they approach to delicacy a nation
is refined, as their conveniences are multiplied, a nation, at least
a commercial nation, must be denominated wealthy.</p>
<h2>ELGIN</h2>
<p>Finding nothing to detain us at Bamff, we set out in the morning,
and having breakfasted at Cullen, about noon came to Elgin, where in
the inn, that we supposed the best, a dinner was set before us, which
we could not eat.&nbsp; This was the first time, and except one, the
last, that I found any reason to complain of a Scotish table; and such
disappointments, I suppose, must be expected in every country, where
there is no great frequency of travellers.</p>
<p>The ruins of the cathedral of Elgin afforded us another proof of
the waste of reformation.&nbsp; There is enough yet remaining to shew,
that it was once magnificent.&nbsp; Its whole plot is easily traced.&nbsp;
On the north side of the choir, the chapter-house, which is roofed with
an arch of stone, remains entire; and on the south side, another mass
of building, which we could not enter, is preserved by the care of the
family of Gordon; but the body of the church is a mass of fragments.</p>
<p>A paper was here put into our hands, which deduced from sufficient
authorities the history of this venerable ruin.&nbsp; The church of
Elgin had, in the intestine tumults of the barbarous ages, been laid
waste by the irruption of a highland chief, whom the bishop had offended;
but it was gradually restored to the state, of which the traces may
be now discerned, and was at last not destroyed by the tumultuous violence
of Knox, but more shamefully suffered to dilapidate by deliberate robbery
and frigid indifference.&nbsp; There is still extant, in the books of
the council, an order, of which I cannot remember the date, but which
was doubtless issued after the Reformation, directing that the lead,
which covers the two cathedrals of Elgin and Aberdeen, shall be taken
away, and converted into money for the support of the army.&nbsp; A
Scotch army was in those times very cheaply kept; yet the lead of two
churches must have born so small a proportion to any military expence,
that it is hard not to believe the reason alleged to be merely popular,
and the money intended for some private purse.&nbsp; The order however
was obeyed; the two churches were stripped, and the lead was shipped
to be sold in Holland.&nbsp; I hope every reader will rejoice that this
cargo of sacrilege was lost at sea.</p>
<p>Let us not however make too much haste to despise our neighbours.&nbsp;
Our own cathedrals are mouldering by unregarded dilapidation.&nbsp;
It seems to be part of the despicable philosophy of the time to despise
monuments of sacred magnificence, and we are in danger of doing that
deliberately, which the Scots did not do but in the unsettled state
of an imperfect constitution.</p>
<p>Those who had once uncovered the cathedrals never wished to cover
them again; and being thus made useless, they were, first neglected,
and perhaps, as the stone was wanted, afterwards demolished.</p>
<p>Elgin seems a place of little trade, and thinly inhabited.&nbsp;
The episcopal cities of Scotland, I believe, generally fell with their
churches, though some of them have since recovered by a situation convenient
for commerce.&nbsp; Thus Glasgow, though it has no longer an archbishop,
has risen beyond its original state by the opulence of its traders;
and Aberdeen, though its ancient stock had decayed, flourishes by a
new shoot in another place.</p>
<p>In the chief street of Elgin, the houses jut over the lowest story,
like the old buildings of timber in London, but with greater prominence;
so that there is sometimes a walk for a considerable length under a
cloister, or portico, which is now indeed frequently broken, because
the new houses have another form, but seems to have been uniformly continued
in the old city.</p>
<h2>FORES.&nbsp; CALDER.&nbsp; FORT GEORGE</h2>
<p>We went forwards the same day to Fores, the town to which Macbeth
was travelling, when he met the weird sisters in his way.&nbsp; This
to an Englishman is classic ground.&nbsp; Our imaginations were heated,
and our thoughts recalled to their old amusements.</p>
<p>We had now a prelude to the Highlands.&nbsp; We began to leave fertility
and culture behind us, and saw for a great length of road nothing but
heath; yet at Fochabars, a seat belonging to the duke of Gordon, there
is an orchard, which in Scotland I had never seen before, with some
timber trees, and a plantation of oaks.</p>
<p>At Fores we found good accommodation, but nothing worthy of particular
remark, and next morning entered upon the road, on which Macbeth heard
the fatal prediction; but we travelled on not interrupted by promises
of kingdoms, and came to Nairn, a royal burgh, which, if once it flourished,
is now in a state of miserable decay; but I know not whether its chief
annual magistrate has not still the title of Lord Provost.</p>
<p>At Nairn we may fix the verge of the Highlands; for here I first
saw peat fires, and first heard the Erse language.&nbsp; We had no motive
to stay longer than to breakfast, and went forward to the house of Mr.
Macaulay, the minister who published an account of St. Kilda, and by
his direction visited Calder Castle, from which Macbeth drew his second
title.&nbsp; It has been formerly a place of strength.&nbsp; The drawbridge
is still to be seen, but the moat is now dry.&nbsp; The tower is very
ancient: Its walls are of great thickness, arched on the top with stone,
and surrounded with battlements.&nbsp; The rest of the house is later,
though far from modern.</p>
<p>We were favoured by a gentleman, who lives in the castle, with a
letter to one of the officers at Fort George, which being the most regular
fortification in the island, well deserves the notice of a traveller,
who has never travelled before.&nbsp; We went thither next day, found
a very kind reception, were led round the works by a gentleman, who
explained the use of every part, and entertained by Sir Eyre Coote,
the governour, with such elegance of conversation as left us no attention
to the delicacies of his table.</p>
<p>Of Fort George I shall not attempt to give any account.&nbsp; I cannot
delineate it scientifically, and a loose and popular description is
of use only when the imagination is to be amused.&nbsp; There was every
where an appearance of the utmost neatness and regularity.&nbsp; But
my suffrage is of little value, because this and Fort Augustus are the
only garrisons that I ever saw.</p>
<p>We did not regret the time spent at the fort, though in consequence
of our delay we came somewhat late to Inverness, the town which may
properly be called the capital of the Highlands.&nbsp; Hither the inhabitants
of the inland parts come to be supplied with what they cannot make for
themselves: Hither the young nymphs of the mountains and valleys are
sent for education, and as far as my observation has reached, are not
sent in vain.</p>
<h2>INVERNESS</h2>
<p>Inverness was the last place which had a regular communication by
high roads with the southern counties.&nbsp; All the ways beyond it
have, I believe, been made by the soldiers in this century.&nbsp; At
Inverness therefore Cromwell, when he subdued Scotland, stationed a
garrison, as at the boundary of the Highlands.&nbsp; The soldiers seem
to have incorporated afterwards with the inhabitants, and to have peopled
the place with an English race; for the language of this town has been
long considered as peculiarly elegant.</p>
<p>Here is a castle, called the castle of Macbeth, the walls of which
are yet standing.&nbsp; It was no very capacious edifice, but stands
upon a rock so high and steep, that I think it was once not accessible,
but by the help of ladders, or a bridge.&nbsp; Over against it, on another
hill, was a fort built by Cromwell, now totally demolished; for no faction
of Scotland loved the name of Cromwell, or had any desire to continue
his memory.</p>
<p>Yet what the Romans did to other nations, was in a great degree done
by Cromwell to the Scots; he civilized them by conquest, and introduced
by useful violence the arts of peace.&nbsp; I was told at Aberdeen that
the people learned from Cromwell&rsquo;s soldiers to make shoes and
to plant kail.</p>
<p>How they lived without kail, it is not easy to guess: They cultivate
hardly any other plant for common tables, and when they had not kail
they probably had nothing.&nbsp; The numbers that go barefoot are still
sufficient to shew that shoes may be spared: They are not yet considered
as necessaries of life; for tall boys, not otherwise meanly dressed,
run without them in the streets; and in the islands the sons of gentlemen
pass several of their first years with naked feet.</p>
<p>I know not whether it be not peculiar to the Scots to have attained
the liberal, without the manual arts, to have excelled in ornamental
knowledge, and to have wanted not only the elegancies, but the conveniences
of common life.&nbsp; Literature soon after its revival found its way
to Scotland, and from the middle of the sixteenth century, almost to
the middle of the seventeenth, the politer studies were very diligently
pursued.&nbsp; The Latin poetry of <i>Delici&aelig; Po&euml;tarum Scotorum</i>
would have done honour to any nation, at least till the publication
of <i>May&rsquo;s Supplement</i> the English had very little to oppose.</p>
<p>Yet men thus ingenious and inquisitive were content to live in total
ignorance of the trades by which human wants are supplied, and to supply
them by the grossest means.&nbsp; Till the Union made them acquainted
with English manners, the culture of their lands was unskilful, and
their domestick life unformed; their tables were coarse as the feasts
of Eskimeaux, and their houses filthy as the cottages of Hottentots.</p>
<p>Since they have known that their condition was capable of improvement,
their progress in useful knowledge has been rapid and uniform.&nbsp;
What remains to be done they will quickly do, and then wonder, like
me, why that which was so necessary and so easy was so long delayed.&nbsp;
But they must be for ever content to owe to the English that elegance
and culture, which, if they had been vigilant and active, perhaps the
English might have owed to them.</p>
<p>Here the appearance of life began to alter.&nbsp; I had seen a few
women with plaids at Aberdeen; but at Inverness the Highland manners
are common.&nbsp; There is I think a kirk, in which only the Erse language
is used.&nbsp; There is likewise an English chapel, but meanly built,
where on Sunday we saw a very decent congregation.</p>
<p>We were now to bid farewel to the luxury of travelling, and to enter
a country upon which perhaps no wheel has ever rolled.&nbsp; We could
indeed have used our post-chaise one day longer, along the military
road to Fort Augustus, but we could have hired no horses beyond Inverness,
and we were not so sparing of ourselves, as to lead them, merely that
we might have one day longer the indulgence of a carriage.</p>
<p>At Inverness therefore we procured three horses for ourselves and
a servant, and one more for our baggage, which was no very heavy load.&nbsp;
We found in the course of our journey the convenience of having disencumbered
ourselves, by laying aside whatever we could spare; for it is not to
be imagined without experience, how in climbing crags, and treading
bogs, and winding through narrow and obstructed passages, a little bulk
will hinder, and a little weight will burthen; or how often a man that
has pleased himself at home with his own resolution, will, in the hour
of darkness and fatigue, be content to leave behind him every thing
but himself.</p>
<h2>LOUGH NESS</h2>
<p>We took two Highlanders to run beside us, partly to shew us the way,
and partly to take back from the sea-side the horses, of which they
were the owners.&nbsp; One of them was a man of great liveliness and
activity, of whom his companion said, that he would tire any horse in
Inverness.&nbsp; Both of them were civil and ready-handed.&nbsp; Civility
seems part of the national character of Highlanders.&nbsp; Every chieftain
is a monarch, and politeness, the natural product of royal government,
is diffused from the laird through the whole clan.&nbsp; But they are
not commonly dexterous: their narrowness of life confines them to a
few operations, and they are accustomed to endure little wants more
than to remove them.</p>
<p>We mounted our steeds on the thirtieth of August, and directed our
guides to conduct us to Fort Augustus.&nbsp; It is built at the head
of Lough Ness, of which Inverness stands at the outlet.&nbsp; The way
between them has been cut by the soldiers, and the greater part of it
runs along a rock, levelled with great labour and exactness, near the
water-side.</p>
<p>Most of this day&rsquo;s journey was very pleasant.&nbsp; The day,
though bright, was not hot; and the appearance of the country, if I
had not seen the Peak, would have been wholly new.&nbsp; We went upon
a surface so hard and level, that we had little care to hold the bridle,
and were therefore at full leisure for contemplation.&nbsp; On the left
were high and steep rocks shaded with birch, the hardy native of the
North, and covered with fern or heath.&nbsp; On the right the limpid
waters of Lough Ness were beating their bank, and waving their surface
by a gentle agitation.&nbsp; Beyond them were rocks sometimes covered
with verdure, and sometimes towering in horrid nakedness.&nbsp; Now
and then we espied a little cornfield, which served to impress more
strongly the general barrenness.</p>
<p>Lough Ness is about twenty-four miles long, and from one mile to
two miles broad.&nbsp; It is remarkable that Boethius, in his description
of Scotland, gives it twelve miles of breadth.&nbsp; When historians
or geographers exhibit false accounts of places far distant, they may
be forgiven, because they can tell but what they are told; and that
their accounts exceed the truth may be justly supposed, because most
men exaggerate to others, if not to themselves: but Boethius lived at
no great distance; if he never saw the lake, he must have been very
incurious, and if he had seen it, his veracity yielded to very slight
temptations.</p>
<p>Lough Ness, though not twelve miles broad, is a very remarkable diffusion
of water without islands.&nbsp; It fills a large hollow between two
ridges of high rocks, being supplied partly by the torrents which fall
into it on either side, and partly, as is supposed, by springs at the
bottom.&nbsp; Its water is remarkably clear and pleasant, and is imagined
by the natives to be medicinal.&nbsp; We were told, that it is in some
places a hundred and forty fathoms deep, a profundity scarcely credible,
and which probably those that relate it have never sounded.&nbsp; Its
fish are salmon, trout, and pike.</p>
<p>It was said at fort Augustus, that Lough Ness is open in the hardest
winters, though a lake not far from it is covered with ice.&nbsp; In
discussing these exceptions from the course of nature, the first question
is, whether the fact be justly stated.&nbsp; That which is strange is
delightful, and a pleasing error is not willingly detected.&nbsp; Accuracy
of narration is not very common, and there are few so rigidly philosophical,
as not to represent as perpetual, what is only frequent, or as constant,
what is really casual.&nbsp; If it be true that Lough Ness never freezes,
it is either sheltered by its high banks from the cold blasts, and exposed
only to those winds which have more power to agitate than congeal; or
it is kept in perpetual motion by the rush of streams from the rocks
that inclose it.&nbsp; Its profundity though it should be such as is
represented can have little part in this exemption; for though deep
wells are not frozen, because their water is secluded from the external
air, yet where a wide surface is exposed to the full influence of a
freezing atmosphere, I know not why the depth should keep it open.&nbsp;
Natural philosophy is now one of the favourite studies of the Scottish
nation, and Lough Ness well deserves to be diligently examined.</p>
<p>The road on which we travelled, and which was itself a source of
entertainment, is made along the rock, in the direction of the lough,
sometimes by breaking off protuberances, and sometimes by cutting the
great mass of stone to a considerable depth.&nbsp; The fragments are
piled in a loose wall on either side, with apertures left at very short
spaces, to give a passage to the wintry currents.&nbsp; Part of it is
bordered with low trees, from which our guides gathered nuts, and would
have had the appearance of an English lane, except that an English lane
is almost always dirty.&nbsp; It has been made with great labour, but
has this advantage, that it cannot, without equal labour, be broken
up.</p>
<p>Within our sight there were goats feeding or playing.&nbsp; The mountains
have red deer, but they came not within view; and if what is said of
their vigilance and subtlety be true, they have some claim to that palm
of wisdom, which the eastern philosopher, whom Alexander interrogated,
gave to those beasts which live furthest from men.</p>
<p>Near the way, by the water side, we espied a cottage.&nbsp; This
was the first Highland Hut that I had seen; and as our business was
with life and manners, we were willing to visit it.&nbsp; To enter a
habitation without leave, seems to be not considered here as rudeness
or intrusion.&nbsp; The old laws of hospitality still give this licence
to a stranger.</p>
<p>A hut is constructed with loose stones, ranged for the most part
with some tendency to circularity.&nbsp; It must be placed where the
wind cannot act upon it with violence, because it has no cement; and
where the water will run easily away, because it has no floor but the
naked ground.&nbsp; The wall, which is commonly about six feet high,
declines from the perpendicular a little inward.&nbsp; Such rafters
as can be procured are then raised for a roof, and covered with heath,
which makes a strong and warm thatch, kept from flying off by ropes
of twisted heath, of which the ends, reaching from the center of the
thatch to the top of the wall, are held firm by the weight of a large
stone.&nbsp; No light is admitted but at the entrance, and through a
hole in the thatch, which gives vent to the smoke.&nbsp; This hole is
not directly over the fire, lest the rain should extinguish it; and
the smoke therefore naturally fills the place before it escapes.&nbsp;
Such is the general structure of the houses in which one of the nations
of this opulent and powerful island has been hitherto content to live.&nbsp;
Huts however are not more uniform than palaces; and this which we were
inspecting was very far from one of the meanest, for it was divided
into several apartments; and its inhabitants possessed such property
as a pastoral poet might exalt into riches.</p>
<p>When we entered, we found an old woman boiling goats-flesh in a kettle.&nbsp;
She spoke little English, but we had interpreters at hand; and she was
willing enough to display her whole system of economy.&nbsp; She has
five children, of which none are yet gone from her.&nbsp; The eldest,
a boy of thirteen, and her husband, who is eighty years old, were at
work in the wood.&nbsp; Her two next sons were gone to Inverness to
buy meal, by which oatmeal is always meant.&nbsp; Meal she considered
as expensive food, and told us, that in Spring, when the goats gave
milk, the children could live without it.&nbsp; She is mistress of sixty
goats, and I saw many kids in an enclosure at the end of her house.&nbsp;
She had also some poultry.&nbsp; By the lake we saw a potatoe-garden,
and a small spot of ground on which stood four shucks, containing each
twelve sheaves of barley.&nbsp; She has all this from the labour of
their own hands, and for what is necessary to be bought, her kids and
her chickens are sent to market.</p>
<p>With the true pastoral hospitality, she asked us to sit down and
drink whisky.&nbsp; She is religious, and though the kirk is four miles
off, probably eight English miles, she goes thither every Sunday.&nbsp;
We gave her a shilling, and she begged snuff; for snuff is the luxury
of a Highland cottage.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards we came to the General&rsquo;s Hut, so called because
it was the temporary abode of Wade, while he superintended the works
upon the road.&nbsp; It is now a house of entertainment for passengers,
and we found it not ill stocked with provisions.</p>
<h2>FALL OF FIERS</h2>
<p>Towards evening we crossed, by a bridge, the river which makes the
celebrated fall of Fiers.&nbsp; The country at the bridge strikes the
imagination with all the gloom and grandeur of Siberian solitude.&nbsp;
The way makes a flexure, and the mountains, covered with trees, rise
at once on the left hand and in the front.&nbsp; We desired our guides
to shew us the fall, and dismounting, clambered over very rugged crags,
till I began to wish that our curiosity might have been gratified with
less trouble and danger.&nbsp; We came at last to a place where we could
overlook the river, and saw a channel torn, as it seems, through black
piles of stone, by which the stream is obstructed and broken, till it
comes to a very steep descent, of such dreadful depth, that we were
naturally inclined to turn aside our eyes.</p>
<p>But we visited the place at an unseasonable time, and found it divested
of its dignity and terror.&nbsp; Nature never gives every thing at once.&nbsp;
A long continuance of dry weather, which made the rest of the way easy
and delightful, deprived us of the pleasure expected from the fall of
Fiers.&nbsp; The river having now no water but what the springs supply,
showed us only a swift current, clear and shallow, fretting over the
asperities of the rocky bottom, and we were left to exercise our thoughts,
by endeavouring to conceive the effect of a thousand streams poured
from the mountains into one channel, struggling for expansion in a narrow
passage, exasperated by rocks rising in their way, and at last discharging
all their violence of waters by a sudden fall through the horrid chasm.</p>
<p>The way now grew less easy, descending by an uneven declivity, but
without either dirt or danger.&nbsp; We did not arrive at Fort Augustus
till it was late.&nbsp; Mr. Boswell, who, between his father&rsquo;s
merit and his own, is sure of reception wherever he comes, sent a servant
before to beg admission and entertainment for that night.&nbsp; Mr.
Trapaud, the governor, treated us with that courtesy which is so closely
connected with the military character.&nbsp; He came out to meet us
beyond the gates, and apologized that, at so late an hour, the rules
of a garrison suffered him to give us entrance only at the postern.</p>
<h2>FORT AUGUSTUS</h2>
<p>In the morning we viewed the fort, which is much less than that of
St. George, and is said to be commanded by the neighbouring hills.&nbsp;
It was not long ago taken by the Highlanders.&nbsp; But its situation
seems well chosen for pleasure, if not for strength; it stands at the
head of the lake, and, by a sloop of sixty tuns, is supplied from Inverness
with great convenience.</p>
<p>We were now to cross the Highlands towards the western coast, and
to content ourselves with such accommodations, as a way so little frequented
could afford.&nbsp; The journey was not formidable, for it was but of
two days, very unequally divided, because the only house, where we could
be entertained, was not further off than a third of the way.&nbsp; We
soon came to a high hill, which we mounted by a military road, cut in
traverses, so that as we went upon a higher stage, we saw the baggage
following us below in a contrary direction.&nbsp; To make this way,
the rock has been hewn to a level with labour that might have broken
the perseverance of a Roman legion.</p>
<p>The country is totally denuded of its wood, but the stumps both of
oaks and firs, which are still found, shew that it has been once a forest
of large timber.&nbsp; I do not remember that we saw any animals, but
we were told that, in the mountains, there are stags, roebucks, goats
and rabbits.</p>
<p>We did not perceive that this tract was possessed by human beings,
except that once we saw a corn field, in which a lady was walking with
some gentlemen.&nbsp; Their house was certainly at no great distance,
but so situated that we could not descry it.</p>
<p>Passing on through the dreariness of solitude, we found a party of
soldiers from the fort, working on the road, under the superintendence
of a serjeant.&nbsp; We told them how kindly we had been treated at
the garrison, and as we were enjoying the benefit of their labours,
begged leave to shew our gratitude by a small present.</p>
<h2>ANOCH</h2>
<p>Early in the afternoon we came to Anoch, a village in Glenmollison
of three huts, one of which is distinguished by a chimney.&nbsp; Here
we were to dine and lodge, and were conducted through the first room,
that had the chimney, into another lighted by a small glass window.&nbsp;
The landlord attended us with great civility, and told us what he could
give us to eat and drink.&nbsp; I found some books on a shelf, among
which were a volume or more of Prideaux&rsquo;s Connection.</p>
<p>This I mentioned as something unexpected, and perceived that I did
not please him.&nbsp; I praised the propriety of his language, and was
answered that I need not wonder, for he had learned it by grammar.</p>
<p>By subsequent opportunities of observation, I found that my host&rsquo;s
diction had nothing peculiar.&nbsp; Those Highlanders that can speak
English, commonly speak it well, with few of the words, and little of
the tone by which a Scotchman is distinguished.&nbsp; Their language
seems to have been learned in the army or the navy, or by some communication
with those who could give them good examples of accent and pronunciation.&nbsp;
By their Lowland neighbours they would not willingly be taught; for
they have long considered them as a mean and degenerate race.&nbsp;
These prejudices are wearing fast away; but so much of them still remains,
that when I asked a very learned minister in the islands, which they
considered as their most savage clans: &lsquo;Those,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;that live next the Lowlands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As we came hither early in the day, we had time sufficient to survey
the place.&nbsp; The house was built like other huts of loose stones,
but the part in which we dined and slept was lined with turf and wattled
with twigs, which kept the earth from falling.&nbsp; Near it was a garden
of turnips and a field of potatoes.&nbsp; It stands in a glen, or valley,
pleasantly watered by a winding river.&nbsp; But this country, however
it may delight the gazer or amuse the naturalist, is of no great advantage
to its owners.&nbsp; Our landlord told us of a gentleman, who possesses
lands, eighteen Scotch miles in length, and three in breadth; a space
containing at least a hundred square English miles.&nbsp; He has raised
his rents, to the danger of depopulating his farms, and he fells his
timber, and by exerting every art of augmentation, has obtained an yearly
revenue of four hundred pounds, which for a hundred square miles is
three halfpence an acre.</p>
<p>Some time after dinner we were surprised by the entrance of a young
woman, not inelegant either in mien or dress, who asked us whether we
would have tea.&nbsp; We found that she was the daughter of our host,
and desired her to make it.&nbsp; Her conversation, like her appearance,
was gentle and pleasing.&nbsp; We knew that the girls of the Highlands
are all gentlewomen, and treated her with great respect, which she received
as customary and due, and was neither elated by it, nor confused, but
repaid my civilities without embarassment, and told me how much I honoured
her country by coming to survey it.</p>
<p>She had been at Inverness to gain the common female qualifications,
and had, like her father, the English pronunciation.&nbsp; I presented
her with a book, which I happened to have about me, and should not be
pleased to think that she forgets me.</p>
<p>In the evening the soldiers, whom we had passed on the road, came
to spend at our inn the little money that we had given them.&nbsp; They
had the true military impatience of coin in their pockets, and had marched
at least six miles to find the first place where liquor could be bought.&nbsp;
Having never been before in a place so wild and unfrequented, I was
glad of their arrival, because I knew that we had made them friends,
and to gain still more of their good will, we went to them, where they
were carousing in the barn, and added something to our former gift.&nbsp;
All that we gave was not much, but it detained them in the barn, either
merry or quarrelling, the whole night, and in the morning they went
back to their work, with great indignation at the bad qualities of whisky.</p>
<p>We had gained so much the favour of our host, that, when we left
his house in the morning, he walked by us a great way, and entertained
us with conversation both on his own condition, and that of the country.&nbsp;
His life seemed to be merely pastoral, except that he differed from
some of the ancient Nomades in having a settled dwelling.&nbsp; His
wealth consists of one hundred sheep, as many goats, twelve milk-cows,
and twenty-eight beeves ready for the drover.</p>
<p>From him we first heard of the general dissatisfaction, which is
now driving the Highlanders into the other hemisphere; and when I asked
him whether they would stay at home, if they were well treated, he answered
with indignation, that no man willingly left his native country.&nbsp;
Of the farm, which he himself occupied, the rent had, in twenty-five
years, been advanced from five to twenty pounds, which he found himself
so little able to pay, that he would be glad to try his fortune in some
other place.&nbsp; Yet he owned the reasonableness of raising the Highland
rents in a certain degree, and declared himself willing to pay ten pounds
for the ground which he had formerly had for five.</p>
<p>Our host having amused us for a time, resigned us to our guides.&nbsp;
The journey of this day was long, not that the distance was great, but
that the way was difficult.&nbsp; We were now in the bosom of the Highlands,
with full leisure to contemplate the appearance and properties of mountainous
regions, such as have been, in many countries, the last shelters of
national distress, and are every where the scenes of adventures, stratagems,
surprises and escapes.</p>
<p>Mountainous countries are not passed but with difficulty, not merely
from the labour of climbing; for to climb is not always necessary: but
because that which is not mountain is commonly bog, through which the
way must be picked with caution.&nbsp; Where there are hills, there
is much rain, and the torrents pouring down into the intermediate spaces,
seldom find so ready an outlet, as not to stagnate, till they have broken
the texture of the ground.</p>
<p>Of the hills, which our journey offered to the view on either side,
we did not take the height, nor did we see any that astonished us with
their loftiness.&nbsp; Towards the summit of one, there was a white
spot, which I should have called a naked rock, but the guides, who had
better eyes, and were acquainted with the phenomena of the country,
declared it to be snow.&nbsp; It had already lasted to the end of August,
and was likely to maintain its contest with the sun, till it should
be reinforced by winter.</p>
<p>The height of mountains philosophically considered is properly computed
from the surface of the next sea; but as it affects the eye or imagination
of the passenger, as it makes either a spectacle or an obstruction,
it must be reckoned from the place where the rise begins to make a considerable
angle with the plain.&nbsp; In extensive continents the land may, by
gradual elevation, attain great height, without any other appearance
than that of a plane gently inclined, and if a hill placed upon such
raised ground be described, as having its altitude equal to the whole
space above the sea, the representation will be fallacious.</p>
<p>These mountains may be properly enough measured from the inland base;
for it is not much above the sea.&nbsp; As we advanced at evening towards
the western coast, I did not observe the declivity to be greater than
is necessary for the discharge of the inland waters.</p>
<p>We passed many rivers and rivulets, which commonly ran with a clear
shallow stream over a hard pebbly bottom.&nbsp; These channels, which
seem so much wider than the water that they convey would naturally require,
are formed by the violence of wintry floods, produced by the accumulation
of innumerable streams that fall in rainy weather from the hills, and
bursting away with resistless impetuosity, make themselves a passage
proportionate to their mass.</p>
<p>Such capricious and temporary waters cannot be expected to produce
many fish.&nbsp; The rapidity of the wintry deluge sweeps them away,
and the scantiness of the summer stream would hardly sustain them above
the ground.&nbsp; This is the reason why in fording the northern rivers,
no fishes are seen, as in England, wandering in the water.</p>
<p>Of the hills many may be called with Homer&rsquo;s Ida &lsquo;abundant
in springs&rsquo;, but few can deserve the epithet which he bestows
upon Pelion by &lsquo;waving their leaves.&rsquo;&nbsp; They exhibit
very little variety; being almost wholly covered with dark heath, and
even that seems to be checked in its growth.&nbsp; What is not heath
is nakedness, a little diversified by now and then a stream rushing
down the steep.&nbsp; An eye accustomed to flowery pastures and waving
harvests is astonished and repelled by this wide extent of hopeless
sterility.&nbsp; The appearance is that of matter incapable of form
or usefulness, dismissed by nature from her care and disinherited of
her favours, left in its original elemental state, or quickened only
with one sullen power of useless vegetation.</p>
<p>It will very readily occur, that this uniformity of barrenness can
afford very little amusement to the traveller; that it is easy to sit
at home and conceive rocks and heath, and waterfalls; and that these
journeys are useless labours, which neither impregnate the imagination,
nor enlarge the understanding.&nbsp; It is true that of far the greater
part of things, we must content ourselves with such knowledge as description
may exhibit, or analogy supply; but it is true likewise, that these
ideas are always incomplete, and that at least, till we have compared
them with realities, we do not know them to be just.&nbsp; As we see
more, we become possessed of more certainties, and consequently gain
more principles of reasoning, and found a wider basis of analogy.</p>
<p>Regions mountainous and wild, thinly inhabited, and little cultivated,
make a great part of the earth, and he that has never seen them, must
live unacquainted with much of the face of nature, and with one of the
great scenes of human existence.</p>
<p>As the day advanced towards noon, we entered a narrow valley not
very flowery, but sufficiently verdant.&nbsp; Our guides told us, that
the horses could not travel all day without rest or meat, and intreated
us to stop here, because no grass would be found in any other place.&nbsp;
The request was reasonable and the argument cogent.&nbsp; We therefore
willingly dismounted and diverted ourselves as the place gave us opportunity.</p>
<p>I sat down on a bank, such as a writer of Romance might have delighted
to feign.&nbsp; I had indeed no trees to whisper over my head, but a
clear rivulet streamed at my feet.&nbsp; The day was calm, the air soft,
and all was rudeness, silence, and solitude.&nbsp; Before me, and on
either side, were high hills, which by hindering the eye from ranging,
forced the mind to find entertainment for itself.&nbsp; Whether I spent
the hour well I know not; for here I first conceived the thought of
this narration.</p>
<p>We were in this place at ease and by choice, and had no evils to
suffer or to fear; yet the imaginations excited by the view of an unknown
and untravelled wilderness are not such as arise in the artificial solitude
of parks and gardens, a flattering notion of self-sufficiency, a placid
indulgence of voluntary delusions, a secure expansion of the fancy,
or a cool concentration of the mental powers.&nbsp; The phantoms which
haunt a desert are want, and misery, and danger; the evils of dereliction
rush upon the thoughts; man is made unwillingly acquainted with his
own weakness, and meditation shows him only how little he can sustain,
and how little he can perform.&nbsp; There were no traces of inhabitants,
except perhaps a rude pile of clods called a summer hut, in which a
herdsman had rested in the favourable seasons.&nbsp; Whoever had been
in the place where I then sat, unprovided with provisions and ignorant
of the country, might, at least before the roads were made, have wandered
among the rocks, till he had perished with hardship, before he could
have found either food or shelter.&nbsp; Yet what are these hillocks
to the ridges of Taurus, or these spots of wildness to the desarts of
America?</p>
<p>It was not long before we were invited to mount, and continued our
journey along the side of a lough, kept full by many streams, which
with more or less rapidity and noise, crossed the road from the hills
on the other hand.&nbsp; These currents, in their diminished state,
after several dry months, afford, to one who has always lived in level
countries, an unusual and delightful spectacle; but in the rainy season,
such as every winter may be expected to bring, must precipitate an impetuous
and tremendous flood.&nbsp; I suppose the way by which we went, is at
that time impassable.</p>
<h2>GLENSHEALS</h2>
<p>The lough at last ended in a river broad and shallow like the rest,
but that it may be passed when it is deeper, there is a bridge over
it.&nbsp; Beyond it is a valley called Glensheals, inhabited by the
clan of Macrae.&nbsp; Here we found a village called Auknasheals, consisting
of many huts, perhaps twenty, built all of dry-stone, that is, stones
piled up without mortar.</p>
<p>We had, by the direction of the officers at Fort Augustus, taken
bread for ourselves, and tobacco for those Highlanders who might show
us any kindness.&nbsp; We were now at a place where we could obtain
milk, but we must have wanted bread if we had not brought it.&nbsp;
The people of this valley did not appear to know any English, and our
guides now became doubly necessary as interpreters.&nbsp; A woman, whose
hut was distinguished by greater spaciousness and better architecture,
brought out some pails of milk.&nbsp; The villagers gathered about us
in considerable numbers, I believe without any evil intention, but with
a very savage wildness of aspect and manner.&nbsp; When our meal was
over, Mr. Boswell sliced the bread, and divided it amongst them, as
he supposed them never to have tasted a wheaten loaf before.&nbsp; He
then gave them little pieces of twisted tobacco, and among the children
we distributed a small handful of halfpence, which they received with
great eagerness.&nbsp; Yet I have been since told, that the people of
that valley are not indigent; and when we mentioned them afterwards
as needy and pitiable, a Highland lady let us know, that we might spare
our commiseration; for the dame whose milk we drank had probably more
than a dozen milk-cows.&nbsp; She seemed unwilling to take any price,
but being pressed to make a demand, at last named a shilling.&nbsp;
Honesty is not greater where elegance is less.&nbsp; One of the bystanders,
as we were told afterwards, advised her to ask for more, but she said
a shilling was enough.&nbsp; We gave her half a crown, and I hope got
some credit for our behaviour; for the company said, if our interpreters
did not flatter us, that they had not seen such a day since the old
laird of Macleod passed through their country.</p>
<p>The Macraes, as we heard afterwards in the Hebrides, were originally
an indigent and subordinate clan, and having no farms nor stock, were
in great numbers servants to the Maclellans, who, in the war of Charles
the First, took arms at the call of the heroic Montrose, and were, in
one of his battles, almost all destroyed.&nbsp; The women that were
left at home, being thus deprived of their husbands, like the Scythian
ladies of old, married their servants, and the Macraes became a considerable
race.</p>
<h2>THE HIGHLANDS</h2>
<p>As we continued our journey, we were at leisure to extend our speculations,
and to investigate the reason of those peculiarities by which such rugged
regions as these before us are generally distinguished.</p>
<p>Mountainous countries commonly contain the original, at least the
oldest race of inhabitants, for they are not easily conquered, because
they must be entered by narrow ways, exposed to every power of mischief
from those that occupy the heights; and every new ridge is a new fortress,
where the defendants have again the same advantages.&nbsp; If the assailants
either force the strait, or storm the summit, they gain only so much
ground; their enemies are fled to take possession of the next rock,
and the pursuers stand at gaze, knowing neither where the ways of escape
wind among the steeps, nor where the bog has firmness to sustain them:
besides that, mountaineers have an agility in climbing and descending
distinct from strength or courage, and attainable only by use.</p>
<p>If the war be not soon concluded, the invaders are dislodged by hunger;
for in those anxious and toilsome marches, provisions cannot easily
be carried, and are never to be found.&nbsp; The wealth of mountains
is cattle, which, while the men stand in the passes, the women drive
away.&nbsp; Such lands at last cannot repay the expence of conquest,
and therefore perhaps have not been so often invaded by the mere ambition
of dominion; as by resentment of robberies and insults, or the desire
of enjoying in security the more fruitful provinces.</p>
<p>As mountains are long before they are conquered, they are likewise
long before they are civilized.&nbsp; Men are softened by intercourse
mutually profitable, and instructed by comparing their own notions with
those of others.&nbsp; Thus C&aelig;sar found the maritime parts of
Britain made less barbarous by their commerce with the Gauls.&nbsp;
Into a barren and rough tract no stranger is brought either by the hope
of gain or of pleasure.&nbsp; The inhabitants having neither commodities
for sale, nor money for purchase, seldom visit more polished places,
or if they do visit them, seldom return.</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that by conquest, intermixture, or gradual refinement,
the cultivated parts of a country change their language.&nbsp; The mountaineers
then become a distinct nation, cut off by dissimilitude of speech from
conversation with their neighbours.&nbsp; Thus in Biscay, the original
Cantabrian, and in Dalecarlia, the old Swedish still subsists.&nbsp;
Thus Wales and the Highlands speak the tongue of the first inhabitants
of Britain, while the other parts have received first the Saxon, and
in some degree afterwards the French, and then formed a third language
between them.</p>
<p>That the primitive manners are continued where the primitive language
is spoken, no nation will desire me to suppose, for the manners of mountaineers
are commonly savage, but they are rather produced by their situation
than derived from their ancestors.</p>
<p>Such seems to be the disposition of man, that whatever makes a distinction
produces rivalry.&nbsp; England, before other causes of enmity were
found, was disturbed for some centuries by the contests of the northern
and southern counties; so that at Oxford, the peace of study could for
a long time be preserved only by chusing annually one of the Proctors
from each side of the Trent.&nbsp; A tract intersected by many ridges
of mountains, naturally divides its inhabitants into petty nations,
which are made by a thousand causes enemies to each other.&nbsp; Each
will exalt its own chiefs, each will boast the valour of its men, or
the beauty of its women, and every claim of superiority irritates competition;
injuries will sometimes be done, and be more injuriously defended; retaliation
will sometimes be attempted, and the debt exacted with too much interest.</p>
<p>In the Highlands it was a law, that if a robber was sheltered from
justice, any man of the same clan might be taken in his place.&nbsp;
This was a kind of irregular justice, which, though necessary in savage
times, could hardly fail to end in a feud, and a feud once kindled among
an idle people with no variety of pursuits to divert their thoughts,
burnt on for ages either sullenly glowing in secret mischief, or openly
blazing into public violence.&nbsp; Of the effects of this violent judicature,
there are not wanting memorials.&nbsp; The cave is now to be seen to
which one of the Campbells, who had injured the Macdonalds, retired
with a body of his own clan.&nbsp; The Macdonalds required the offender,
and being refused, made a fire at the mouth of the cave, by which he
and his adherents were suffocated together.</p>
<p>Mountaineers are warlike, because by their feuds and competitions
they consider themselves as surrounded with enemies, and are always
prepared to repel incursions, or to make them.&nbsp; Like the Greeks
in their unpolished state, described by Thucydides, the Highlanders,
till lately, went always armed, and carried their weapons to visits,
and to church.</p>
<p>Mountaineers are thievish, because they are poor, and having neither
manufactures nor commerce, can grow richer only by robbery.&nbsp; They
regularly plunder their neighbours, for their neighbours are commonly
their enemies; and having lost that reverence for property, by which
the order of civil life is preserved, soon consider all as enemies,
whom they do not reckon as friends, and think themselves licensed to
invade whatever they are not obliged to protect.</p>
<p>By a strict administration of the laws, since the laws have been
introduced into the Highlands, this disposition to thievery is very
much represt.&nbsp; Thirty years ago no herd had ever been conducted
through the mountains, without paying tribute in the night, to some
of the clans; but cattle are now driven, and passengers travel without
danger, fear, or molestation.</p>
<p>Among a warlike people, the quality of highest esteem is personal
courage, and with the ostentatious display of courage are closely connected
promptitude of offence and quickness of resentment.&nbsp; The Highlanders,
before they were disarmed, were so addicted to quarrels, that the boys
used to follow any publick procession or ceremony, however festive,
or however solemn, in expectation of the battle, which was sure to happen
before the company dispersed.</p>
<p>Mountainous regions are sometimes so remote from the seat of government,
and so difficult of access, that they are very little under the influence
of the sovereign, or within the reach of national justice.&nbsp; Law
is nothing without power; and the sentence of a distant court could
not be easily executed, nor perhaps very safely promulgated, among men
ignorantly proud and habitually violent, unconnected with the general
system, and accustomed to reverence only their own lords.&nbsp; It has
therefore been necessary to erect many particular jurisdictions, and
commit the punishment of crimes, and the decision of right to the proprietors
of the country who could enforce their own decrees.&nbsp; It immediately
appears that such judges will be often ignorant, and often partial;
but in the immaturity of political establishments no better expedient
could be found.&nbsp; As government advances towards perfection, provincial
judicature is perhaps in every empire gradually abolished.</p>
<p>Those who had thus the dispensation of law, were by consequence themselves
lawless.&nbsp; Their vassals had no shelter from outrages and oppressions;
but were condemned to endure, without resistance, the caprices of wantonness,
and the rage of cruelty.</p>
<p>In the Highlands, some great lords had an hereditary jurisdiction
over counties; and some chieftains over their own lands; till the final
conquest of the Highlands afforded an opportunity of crushing all the
local courts, and of extending the general benefits of equal law to
the low and the high, in the deepest recesses and obscurest corners.</p>
<p>While the chiefs had this resemblance of royalty, they had little
inclination to appeal, on any question, to superior judicatures.&nbsp;
A claim of lands between two powerful lairds was decided like a contest
for dominion between sovereign powers.&nbsp; They drew their forces
into the field, and right attended on the strongest.&nbsp; This was,
in ruder times, the common practice, which the kings of Scotland could
seldom control.</p>
<p>Even so lately as in the last years of King William, a battle was
fought at Mull Roy, on a plain a few miles to the south of Inverness,
between the clans of Mackintosh and Macdonald of Keppoch.&nbsp; Col.&nbsp;
Macdonald, the head of a small clan, refused to pay the dues demanded
from him by Mackintosh, as his superior lord.&nbsp; They disdained the
interposition of judges and laws, and calling each his followers to
maintain the dignity of the clan, fought a formal battle, in which several
considerable men fell on the side of Mackintosh, without a complete
victory to either.&nbsp; This is said to have been the last open war
made between the clans by their own authority.</p>
<p>The Highland lords made treaties, and formed alliances, of which
some traces may still be found, and some consequences still remain as
lasting evidences of petty regality.&nbsp; The terms of one of these
confederacies were, that each should support the other in the right,
or in the wrong, except against the king.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of mountains form distinct races, and are careful
to preserve their genealogies.&nbsp; Men in a small district necessarily
mingle blood by intermarriages, and combine at last into one family,
with a common interest in the honour and disgrace of every individual.&nbsp;
Then begins that union of affections, and co-operation of endeavours,
that constitute a clan.&nbsp; They who consider themselves as ennobled
by their family, will think highly of their progenitors, and they who
through successive generations live always together in the same place,
will preserve local stories and hereditary prejudices.&nbsp; Thus every
Highlander can talk of his ancestors, and recount the outrages which
they suffered from the wicked inhabitants of the next valley.</p>
<p>Such are the effects of habitation among mountains, and such were
the qualities of the Highlanders, while their rocks secluded them from
the rest of mankind, and kept them an unaltered and discriminated race.&nbsp;
They are now losing their distinction, and hastening to mingle with
the general community.</p>
<h2>GLENELG</h2>
<p>We left Auknasheals and the Macraes its the afternoon, and in the
evening came to Ratiken, a high hill on which a road is cut, but so
steep and narrow, that it is very difficult.&nbsp; There is now a design
of making another way round the bottom.&nbsp; Upon one of the precipices,
my horse, weary with the steepness of the rise, staggered a little,
and I called in haste to the Highlander to hold him.&nbsp; This was
the only moment of my journey, in which I thought myself endangered.</p>
<p>Having surmounted the hill at last, we were told that at Glenelg,
on the sea-side, we should come to a house of lime and slate and glass.&nbsp;
This image of magnificence raised our expectation.&nbsp; At last we
came to our inn weary and peevish, and began to inquire for meat and
beds.</p>
<p>Of the provisions the negative catalogue was very copious.&nbsp;
Here was no meat, no milk, no bread, no eggs, no wine.&nbsp; We did
not express much satisfaction.&nbsp; Here however we were to stay.&nbsp;
Whisky we might have, and I believe at last they caught a fowl and killed
it.&nbsp; We had some bread, and with that we prepared ourselves to
be contented, when we had a very eminent proof of Highland hospitality.&nbsp;
Along some miles of the way, in the evening, a gentleman&rsquo;s servant
had kept us company on foot with very little notice on our part.&nbsp;
He left us near Glenelg, and we thought on him no more till he came
to us again, in about two hours, with a present from his master of rum
and sugar.&nbsp; The man had mentioned his company, and the gentleman,
whose name, I think, is Gordon, well knowing the penury of the place,
had this attention to two men, whose names perhaps he had not heard,
by whom his kindness was not likely to be ever repaid, and who could
be recommended to him only by their necessities.</p>
<p>We were now to examine our lodging.&nbsp; Out of one of the beds,
on which we were to repose, started up, at our entrance, a man black
as a Cyclops from the forge.&nbsp; Other circumstances of no elegant
recital concurred to disgust us.&nbsp; We had been frighted by a lady
at Edinburgh, with discouraging representations of Highland lodgings.&nbsp;
Sleep, however, was necessary.&nbsp; Our Highlanders had at last found
some hay, with which the inn could not supply them.&nbsp; I directed
them to bring a bundle into the room, and slept upon it in my riding
coat.&nbsp; Mr. Boswell being more delicate, laid himself sheets with
hay over and under him, and lay in linen like a gentleman.</p>
<h2>SKY.&nbsp; ARMIDEL</h2>
<p>In the morning, September the second, we found ourselves on the edge
of the sea.&nbsp; Having procured a boat, we dismissed our Highlanders,
whom I would recommend to the service of any future travellers, and
were ferried over to the Isle of Sky.&nbsp; We landed at Armidel, where
we were met on the sands by Sir Alexander Macdonald, who was at that
time there with his lady, preparing to leave the island and reside at
Edinburgh.</p>
<p>Armidel is a neat house, built where the Macdonalds had once a seat,
which was burnt in the commotions that followed the Revolution.&nbsp;
The walled orchard, which belonged to the former house, still remains.&nbsp;
It is well shaded by tall ash trees, of a species, as Mr. Janes the
fossilist informed me, uncommonly valuable.&nbsp; This plantation is
very properly mentioned by Dr. Campbell, in his new account of the state
of Britain, and deserves attention; because it proves that the present
nakedness of the Hebrides is not wholly the fault of Nature.</p>
<p>As we sat at Sir Alexander&rsquo;s table, we were entertained, according
to the ancient usage of the North, with the melody of the bagpipe.&nbsp;
Everything in those countries has its history.&nbsp; As the bagpiper
was playing, an elderly Gentleman informed us, that in some remote time,
the Macdonalds of Glengary having been injured, or offended by the inhabitants
of Culloden, and resolving to have justice or vengeance, came to Culloden
on a Sunday, where finding their enemies at worship, they shut them
up in the church, which they set on fire; and this, said he, is the
tune that the piper played while they were burning.</p>
<p>Narrations like this, however uncertain, deserve the notice of the
traveller, because they are the only records of a nation that has no
historians, and afford the most genuine representation of the life and
character of the ancient Highlanders.</p>
<p>Under the denomination of Highlander are comprehended in Scotland
all that now speak the Erse language, or retain the primitive manners,
whether they live among the mountains or in the islands; and in that
sense I use the name, when there is not some apparent reason for making
a distinction.</p>
<p>In Sky I first observed the use of Brogues, a kind of artless shoes,
stitched with thongs so loosely, that though they defend the foot from
stones, they do not exclude water.&nbsp; Brogues were formerly made
of raw hides, with the hair inwards, and such are perhaps still used
in rude and remote parts; but they are said not to last above two days.&nbsp;
Where life is somewhat improved, they are now made of leather tanned
with oak bark, as in other places, or with the bark of birch, or roots
of tormentil, a substance recommended in defect of bark, about forty
years ago, to the Irish tanners, by one to whom the parliament of that
kingdom voted a reward.&nbsp; The leather of Sky is not completely penetrated
by vegetable matter, and therefore cannot be very durable.</p>
<p>My inquiries about brogues, gave me an early specimen of Highland
information.&nbsp; One day I was told, that to make brogues was a domestick
art, which every man practised for himself, and that a pair of brogues
was the work of an hour.&nbsp; I supposed that the husband made brogues
as the wife made an apron, till next day it was told me, that a brogue-maker
was a trade, and that a pair would cost half a crown.&nbsp; It will
easily occur that these representations may both be true, and that,
in some places, men may buy them, and in others, make them for themselves;
but I had both the accounts in the same house within two days.</p>
<p>Many of my subsequent inquiries upon more interesting topicks ended
in the like uncertainty.&nbsp; He that travels in the Highlands may
easily saturate his soul with intelligence, if he will acquiesce in
the first account.&nbsp; The Highlander gives to every question an answer
so prompt and peremptory, that skepticism itself is dared into silence,
and the mind sinks before the bold reporter in unresisting credulity;
but, if a second question be ventured, it breaks the enchantment; for
it is immediately discovered, that what was told so confidently was
told at hazard, and that such fearlessness of assertion was either the
sport of negligence, or the refuge of ignorance.</p>
<p>If individuals are thus at variance with themselves, it can be no
wonder that the accounts of different men are contradictory.&nbsp; The
traditions of an ignorant and savage people have been for ages negligently
heard, and unskilfully related.&nbsp; Distant events must have been
mingled together, and the actions of one man given to another.&nbsp;
These, however, are deficiencies in story, for which no man is now to
be censured.&nbsp; It were enough, if what there is yet opportunity
of examining were accurately inspected, and justly represented; but
such is the laxity of Highland conversation, that the inquirer is kept
in continual suspense, and by a kind of intellectual retrogradation,
knows less as he hears more.</p>
<p>In the islands the plaid is rarely worn.&nbsp; The law by which the
Highlanders have been obliged to change the form of their dress, has,
in all the places that we have visited, been universally obeyed.&nbsp;
I have seen only one gentleman completely clothed in the ancient habit,
and by him it was worn only occasionally and wantonly.&nbsp; The common
people do not think themselves under any legal necessity of having coats;
for they say that the law against plaids was made by Lord Hardwicke,
and was in force only for his life: but the same poverty that made it
then difficult for them to change their clothing, hinders them now from
changing it again.</p>
<p>The fillibeg, or lower garment, is still very common, and the bonnet
almost universal; but their attire is such as produces, in a sufficient
degree, the effect intended by the law, of abolishing the dissimilitude
of appearance between the Highlanders and the other inhabitants of Britain;
and, if dress be supposed to have much influence, facilitates their
coalition with their fellow-subjects.</p>
<p>What we have long used we naturally like, and therefore the Highlanders
were unwilling to lay aside their plaid, which yet to an unprejudiced
spectator must appear an incommodious and cumbersome dress; for hanging
loose upon the body, it must flutter in a quick motion, or require one
of the hands to keep it close.&nbsp; The Romans always laid aside the
gown when they had anything to do.&nbsp; It was a dress so unsuitable
to war, that the same word which signified a gown signified peace.&nbsp;
The chief use of a plaid seems to be this, that they could commodiously
wrap themselves in it, when they were obliged to sleep without a better
cover.</p>
<p>In our passage from Scotland to Sky, we were wet for the first time
with a shower.&nbsp; This was the beginning of the Highland winter,
after which we were told that a succession of three dry days was not
to be expected for many months.&nbsp; The winter of the Hebrides consists
of little more than rain and wind.&nbsp; As they are surrounded by an
ocean never frozen, the blasts that come to them over the water are
too much softened to have the power of congelation.&nbsp; The salt loughs,
or inlets of the sea, which shoot very far into the island, never have
any ice upon them, and the pools of fresh water will never bear the
walker.&nbsp; The snow that sometimes falls, is soon dissolved by the
air, or the rain.</p>
<p>This is not the description of a cruel climate, yet the dark months
are here a time of great distress; because the summer can do little
more than feed itself, and winter comes with its cold and its scarcity
upon families very slenderly provided.</p>
<h2>CORIATACHAN IN SKY</h2>
<p>The third or fourth day after our arrival at Armidel, brought us
an invitation to the isle of Raasay, which lies east of Sky.&nbsp; It
is incredible how soon the account of any event is propagated in these
narrow countries by the love of talk, which much leisure produces, and
the relief given to the mind in the penury of insular conversation by
a new topick.&nbsp; The arrival of strangers at a place so rarely visited,
excites rumour, and quickens curiosity.&nbsp; I know not whether we
touched at any corner, where Fame had not already prepared us a reception.</p>
<p>To gain a commodious passage to Raasay, it was necessary to pass
over a large part of Sky.&nbsp; We were furnished therefore with horses
and a guide.&nbsp; In the Islands there are no roads, nor any marks
by which a stranger may find his way.&nbsp; The horseman has always
at his side a native of the place, who, by pursuing game, or tending
cattle, or being often employed in messages or conduct, has learned
where the ridge of the hill has breadth sufficient to allow a horse
and his rider a passage, and where the moss or bog is hard enough to
bear them.&nbsp; The bogs are avoided as toilsome at least, if not unsafe,
and therefore the journey is made generally from precipice to precipice;
from which if the eye ventures to look down, it sees below a gloomy
cavity, whence the rush of water is sometimes heard.</p>
<p>But there seems to be in all this more alarm than danger.&nbsp; The
Highlander walks carefully before, and the horse, accustomed to the
ground, follows him with little deviation.&nbsp; Sometimes the hill
is too steep for the horseman to keep his seat, and sometimes the moss
is too tremulous to bear the double weight of horse and man.&nbsp; The
rider then dismounts, and all shift as they can.</p>
<p>Journies made in this manner are rather tedious than long.&nbsp;
A very few miles require several hours.&nbsp; From Armidel we came at
night to Coriatachan, a house very pleasantly situated between two brooks,
with one of the highest hills of the island behind it.&nbsp; It is the
residence of Mr. Mackinnon, by whom we were treated with very liberal
hospitality, among a more numerous and elegant company than it could
have been supposed easy to collect.</p>
<p>The hill behind the house we did not climb.&nbsp; The weather was
rough, and the height and steepness discouraged us.&nbsp; We were told
that there is a cairne upon it.&nbsp; A cairne is a heap of stones thrown
upon the grave of one eminent for dignity of birth, or splendour of
atchievements.&nbsp; It is said that by digging, an urn is always found
under these cairnes: they must therefore have been thus piled by a people
whose custom was to burn the dead.&nbsp; To pile stones is, I believe,
a northern custom, and to burn the body was the Roman practice; nor
do I know when it was that these two acts of sepulture were united.</p>
<p>The weather was next day too violent for the continuation of our
journey; but we had no reason to complain of the interruption.&nbsp;
We saw in every place, what we chiefly desired to know, the manners
of the people.&nbsp; We had company, and, if we had chosen retirement,
we might have had books.</p>
<p>I never was in any house of the Islands, where I did not find books
in more languages than one, if I staid long enough to want them, except
one from which the family was removed.&nbsp; Literature is not neglected
by the higher rank of the Hebridians.</p>
<p>It need not, I suppose, be mentioned, that in countries so little
frequented as the Islands, there are no houses where travellers are
entertained for money.&nbsp; He that wanders about these wilds, either
procures recommendations to those whose habitations lie near his way,
or, when night and weariness come upon him, takes the chance of general
hospitality.&nbsp; If he finds only a cottage, he can expect little
more than shelter; for the cottagers have little more for themselves:
but if his good fortune brings him to the residence of a gentleman,
he will be glad of a storm to prolong his stay.&nbsp; There is, however,
one inn by the sea-side at Sconsor, in Sky, where the post-office is
kept.</p>
<p>At the tables where a stranger is received, neither plenty nor delicacy
is wanting.&nbsp; A tract of land so thinly inhabited, must have much
wild-fowl; and I scarcely remember to have seen a dinner without them.&nbsp;
The moorgame is every where to be had.&nbsp; That the sea abounds with
fish, needs not be told, for it supplies a great part of Europe.&nbsp;
The Isle of Sky has stags and roebucks, but no hares.&nbsp; They sell
very numerous droves of oxen yearly to England, and therefore cannot
be supposed to want beef at home.&nbsp; Sheep and goats are in great
numbers, and they have the common domestick fowls.</p>
<p>But as here is nothing to be bought, every family must kill its own
meat, and roast part of it somewhat sooner than Apicius would prescribe.&nbsp;
Every kind of flesh is undoubtedly excelled by the variety and emulation
of English markets; but that which is not best may be yet very far from
bad, and he that shall complain of his fare in the Hebrides, has improved
his delicacy more than his manhood.</p>
<p>Their fowls are not like those plumped for sale by the poulterers
of London, but they are as good as other places commonly afford, except
that the geese, by feeding in the sea, have universally a fishy rankness.</p>
<p>These geese seem to be of a middle race, between the wild and domestick
kinds.&nbsp; They are so tame as to own a home, and so wild as sometimes
to fly quite away.</p>
<p>Their native bread is made of oats, or barley.&nbsp; Of oatmeal they
spread very thin cakes, coarse and hard, to which unaccustomed palates
are not easily reconciled.&nbsp; The barley cakes are thicker and softer;
I began to eat them without unwillingness; the blackness of their colour
raises some dislike, but the taste is not disagreeable.&nbsp; In most
houses there is wheat flower, with which we were sure to be treated,
if we staid long enough to have it kneaded and baked.&nbsp; As neither
yeast nor leaven are used among them, their bread of every kind is unfermented.&nbsp;
They make only cakes, and never mould a loaf.</p>
<p>A man of the Hebrides, for of the women&rsquo;s diet I can give no
account, as soon as he appears in the morning, swallows a glass of whisky;
yet they are not a drunken race, at least I never was present at much
intemperance; but no man is so abstemious as to refuse the morning dram,
which they call a skalk.</p>
<p>The word whisky signifies water, and is applied by way of eminence
to strong water, or distilled liquor.&nbsp; The spirit drunk in the
North is drawn from barley.&nbsp; I never tasted it, except once for
experiment at the inn in Inverary, when I thought it preferable to any
English malt brandy.&nbsp; It was strong, but not pungent, and was free
from the empyreumatick taste or smell.&nbsp; What was the process I
had no opportunity of inquiring, nor do I wish to improve the art of
making poison pleasant.</p>
<p>Not long after the dram, may be expected the breakfast, a meal in
which the Scots, whether of the lowlands or mountains, must be confessed
to excel us.&nbsp; The tea and coffee are accompanied not only with
butter, but with honey, conserves, and marmalades.&nbsp; If an epicure
could remove by a wish, in quest of sensual gratifications, wherever
he had supped he would breakfast in Scotland.</p>
<p>In the islands however, they do what I found it not very easy to
endure.&nbsp; They pollute the tea-table by plates piled with large
slices of cheshire cheese, which mingles its less grateful odours with
the fragrance of the tea.</p>
<p>Where many questions are to be asked, some will be omitted.&nbsp;
I forgot to inquire how they were supplied with so much exotic luxury.&nbsp;
Perhaps the French may bring them wine for wool, and the Dutch give
them tea and coffee at the fishing season, in exchange for fresh provision.&nbsp;
Their trade is unconstrained; they pay no customs, for there is no officer
to demand them; whatever therefore is made dear only by impost, is obtained
here at an easy rate.</p>
<p>A dinner in the Western Islands differs very little from a dinner
in England, except that in the place of tarts, there are always set
different preparations of milk.&nbsp; This part of their diet will admit
some improvement.&nbsp; Though they have milk, and eggs, and sugar,
few of them know how to compound them in a custard.&nbsp; Their gardens
afford them no great variety, but they have always some vegetables on
the table.&nbsp; Potatoes at least are never wanting, which, though
they have not known them long, are now one of the principal parts of
their food.&nbsp; They are not of the mealy, but the viscous kind.</p>
<p>Their more elaborate cookery, or made dishes, an Englishman at the
first taste is not likely to approve, but the culinary compositions
of every country are often such as become grateful to other nations
only by degrees; though I have read a French author, who, in the elation
of his heart, says, that French cookery pleases all foreigners, but
foreign cookery never satisfies a Frenchman.</p>
<p>Their suppers are, like their dinners, various and plentiful.&nbsp;
The table is always covered with elegant linen.&nbsp; Their plates for
common use are often of that kind of manufacture which is called cream
coloured, or queen&rsquo;s ware.&nbsp; They use silver on all occasions
where it is common in England, nor did I ever find the spoon of horn,
but in one house.</p>
<p>The knives are not often either very bright, or very sharp.&nbsp;
They are indeed instruments of which the Highlanders have not been long
acquainted with the general use.&nbsp; They were not regularly laid
on the table, before the prohibition of arms, and the change of dress.&nbsp;
Thirty years ago the Highlander wore his knife as a companion to his
dirk or dagger, and when the company sat down to meat, the men who had
knives, cut the flesh into small pieces for the women, who with their
fingers conveyed it to their mouths.</p>
<p>There was perhaps never any change of national manners so quick,
so great, and so general, as that which has operated in the Highlands,
by the last conquest, and the subsequent laws.&nbsp; We came thither
too late to see what we expected, a people of peculiar appearance, and
a system of antiquated life.&nbsp; The clans retain little now of their
original character, their ferocity of temper is softened, their military
ardour is extinguished, their dignity of independence is depressed,
their contempt of government subdued, and the reverence for their chiefs
abated.&nbsp; Of what they had before the late conquest of their country,
there remain only their language and their poverty.&nbsp; Their language
is attacked on every side.&nbsp; Schools are erected, in which English
only is taught, and there were lately some who thought it reasonable
to refuse them a version of the holy scriptures, that they might have
no monument of their mother-tongue.</p>
<p>That their poverty is gradually abated, cannot be mentioned among
the unpleasing consequences of subjection.&nbsp; They are now acquainted
with money, and the possibility of gain will by degrees make them industrious.&nbsp;
Such is the effect of the late regulations, that a longer journey than
to the Highlands must be taken by him whose curiosity pants for savage
virtues and barbarous grandeur.</p>
<h2>RAASAY</h2>
<p>At the first intermission of the stormy weather we were informed,
that the boat, which was to convey us to Raasay, attended us on the
coast.&nbsp; We had from this time our intelligence facilitated, and
our conversation enlarged, by the company of Mr. Macqueen, minister
of a parish in Sky, whose knowledge and politeness give him a title
equally to kindness and respect, and who, from this time, never forsook
us till we were preparing to leave Sky, and the adjacent places.</p>
<p>The boat was under the direction of Mr. Malcolm Macleod, a gentleman
of Raasay.&nbsp; The water was calm, and the rowers were vigorous; so
that our passage was quick and pleasant.&nbsp; When we came near the
island, we saw the laird&rsquo;s house, a neat modern fabrick, and found
Mr. Macleod, the proprietor of the Island, with many gentlemen, expecting
us on the beach.&nbsp; We had, as at all other places, some difficulty
in landing.&nbsp; The craggs were irregularly broken, and a false step
would have been very mischievous.</p>
<p>It seemed that the rocks might, with no great labour, have been hewn
almost into a regular flight of steps; and as there are no other landing
places, I considered this rugged ascent as the consequence of a form
of life inured to hardships, and therefore not studious of nice accommodations.&nbsp;
But I know not whether, for many ages, it was not considered as a part
of military policy, to keep the country not easily accessible.&nbsp;
The rocks are natural fortifications, and an enemy climbing with difficulty,
was easily destroyed by those who stood high above him.</p>
<p>Our reception exceeded our expectations.&nbsp; We found nothing but
civility, elegance, and plenty.&nbsp; After the usual refreshments,
and the usual conversation, the evening came upon us.&nbsp; The carpet
was then rolled off the floor; the musician was called, and the whole
company was invited to dance, nor did ever fairies trip with greater
alacrity.&nbsp; The general air of festivity, which predominated in
this place, so far remote from all those regions which the mind has
been used to contemplate as the mansions of pleasure, struck the imagination
with a delightful surprise, analogous to that which is felt at an unexpected
emersion from darkness into light.</p>
<p>When it was time to sup, the dance ceased, and six and thirty persons
sat down to two tables in the same room.&nbsp; After supper the ladies
sung Erse songs, to which I listened as an English audience to an Italian
opera, delighted with the sound of words which I did not understand.</p>
<p>I inquired the subjects of the songs, and was told of one, that it
was a love song, and of another, that it was a farewell composed by
one of the Islanders that was going, in this epidemical fury of emigration,
to seek his fortune in America.&nbsp; What sentiments would arise, on
such an occasion, in the heart of one who had not been taught to lament
by precedent, I should gladly have known; but the lady, by whom I sat,
thought herself not equal to the work of translating.</p>
<p>Mr. Macleod is the proprietor of the islands of Raasay, Rona, and
Fladda, and possesses an extensive district in Sky.&nbsp; The estate
has not, during four hundred years, gained or lost a single acre.&nbsp;
He acknowledges Macleod of Dunvegan as his chief, though his ancestors
have formerly disputed the pre-eminence.</p>
<p>One of the old Highland alliances has continued for two hundred years,
and is still subsisting between Macleod of Raasay and Macdonald of Sky,
in consequence of which, the survivor always inherits the arms of the
deceased; a natural memorial of military friendship.&nbsp; At the death
of the late Sir James Macdonald, his sword was delivered to the present
laird of Raasay.</p>
<p>The family of Raasay consists of the laird, the lady, three sons
and ten daughters.&nbsp; For the sons there is a tutor in the house,
and the lady is said to be very skilful and diligent in the education
of her girls.&nbsp; More gentleness of manners, or a more pleasing appearance
of domestick society, is not found in the most polished countries.</p>
<p>Raasay is the only inhabited island in Mr. Macleod&rsquo;s possession.&nbsp;
Rona and Fladda afford only pasture for cattle, of which one hundred
and sixty winter in Rona, under the superintendence of a solitary herdsman.</p>
<p>The length of Raasay is, by computation, fifteen miles, and the breadth
two.&nbsp; These countries have never been measured, and the computation
by miles is negligent and arbitrary.&nbsp; We observed in travelling,
that the nominal and real distance of places had very little relation
to each other.&nbsp; Raasay probably contains near a hundred square
miles.&nbsp; It affords not much ground, notwithstanding its extent,
either for tillage, or pasture; for it is rough, rocky, and barren.&nbsp;
The cattle often perish by falling from the precipices.&nbsp; It is
like the other islands, I think, generally naked of shade, but it is
naked by neglect; for the laird has an orchard, and very large forest
trees grow about his house.&nbsp; Like other hilly countries it has
many rivulets.&nbsp; One of the brooks turns a corn-mill, and at least
one produces trouts.</p>
<p>In the streams or fresh lakes of the Islands, I have never heard
of any other fish than trouts and eels.&nbsp; The trouts, which I have
seen, are not large; the colour of their flesh is tinged as in England.&nbsp;
Of their eels I can give no account, having never tasted them; for I
believe they are not considered as wholesome food.</p>
<p>It is not very easy to fix the principles upon which mankind have
agreed to eat some animals, and reject others; and as the principle
is not evident, it is not uniform.&nbsp; That which is selected as delicate
in one country, is by its neighbours abhorred as loathsome.&nbsp; The
Neapolitans lately refused to eat potatoes in a famine.&nbsp; An Englishman
is not easily persuaded to dine on snails with an Italian, on frogs
with a Frenchman, or on horseflesh with a Tartar.&nbsp; The vulgar inhabitants
of Sky, I know not whether of the other islands, have not only eels,
but pork and bacon in abhorrence, and accordingly I never saw a hog
in the Hebrides, except one at Dunvegan.</p>
<p>Raasay has wild fowl in abundance, but neither deer, hares, nor rabbits.&nbsp;
Why it has them not, might be asked, but that of such questions there
is no end.&nbsp; Why does any nation want what it might have?&nbsp;
Why are not spices transplanted to America?&nbsp; Why does tea continue
to be brought from China?&nbsp; Life improves but by slow degrees, and
much in every place is yet to do.&nbsp; Attempts have been made to raise
roebucks in Raasay, but without effect.&nbsp; The young ones it is extremely
difficult to rear, and the old can very seldom be taken alive.</p>
<p>Hares and rabbits might be more easily obtained.&nbsp; That they
have few or none of either in Sky, they impute to the ravage of the
foxes, and have therefore set, for some years past, a price upon their
heads, which, as the number was diminished, has been gradually raised,
from three shillings and sixpence to a guinea, a sum so great in this
part of the world, that, in a short time, Sky may be as free from foxes,
as England from wolves.&nbsp; The fund for these rewards is a tax of
sixpence in the pound, imposed by the farmers on themselves, and said
to be paid with great willingness.</p>
<p>The beasts of prey in the Islands are foxes, otters, and weasels.&nbsp;
The foxes are bigger than those of England; but the otters exceed ours
in a far greater proportion.&nbsp; I saw one at Armidel, of a size much
beyond that which I supposed them ever to attain; and Mr. Maclean, the
heir of Col, a man of middle stature, informed me that he once shot
an otter, of which the tail reached the ground, when he held up the
head to a level with his own.&nbsp; I expected the otter to have a foot
particularly formed for the art of swimming; but upon examination, I
did not find it differing much from that of a spaniel.&nbsp; As he preys
in the sea, he does little visible mischief, and is killed only for
his fur.&nbsp; White otters are sometimes seen.</p>
<p>In Raasay they might have hares and rabbits, for they have no foxes.&nbsp;
Some depredations, such as were never made before, have caused a suspicion
that a fox has been lately landed in the Island by spite or wantonness.&nbsp;
This imaginary stranger has never yet been seen, and therefore, perhaps,
the mischief was done by some other animal.&nbsp; It is not likely that
a creature so ungentle, whose head could have been sold in Sky for a
guinea, should be kept alive only to gratify the malice of sending him
to prey upon a neighbour: and the passage from Sky is wider than a fox
would venture to swim, unless he were chased by dogs into the sea, and
perhaps than his strength would enable him to cross.&nbsp; How beasts
of prey came into any islands is not easy to guess.&nbsp; In cold countries
they take advantage of hard winters, and travel over the ice: but this
is a very scanty solution; for they are found where they have no discoverable
means of coming.</p>
<p>The corn of this island is but little.&nbsp; I saw the harvest of
a small field.&nbsp; The women reaped the Corn, and the men bound up
the sheaves.&nbsp; The strokes of the sickle were timed by the modulation
of the harvest song, in which all their voices were united.&nbsp; They
accompany in the Highlands every action, which can be done in equal
time, with an appropriated strain, which has, they say, not much meaning;
but its effects are regularity and cheerfulness.&nbsp; The ancient proceleusmatick
song, by which the rowers of gallies were animated, may be supposed
to have been of this kind.&nbsp; There is now an oar-song used by the
Hebridians.</p>
<p>The ground of Raasay seems fitter for cattle than for corn, and of
black cattle I suppose the number is very great.&nbsp; The Laird himself
keeps a herd of four hundred, one hundred of which are annually sold.&nbsp;
Of an extensive domain, which he holds in his own hands, he considers
the sale of cattle as repaying him the rent, and supports the plenty
of a very liberal table with the remaining product.</p>
<p>Raasay is supposed to have been very long inhabited.&nbsp; On one
side of it they show caves, into which the rude nations of the first
ages retreated from the weather.&nbsp; These dreary vaults might have
had other uses.&nbsp; There is still a cavity near the house called
the oar-cave, in which the seamen, after one of those piratical expeditions,
which in rougher times were very frequent, used, as tradition tells,
to hide their oars.&nbsp; This hollow was near the sea, that nothing
so necessary might be far to be fetched; and it was secret, that enemies,
if they landed, could find nothing.&nbsp; Yet it is not very evident
of what use it was to hide their oars from those, who, if they were
masters of the coast, could take away their boats.</p>
<p>A proof much stronger of the distance at which the first possessors
of this island lived from the present time, is afforded by the stone
heads of arrows which are very frequently picked up.&nbsp; The people
call them Elf-bolts, and believe that the fairies shoot them at the
cattle.&nbsp; They nearly resemble those which Mr. Banks has lately
brought from the savage countries in the Pacifick Ocean, and must have
been made by a nation to which the use of metals was unknown.</p>
<p>The number of this little community has never been counted by its
ruler, nor have I obtained any positive account, consistent with the
result of political computation.&nbsp; Not many years ago, the late
Laird led out one hundred men upon a military expedition.&nbsp; The
sixth part of a people is supposed capable of bearing arms: Raasay had
therefore six hundred inhabitants.&nbsp; But because it is not likely,
that every man able to serve in the field would follow the summons,
or that the chief would leave his lands totally defenceless, or take
away all the hands qualified for labour, let it be supposed, that half
as many might be permitted to stay at home.&nbsp; The whole number will
then be nine hundred, or nine to a square mile; a degree of populousness
greater than those tracts of desolation can often show.&nbsp; They are
content with their country, and faithful to their chiefs, and yet uninfected
with the fever of migration.</p>
<p>Near the house, at Raasay, is a chapel unroofed and ruinous, which
has long been used only as a place of burial.&nbsp; About the churches,
in the Islands, are small squares inclosed with stone, which belong
to particular families, as repositories for the dead.&nbsp; At Raasay
there is one, I think, for the proprietor, and one for some collateral
house.</p>
<p>It is told by Martin, that at the death of the Lady of the Island,
it has been here the custom to erect a cross.&nbsp; This we found not
to be true.&nbsp; The stones that stand about the chapel at a small
distance, some of which perhaps have crosses cut upon them, are believed
to have been not funeral monuments, but the ancient boundaries of the
sanctuary or consecrated ground.</p>
<p>Martin was a man not illiterate: he was an inhabitant of Sky, and
therefore was within reach of intelligence, and with no great difficulty
might have visited the places which he undertakes to describe; yet with
all his opportunities, he has often suffered himself to be deceived.&nbsp;
He lived in the last century, when the chiefs of the clans had lost
little of their original influence.&nbsp; The mountains were yet unpenetrated,
no inlet was opened to foreign novelties, and the feudal institution
operated upon life with their full force.&nbsp; He might therefore have
displayed a series of subordination and a form of government, which,
in more luminous and improved regions, have been long forgotten, and
have delighted his readers with many uncouth customs that are now disused,
and wild opinions that prevail no longer.&nbsp; But he probably had
not knowledge of the world sufficient to qualify him for judging what
would deserve or gain the attention of mankind.&nbsp; The mode of life
which was familiar to himself, he did not suppose unknown to others,
nor imagined that he could give pleasure by telling that of which it
was, in his little country, impossible to be ignorant.</p>
<p>What he has neglected cannot now be performed.&nbsp; In nations,
where there is hardly the use of letters, what is once out of sight
is lost for ever.&nbsp; They think but little, and of their few thoughts,
none are wasted on the past, in which they are neither interested by
fear nor hope.&nbsp; Their only registers are stated observances and
practical representations.&nbsp; For this reason an age of ignorance
is an age of ceremony.&nbsp; Pageants, and processions, and commemorations,
gradually shrink away, as better methods come into use of recording
events, and preserving rights.</p>
<p>It is not only in Raasay that the chapel is unroofed and useless;
through the few islands which we visited, we neither saw nor heard of
any house of prayer, except in Sky, that was not in ruins.&nbsp; The
malignant influence of Calvinism has blasted ceremony and decency together;
and if the remembrance of papal superstition is obliterated, the monuments
of papal piety are likewise effaced.</p>
<p>It has been, for many years, popular to talk of the lazy devotion
of the Romish clergy; over the sleepy laziness of men that erected churches,
we may indulge our superiority with a new triumph, by comparing it with
the fervid activity of those who suffer them to fall.</p>
<p>Of the destruction of churches, the decay of religion must in time
be the consequence; for while the publick acts of the ministry are now
performed in houses, a very small number can be present; and as the
greater part of the Islanders make no use of books, all must necessarily
live in total ignorance who want the opportunity of vocal instruction.</p>
<p>From these remains of ancient sanctity, which are every where to
be found, it has been conjectured, that, for the last two centuries,
the inhabitants of the Islands have decreased in number.&nbsp; This
argument, which supposes that the churches have been suffered to fall,
only because they were no longer necessary, would have some force, if
the houses of worship still remaining were sufficient for the people.&nbsp;
But since they have now no churches at all, these venerable fragments
do not prove the people of former times to have been more numerous,
but to have been more devout.&nbsp; If the inhabitants were doubled
with their present principles, it appears not that any provision for
publick worship would be made.&nbsp; Where the religion of a country
enforces consecrated buildings, the number of those buildings may be
supposed to afford some indication, however uncertain, of the populousness
of the place; but where by a change of manners a nation is contented
to live without them, their decay implies no diminution of inhabitants.</p>
<p>Some of these dilapidations are said to be found in islands now uninhabited;
but I doubt whether we can thence infer that they were ever peopled.&nbsp;
The religion of the middle age, is well known to have placed too much
hope in lonely austerities.&nbsp; Voluntary solitude was the great act
of propitiation, by which crimes were effaced, and conscience was appeased;
it is therefore not unlikely, that oratories were often built in places
where retirement was sure to have no disturbance.</p>
<p>Raasay has little that can detain a traveller, except the Laird and
his family; but their power wants no auxiliaries.&nbsp; Such a seat
of hospitality, amidst the winds and waters, fills the imagination with
a delightful contrariety of images.&nbsp; Without is the rough ocean
and the rocky land, the beating billows and the howling storm: within
is plenty and elegance, beauty and gaiety, the song and the dance.&nbsp;
In Raasay, if I could have found an Ulysses, I had fancied a Phoeacia.</p>
<h2>DUNVEGAN</h2>
<p>At Raasay, by good fortune, Macleod, so the chief of the clan is
called, was paying a visit, and by him we were invited to his seat at
Dunvegan.&nbsp; Raasay has a stout boat, built in Norway, in which,
with six oars, he conveyed us back to Sky.&nbsp; We landed at Port Re,
so called, because James the Fifth of Scotland, who had curiosity to
visit the Islands, came into it.&nbsp; The port is made by an inlet
of the sea, deep and narrow, where a ship lay waiting to dispeople Sky,
by carrying the natives away to America.</p>
<p>In coasting Sky, we passed by the cavern in which it was the custom,
as Martin relates, to catch birds in the night, by making a fire at
the entrance.&nbsp; This practice is disused; for the birds, as is known
often to happen, have changed their haunts.</p>
<p>Here we dined at a publick house, I believe the only inn of the island,
and having mounted our horses, travelled in the manner already described,
till we came to Kingsborough, a place distinguished by that name, because
the King lodged here when he landed at Port Re.&nbsp; We were entertained
with the usual hospitality by Mr. Macdonald and his lady, Flora Macdonald,
a name that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity
be virtues, mentioned with honour.&nbsp; She is a woman of middle stature,
soft features, gentle manners, and elegant presence.</p>
<p>In the morning we sent our horses round a promontory to meet us,
and spared ourselves part of the day&rsquo;s fatigue, by crossing an
arm of the sea.&nbsp; We had at last some difficulty in coming to Dunvegan;
for our way led over an extensive moor, where every step was to be taken
with caution, and we were often obliged to alight, because the ground
could not be trusted.&nbsp; In travelling this watery flat, I perceived
that it had a visible declivity, and might without much expence or difficulty
be drained.&nbsp; But difficulty and expence are relative terms, which
have different meanings in different places.</p>
<p>To Dunvegan we came, very willing to be at rest, and found our fatigue
amply recompensed by our reception.&nbsp; Lady Macleod, who had lived
many years in England, was newly come hither with her son and four daughters,
who knew all the arts of southern elegance, and all the modes of English
economy.&nbsp; Here therefore we settled, and did not spoil the present
hour with thoughts of departure.</p>
<p>Dunvegan is a rocky prominence, that juts out into a bay, on the
west side of Sky.&nbsp; The house, which is the principal seat of Macleod,
is partly old and partly modern; it is built upon the rock, and looks
upon the water.&nbsp; It forms two sides of a small square: on the third
side is the skeleton of a castle of unknown antiquity, supposed to have
been a Norwegian fortress, when the Danes were masters of the Islands.&nbsp;
It is so nearly entire, that it might have easily been made habitable,
were there not an ominous tradition in the family, that the owner shall
not long outlive the reparation.&nbsp; The grandfather of the present
Laird, in defiance of prediction, began the work, but desisted in a
little time, and applied his money to worse uses.</p>
<p>As the inhabitants of the Hebrides lived, for many ages, in continual
expectation of hostilities, the chief of every clan resided in a fortress.&nbsp;
This house was accessible only from the water, till the last possessor
opened an entrance by stairs upon the land.</p>
<p>They had formerly reason to be afraid, not only of declared wars
and authorized invaders, or of roving pirates, which, in the northern
seas, must have been very common; but of inroads and insults from rival
clans, who, in the plenitude of feudal independence, asked no leave
of their Sovereign to make war on one another.&nbsp; Sky has been ravaged
by a feud between the two mighty powers of Macdonald and Macleod.&nbsp;
Macdonald having married a Macleod upon some discontent dismissed her,
perhaps because she had brought him no children.&nbsp; Before the reign
of James the Fifth, a Highland Laird made a trial of his wife for a
certain time, and if she did not please him, he was then at liberty
to send her away.&nbsp; This however must always have offended, and
Macleod resenting the injury, whatever were its circumstances, declared,
that the wedding had been solemnized without a bonfire, but that the
separation should be better illuminated; and raising a little army,
set fire to the territories of Macdonald, who returned the visit, and
prevailed.</p>
<p>Another story may show the disorderly state of insular neighbourhood.&nbsp;
The inhabitants of the Isle of Egg, meeting a boat manned by Macleods,
tied the crew hand and foot, and set them a-drift.&nbsp; Macleod landed
upon Egg, and demanded the offenders; but the inhabitants refusing to
surrender them, retreated to a cavern, into which they thought their
enemies unlikely to follow them.&nbsp; Macleod choked them with smoke,
and left them lying dead by families as they stood.</p>
<p>Here the violence of the weather confined us for some time, not at
all to our discontent or inconvenience.&nbsp; We would indeed very willingly
have visited the Islands, which might be seen from the house scattered
in the sea, and I was particularly desirous to have viewed Isay; but
the storms did not permit us to launch a boat, and we were condemned
to listen in idleness to the wind, except when we were better engaged
by listening to the ladies.</p>
<p>We had here more wind than waves, and suffered the severity of a
tempest, without enjoying its magnificence.&nbsp; The sea being broken
by the multitude of islands, does not roar with so much noise, nor beat
the shore with such foamy violence, as I have remarked on the coast
of Sussex.&nbsp; Though, while I was in the Hebrides, the wind was extremely
turbulent, I never saw very high billows.</p>
<p>The country about Dunvegan is rough and barren.&nbsp; There are no
trees, except in the orchard, which is a low sheltered spot surrounded
with a wall.</p>
<p>When this house was intended to sustain a siege, a well was made
in the court, by boring the rock downwards, till water was found, which
though so near to the sea, I have not heard mentioned as brackish, though
it has some hardness, or other qualities, which make it less fit for
use; and the family is now better supplied from a stream, which runs
by the rock, from two pleasing waterfalls.</p>
<p>Here we saw some traces of former manners, and heard some standing
traditions.&nbsp; In the house is kept an ox&rsquo;s horn, hollowed
so as to hold perhaps two quarts, which the heir of Macleod was expected
to swallow at one draught, as a test of his manhood, before he was permitted
to bear arms, or could claim a seat among the men.&nbsp; It is held
that the return of the Laird to Dunvegan, after any considerable absence,
produces a plentiful capture of herrings; and that, if any woman crosses
the water to the opposite Island, the herrings will desert the coast.&nbsp;
Boetius tells the same of some other place.&nbsp; This tradition is
not uniform.&nbsp; Some hold that no woman may pass, and others that
none may pass but a Macleod.</p>
<p>Among other guests, which the hospitality of Dunvegan brought to
the table, a visit was paid by the Laird and Lady of a small island
south of Sky, of which the proper name is Muack, which signifies swine.&nbsp;
It is commonly called Muck, which the proprietor not liking, has endeavoured,
without effect, to change to Monk.&nbsp; It is usual to call gentlemen
in Scotland by the name of their possessions, as Raasay, Bernera, Loch
Buy, a practice necessary in countries inhabited by clans, where all
that live in the same territory have one name, and must be therefore
discriminated by some addition.&nbsp; This gentleman, whose name, I
think, is Maclean, should be regularly called Muck; but the appellation,
which he thinks too coarse for his Island, he would like still less
for himself, and he is therefore addressed by the title of, Isle of
Muck.</p>
<p>This little Island, however it be named, is of considerable value.&nbsp;
It is two English miles long, and three quarters of a mile broad, and
consequently contains only nine hundred and sixty English acres.&nbsp;
It is chiefly arable.&nbsp; Half of this little dominion the Laird retains
in his own hand, and on the other half, live one hundred and sixty persons,
who pay their rent by exported corn.&nbsp; What rent they pay, we were
not told, and could not decently inquire.&nbsp; The proportion of the
people to the land is such, as the most fertile countries do not commonly
maintain.</p>
<p>The Laird having all his people under his immediate view, seems to
be very attentive to their happiness.&nbsp; The devastation of the small-pox,
when it visits places where it comes seldom, is well known.&nbsp; He
has disarmed it of its terrour at Muack, by inoculating eighty of his
people.&nbsp; The expence was two shillings and sixpence a head.&nbsp;
Many trades they cannot have among them, but upon occasion, he fetches
a smith from the Isle of Egg, and has a tailor from the main land, six
times a year.&nbsp; This island well deserved to be seen, but the Laird&rsquo;s
absence left us no opportunity.</p>
<p>Every inhabited island has its appendant and subordinate islets.&nbsp;
Muck, however small, has yet others smaller about it, one of which has
only ground sufficient to afford pasture for three wethers.</p>
<p>At Dunvegan I had tasted lotus, and was in danger of forgetting that
I was ever to depart, till Mr. Boswell sagely reproached me with my
sluggishness and softness.&nbsp; I had no very forcible defence to make;
and we agreed to pursue our journey.&nbsp; Macleod accompanied us to
Ulinish, where we were entertained by the sheriff of the Island.</p>
<h2>ULINISH</h2>
<p>Mr. Macqueen travelled with us, and directed our attention to all
that was worthy of observation.&nbsp; With him we went to see an ancient
building, called a dun or borough.&nbsp; It was a circular inclosure,
about forty-two feet in diameter, walled round with loose stones, perhaps
to the height of nine feet.&nbsp; The walls were very thick, diminishing
a little toward the top, and though in these countries, stone is not
brought far, must have been raised with much labour.&nbsp; Within the
great circle were several smaller rounds of wall, which formed distinct
apartments.&nbsp; Its date, and its use are unknown.&nbsp; Some suppose
it the original seat of the chiefs of the Macleods.&nbsp; Mr. Macqueen
thought it a Danish fort.</p>
<p>The entrance is covered with flat stones, and is narrow, because
it was necessary that the stones which lie over it, should reach from
one wall to the other; yet, strait as the passage is, they seem heavier
than could have been placed where they now lie, by the naked strength
of as many men as might stand about them.&nbsp; They were probably raised
by putting long pieces of wood under them, to which the action of a
long line of lifters might be applied.&nbsp; Savages, in all countries,
have patience proportionate to their unskilfulness, and are content
to attain their end by very tedious methods.</p>
<p>If it was ever roofed, it might once have been a dwelling, but as
there is no provision for water, it could not have been a fortress.&nbsp;
In Sky, as in every other place, there is an ambition of exalting whatever
has survived memory, to some important use, and referring it to very
remote ages.&nbsp; I am inclined to suspect, that in lawless times,
when the inhabitants of every mountain stole the cattle of their neighbour,
these inclosures were used to secure the herds and flocks in the night.&nbsp;
When they were driven within the wall, they might be easily watched,
and defended as long as could be needful; for the robbers durst not
wait till the injured clan should find them in the morning.</p>
<p>The interior inclosures, if the whole building were once a house,
were the chambers of the chief inhabitants.&nbsp; If it was a place
of security for cattle, they were probably the shelters of the keepers.</p>
<p>From the Dun we were conducted to another place of security, a cave
carried a great way under ground, which had been discovered by digging
after a fox.&nbsp; These caves, of which many have been found, and many
probably remain concealed, are formed, I believe, commonly by taking
advantage of a hollow, where banks or rocks rise on either side.&nbsp;
If no such place can be found, the ground must be cut away.&nbsp; The
walls are made by piling stones against the earth, on either side.&nbsp;
It is then roofed by larger stones laid across the cavern, which therefore
cannot be wide.&nbsp; Over the roof, turfs were placed, and grass was
suffered to grow; and the mouth was concealed by bushes, or some other
cover.</p>
<p>These caves were represented to us as the cabins of the first rude
inhabitants, of which, however, I am by no means persuaded.&nbsp; This
was so low, that no man could stand upright in it.&nbsp; By their construction
they are all so narrow, that two can never pass along them together,
and being subterraneous, they must be always damp.&nbsp; They are not
the work of an age much ruder than the present; for they are formed
with as much art as the construction of a common hut requires.&nbsp;
I imagine them to have been places only of occasional use, in which
the Islander, upon a sudden alarm, hid his utensils, or his cloaths,
and perhaps sometimes his wife and children.</p>
<p>This cave we entered, but could not proceed the whole length, and
went away without knowing how far it was carried.&nbsp; For this omission
we shall be blamed, as we perhaps have blamed other travellers; but
the day was rainy, and the ground was damp.&nbsp; We had with us neither
spades nor pickaxes, and if love of ease surmounted our desire of knowledge,
the offence has not the invidiousness of singularity.</p>
<p>Edifices, either standing or ruined, are the chief records of an
illiterate nation.&nbsp; In some part of this journey, at no great distance
from our way, stood a shattered fortress, of which the learned minister,
to whose communication we are much indebted, gave us an account.</p>
<p>Those, said he, are the walls of a place of refuge, built in the
time of James the Sixth, by Hugh Macdonald, who was next heir to the
dignity and fortune of his chief.&nbsp; Hugh, being so near his wish,
was impatient of delay; and had art and influence sufficient to engage
several gentlemen in a plot against the Laird&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Something
must be stipulated on both sides; for they would not dip their hands
in blood merely for Hugh&rsquo;s advancement.&nbsp; The compact was
formerly written, signed by the conspirators, and placed in the hands
of one Macleod.</p>
<p>It happened that Macleod had sold some cattle to a drover, who, not
having ready money, gave him a bond for payment.&nbsp; The debt was
discharged, and the bond re-demanded; which Macleod, who could not read,
intending to put into his hands, gave him the conspiracy.&nbsp; The
drover, when he had read the paper, delivered it privately to Macdonald;
who, being thus informed of his danger, called his friends together,
and provided for his safety.&nbsp; He made a public feast, and inviting
Hugh Macdonald and his confederates, placed each of them at the table
between two men of known fidelity.&nbsp; The compact of conspiracy was
then shewn, and every man confronted with his own name.&nbsp; Macdonald
acted with great moderation.&nbsp; He upbraided Hugh, both with disloyalty
and ingratitude; but told the rest, that he considered them as men deluded
and misinformed.&nbsp; Hugh was sworn to fidelity, and dismissed with
his companions; but he was not generous enough to be reclaimed by lenity;
and finding no longer any countenance among the gentlemen, endeavoured
to execute the same design by meaner hands.&nbsp; In this practice he
was detected, taken to Macdonald&rsquo;s castle, and imprisoned in the
dungeon.&nbsp; When he was hungry, they let down a plentiful meal of
salted meat; and when, after his repast, he called for drink, conveyed
to him a covered cup, which, when he lifted the lid, he found empty.&nbsp;
From that time they visited him no more, but left him to perish in solitude
and darkness.</p>
<p>We were then told of a cavern by the sea-side, remarkable for the
powerful reverberation of sounds.&nbsp; After dinner we took a boat,
to explore this curious cavity.&nbsp; The boatmen, who seemed to be
of a rank above that of common drudges, inquired who the strangers were,
and being told we came one from Scotland, and the other from England,
asked if the Englishman could recount a long genealogy.&nbsp; What answer
was given them, the conversation being in Erse, I was not much inclined
to examine.</p>
<p>They expected no good event of the voyage; for one of them declared
that he heard the cry of an English ghost.&nbsp; This omen I was not
told till after our return, and therefore cannot claim the dignity of
despising it.</p>
<p>The sea was smooth.&nbsp; We never left the shore, and came without
any disaster to the cavern, which we found rugged and misshapen, about
one hundred and eighty feet long, thirty wide in the broadest part,
and in the loftiest, as we guessed, about thirty high.&nbsp; It was
now dry, but at high water the sea rises in it near six feet.&nbsp;
Here I saw what I had never seen before, limpets and mussels in their
natural state.&nbsp; But, as a new testimony to the veracity of common
fame, here was no echo to be heard.</p>
<p>We then walked through a natural arch in the rock, which might have
pleased us by its novelty, had the stones, which incumbered our feet,
given us leisure to consider it.&nbsp; We were shown the gummy seed
of the kelp, that fastens itself to a stone, from which it grows into
a strong stalk.</p>
<p>In our return, we found a little boy upon the point of rock, catching
with his angle, a supper for the family.&nbsp; We rowed up to him, and
borrowed his rod, with which Mr. Boswell caught a cuddy.</p>
<p>The cuddy is a fish of which I know not the philosophical name.&nbsp;
It is not much bigger than a gudgeon, but is of great use in these Islands,
as it affords the lower people both food, and oil for their lamps.&nbsp;
Cuddies are so abundant, at sometimes of the year, that they are caught
like whitebait in the Thames, only by dipping a basket and drawing it
back.</p>
<p>If it were always practicable to fish, these Islands could never
be in much danger from famine; but unhappily in the winter, when other
provision fails, the seas are commonly too rough for nets, or boats.</p>
<h2>TALISKER IN SKY</h2>
<p>From Ulinish, our next stage was to Talisker, the house of colonel
Macleod, an officer in the Dutch service, who, in this time of universal
peace, has for several years been permitted to be absent from his regiment.&nbsp;
Having been bred to physick, he is consequently a scholar, and his lady,
by accompanying him in his different places of residence, is become
skilful in several languages.&nbsp; Talisker is the place beyond all
that I have seen, from which the gay and the jovial seem utterly excluded;
and where the hermit might expect to grow old in meditation, without
possibility of disturbance or interruption.&nbsp; It is situated very
near the sea, but upon a coast where no vessel lands but when it is
driven by a tempest on the rocks.&nbsp; Towards the land are lofty hills
streaming with waterfalls.&nbsp; The garden is sheltered by firs or
pines, which grow there so prosperously, that some, which the present
inhabitant planted, are very high and thick.</p>
<p>At this place we very happily met Mr. Donald Maclean, a young gentleman,
the eldest son of the Laird of Col, heir to a very great extent of land,
and so desirous of improving his inheritance, that he spent a considerable
time among the farmers of Hertfordshire, and Hampshire, to learn their
practice.&nbsp; He worked with his own hands at the principal operations
of agriculture, that he might not deceive himself by a false opinion
of skill, which, if he should find it deficient at home, he had no means
of completing.&nbsp; If the world has agreed to praise the travels and
manual labours of the Czar of Muscovy, let Col have his share of the
like applause, in the proportion of his dominions to the empire of Russia.</p>
<p>This young gentleman was sporting in the mountains of Sky, and when
he was weary with following his game, repaired for lodging to Talisker.&nbsp;
At night he missed one of his dogs, and when he went to seek him in
the morning, found two eagles feeding on his carcass.</p>
<p>Col, for he must be named by his possessions, hearing that our intention
was to visit Jona, offered to conduct us to his chief, Sir Allan Maclean,
who lived in the isle of Inch Kenneth, and would readily find us a convenient
passage.&nbsp; From this time was formed an acquaintance, which being
begun by kindness, was accidentally continued by constraint; we derived
much pleasure from it, and I hope have given him no reason to repent
it.</p>
<p>The weather was now almost one continued storm, and we were to snatch
some happy intermission to be conveyed to Mull, the third Island of
the Hebrides, lying about a degree south of Sky, whence we might easily
find our way to Inch Kenneth, where Sir Allan Maclean resided, and afterward
to Jona.</p>
<p>For this purpose, the most commodious station that we could take
was Armidel, which Sir Alexander Macdonald had now left to a gentleman,
who lived there as his factor or steward.</p>
<p>In our way to Armidel was Coriatachan, where we had already been,
and to which therefore we were very willing to return.&nbsp; We staid
however so long at Talisker, that a great part of our journey was performed
in the gloom of the evening.&nbsp; In travelling even thus almost without
light thro&rsquo; naked solitude, when there is a guide whose conduct
may be trusted, a mind not naturally too much disposed to fear, may
preserve some degree of cheerfulness; but what must be the solicitude
of him who should be wandering, among the craggs and hollows, benighted,
ignorant, and alone?</p>
<p>The fictions of the Gothick romances were not so remote from credibility
as they are now thought.&nbsp; In the full prevalence of the feudal
institution, when violence desolated the world, and every baron lived
in a fortress, forests and castles were regularly succeeded by each
other, and the adventurer might very suddenly pass from the gloom of
woods, or the ruggedness of moors, to seats of plenty, gaiety, and magnificence.&nbsp;
Whatever is imaged in the wildest tale, if giants, dragons, and enchantment
be excepted, would be felt by him, who, wandering in the mountains without
a guide, or upon the sea without a pilot, should be carried amidst his
terror and uncertainty, to the hospitality and elegance of Raasay or
Dunvegan.</p>
<p>To Coriatachan at last we came, and found ourselves welcomed as before.&nbsp;
Here we staid two days, and made such inquiries as curiosity suggested.&nbsp;
The house was filled with company, among whom Mr. Macpherson and his
sister distinguished themselves by their politeness and accomplishments.&nbsp;
By him we were invited to Ostig, a house not far from Armidel, where
we might easily hear of a boat, when the weather would suffer us to
leave the Island.</p>
<h2>OSTIG IN SKY</h2>
<p>At Ostig, of which Mr. Macpherson is minister, we were entertained
for some days, then removed to Armidel, where we finished our observations
on the island of Sky.</p>
<p>As this Island lies in the fifty-seventh degree, the air cannot be
supposed to have much warmth.&nbsp; The long continuance of the sun
above the horizon, does indeed sometimes produce great heat in northern
latitudes; but this can only happen in sheltered places, where the atmosphere
is to a certain degree stagnant, and the same mass of air continues
to receive for many hours the rays of the sun, and the vapours of the
earth.&nbsp; Sky lies open on the west and north to a vast extent of
ocean, and is cooled in the summer by perpetual ventilation, but by
the same blasts is kept warm in winter.&nbsp; Their weather is not pleasing.&nbsp;
Half the year is deluged with rain.&nbsp; From the autumnal to the vernal
equinox, a dry day is hardly known, except when the showers are suspended
by a tempest.&nbsp; Under such skies can be expected no great exuberance
of vegetation.&nbsp; Their winter overtakes their summer, and their
harvest lies upon the ground drenched with rain.&nbsp; The autumn struggles
hard to produce some of our early fruits.&nbsp; I gathered gooseberries
in September; but they were small, and the husk was thick.</p>
<p>Their winter is seldom such as puts a full stop to the growth of
plants, or reduces the cattle to live wholly on the surplusage of the
summer.&nbsp; In the year Seventy-one they had a severe season, remembered
by the name of the Black Spring, from which the island has not yet recovered.&nbsp;
The snow lay long upon the ground, a calamity hardly known before.&nbsp;
Part of their cattle died for want, part were unseasonably sold to buy
sustenance for the owners; and, what I have not read or heard of before,
the kine that survived were so emaciated and dispirited, that they did
not require the male at the usual time.&nbsp; Many of the roebucks perished.</p>
<p>The soil, as in other countries, has its diversities.&nbsp; In some
parts there is only a thin layer of earth spread upon a rock, which
bears nothing but short brown heath, and perhaps is not generally capable
of any better product.&nbsp; There are many bogs or mosses of greater
or less extent, where the soil cannot be supposed to want depth, though
it is too wet for the plow.&nbsp; But we did not observe in these any
aquatick plants.&nbsp; The vallies and the mountains are alike darkened
with heath.&nbsp; Some grass, however, grows here and there, and some
happier spots of earth are capable of tillage.</p>
<p>Their agriculture is laborious, and perhaps rather feeble than unskilful.&nbsp;
Their chief manure is seaweed, which, when they lay it to rot upon the
field, gives them a better crop than those of the Highlands.&nbsp; They
heap sea shells upon the dunghill, which in time moulder into a fertilising
substance.&nbsp; When they find a vein of earth where they cannot use
it, they dig it up, and add it to the mould of a more commodious place.</p>
<p>Their corn grounds often lie in such intricacies among the craggs,
that there is no room for the action of a team and plow.&nbsp; The soil
is then turned up by manual labour, with an instrument called a crooked
spade, of a form and weight which to me appeared very incommodious,
and would perhaps be soon improved in a country where workmen could
be easily found and easily paid.&nbsp; It has a narrow blade of iron
fixed to a long and heavy piece of wood, which must have, about a foot
and a half above the iron, a knee or flexure with the angle downwards.&nbsp;
When the farmer encounters a stone which is the great impediment of
his operations, he drives the blade under it, and bringing the knee
or angle to the ground, has in the long handle a very forcible lever.</p>
<p>According to the different mode of tillage, farms are distinguished
into long land and short land.&nbsp; Long land is that which affords
room for a plow, and short land is turned up by the spade.</p>
<p>The grain which they commit to the furrows thus tediously formed,
is either oats or barley.&nbsp; They do not sow barley without very
copious manure, and then they expect from it ten for one, an increase
equal to that of better countries; but the culture is so operose that
they content themselves commonly with oats; and who can relate without
compassion, that after all their diligence they are to expect only a
triple increase?&nbsp; It is in vain to hope for plenty, when a third
part of the harvest must be reserved for seed.</p>
<p>When their grain is arrived at the state which they must consider
as ripeness, they do not cut, but pull the barley: to the oats they
apply the sickle.&nbsp; Wheel carriages they have none, but make a frame
of timber, which is drawn by one horse with the two points behind pressing
on the ground.&nbsp; On this they sometimes drag home their sheaves,
but often convey them home in a kind of open panier, or frame of sticks
upon the horse&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Of that which is obtained with so much difficulty, nothing surely
ought to be wasted; yet their method of clearing their oats from the
husk is by parching them in the straw.&nbsp; Thus with the genuine improvidence
of savages, they destroy that fodder for want of which their cattle
may perish.&nbsp; From this practice they have two petty conveniences.&nbsp;
They dry the grain so that it is easily reduced to meal, and they escape
the theft of the thresher.&nbsp; The taste contracted from the fire
by the oats, as by every other scorched substance, use must long ago
have made grateful.&nbsp; The oats that are not parched must be dried
in a kiln.</p>
<p>The barns of Sky I never saw.&nbsp; That which Macleod of Raasay
had erected near his house was so contrived, because the harvest is
seldom brought home dry, as by perpetual perflation to prevent the mow
from heating.</p>
<p>Of their gardens I can judge only from their tables.&nbsp; I did
not observe that the common greens were wanting, and suppose, that by
choosing an advantageous exposition, they can raise all the more hardy
esculent plants.&nbsp; Of vegetable fragrance or beauty they are not
yet studious.&nbsp; Few vows are made to Flora in the Hebrides.</p>
<p>They gather a little hay, but the grass is mown late; and is so often
almost dry and again very wet, before it is housed, that it becomes
a collection of withered stalks without taste or fragrance; it must
be eaten by cattle that have nothing else, but by most English farmers
would be thrown away.</p>
<p>In the Islands I have not heard that any subterraneous treasures
have been discovered, though where there are mountains, there are commonly
minerals.&nbsp; One of the rocks in Col has a black vein, imagined to
consist of the ore of lead; but it was never yet opened or essayed.&nbsp;
In Sky a black mass was accidentally picked up, and brought into the
house of the owner of the land, who found himself strongly inclined
to think it a coal, but unhappily it did not burn in the chimney.&nbsp;
Common ores would be here of no great value; for what requires to be
separated by fire, must, if it were found, be carried away in its mineral
state, here being no fewel for the smelting-house or forge.&nbsp; Perhaps
by diligent search in this world of stone, some valuable species of
marble might be discovered.&nbsp; But neither philosophical curiosity,
nor commercial industry, have yet fixed their abode here, where the
importunity of immediate want supplied but for the day, and craving
on the morrow, has left little room for excursive knowledge or the pleasing
fancies of distant profit.</p>
<p>They have lately found a manufacture considerably lucrative.&nbsp;
Their rocks abound with kelp, a sea-plant, of which the ashes are melted
into glass.&nbsp; They burn kelp in great quantities, and then send
it away in ships, which come regularly to purchase them.&nbsp; This
new source of riches has raised the rents of many maritime farms; but
the tenants pay, like all other tenants, the additional rent with great
unwillingness; because they consider the profits of the kelp as the
mere product of personal labour, to which the landlord contributes nothing.&nbsp;
However, as any man may be said to give, what he gives the power of
gaining, he has certainly as much right to profit from the price of
kelp as of any thing else found or raised upon his ground.</p>
<p>This new trade has excited a long and eager litigation between Macdonald
and Macleod, for a ledge of rocks, which, till the value of kelp was
known, neither of them desired the reputation of possessing.</p>
<p>The cattle of Sky are not so small as is commonly believed.&nbsp;
Since they have sent their beeves in great numbers to southern marts,
they have probably taken more care of their breed.&nbsp; At stated times
the annual growth of cattle is driven to a fair, by a general drover,
and with the money, which he returns to the farmer, the rents are paid.</p>
<p>The price regularly expected, is from two to three pounds a head:
there was once one sold for five pounds.&nbsp; They go from the Islands
very lean, and are not offered to the butcher, till they have been long
fatted in English pastures.</p>
<p>Of their black cattle, some are without horns, called by the Scots
humble cows, as we call a bee an humble bee, that wants a sting.&nbsp;
Whether this difference be specifick, or accidental, though we inquired
with great diligence, we could not be informed.&nbsp; We are not very
sure that the bull is ever without horns, though we have been told,
that such bulls there are.&nbsp; What is produced by putting a horned
and unhorned male and female together, no man has ever tried, that thought
the result worthy of observation.</p>
<p>Their horses are, like their cows, of a moderate size.&nbsp; I had
no difficulty to mount myself commodiously by the favour of the gentlemen.&nbsp;
I heard of very little cows in Barra, and very little horses in Rum,
where perhaps no care is taken to prevent that diminution of size, which
must always happen, where the greater and the less copulate promiscuously,
and the young animal is restrained from growth by penury of sustenance.</p>
<p>The goat is the general inhabitant of the earth, complying with every
difference of climate, and of soil.&nbsp; The goats of the Hebrides
are like others: nor did I hear any thing of their sheep, to be particularly
remarked.</p>
<p>In the penury of these malignant regions, nothing is left that can
be converted to food.&nbsp; The goats and the sheep are milked like
the cows.&nbsp; A single meal of a goat is a quart, and of a sheep a
pint.&nbsp; Such at least was the account, which I could extract from
those of whom I am not sure that they ever had inquired.</p>
<p>The milk of goats is much thinner than that of cows, and that of
sheep is much thicker.&nbsp; Sheeps milk is never eaten before it is
boiled: as it is thick, it must be very liberal of curd, and the people
of St. Kilda form it into small cheeses.</p>
<p>The stags of the mountains are less than those of our parks, or forests,
perhaps not bigger than our fallow deer.&nbsp; Their flesh has no rankness,
nor is inferiour in flavour to our common venison.&nbsp; The roebuck
I neither saw nor tasted.&nbsp; These are not countries for a regular
chase.&nbsp; The deer are not driven with horns and hounds.&nbsp; A
sportsman, with his gun in his hand, watches the animal, and when he
has wounded him, traces him by the blood.</p>
<p>They have a race of brinded greyhounds, larger and stronger than
those with which we course hares, and those are the only dogs used by
them for the chase.</p>
<p>Man is by the use of fire-arms made so much an overmatch for other
animals, that in all countries, where they are in use, the wild part
of the creation sensibly diminishes.&nbsp; There will probably not be
long, either stags or roebucks in the Islands.&nbsp; All the beasts
of chase would have been lost long ago in countries well inhabited,
had they not been preserved by laws for the pleasure of the rich.</p>
<p>There are in Sky neither rats nor mice, but the weasel is so frequent,
that he is heard in houses rattling behind chests or beds, as rats in
England.&nbsp; They probably owe to his predominance that they have
no other vermin; for since the great rat took possession of this part
of the world, scarce a ship can touch at any port, but some of his race
are left behind.&nbsp; They have within these few years began to infest
the isle of Col, where being left by some trading vessel, they have
increased for want of weasels to oppose them.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Sky, and of the other Islands, which I have seen,
are commonly of the middle stature, with fewer among them very tall
or very short, than are seen in England, or perhaps, as their numbers
are small, the chances of any deviation from the common measure are
necessarily few.&nbsp; The tallest men that I saw are among those of
higher rank.&nbsp; In regions of barrenness and scarcity, the human
race is hindered in its growth by the same causes as other animals.</p>
<p>The ladies have as much beauty here as in other places, but bloom
and softness are not to be expected among the lower classes, whose faces
are exposed to the rudeness of the climate, and whose features are sometimes
contracted by want, and sometimes hardened by the blasts.&nbsp; Supreme
beauty is seldom found in cottages or work-shops, even where no real
hardships are suffered.&nbsp; To expand the human face to its full perfection,
it seems necessary that the mind should co-operate by placidness of
content, or consciousness of superiority.</p>
<p>Their strength is proportionate to their size, but they are accustomed
to run upon rough ground, and therefore can with great agility skip
over the bog, or clamber the mountain.&nbsp; For a campaign in the wastes
of America, soldiers better qualified could not have been found.&nbsp;
Having little work to do, they are not willing, nor perhaps able to
endure a long continuance of manual labour, and are therefore considered
as habitually idle.</p>
<p>Having never been supplied with those accommodations, which life
extensively diversified with trades affords, they supply their wants
by very insufficient shifts, and endure many inconveniences, which a
little attention would easily relieve.&nbsp; I have seen a horse carrying
home the harvest on a crate.&nbsp; Under his tail was a stick for a
crupper, held at the two ends by twists of straw.&nbsp; Hemp will grow
in their islands, and therefore ropes may be had.&nbsp; If they wanted
hemp, they might make better cordage of rushes, or perhaps of nettles,
than of straw.</p>
<p>Their method of life neither secures them perpetual health, nor exposes
them to any particular diseases.&nbsp; There are physicians in the Islands,
who, I believe, all practise chirurgery, and all compound their own
medicines.</p>
<p>It is generally supposed, that life is longer in places where there
are few opportunities of luxury; but I found no instance here of extraordinary
longevity.&nbsp; A cottager grows old over his oaten cakes, like a citizen
at a turtle feast.&nbsp; He is indeed seldom incommoded by corpulence.&nbsp;
Poverty preserves him from sinking under the burden of himself, but
he escapes no other injury of time.&nbsp; Instances of long life are
often related, which those who hear them are more willing to credit
than examine.&nbsp; To be told that any man has attained a hundred years,
gives hope and comfort to him who stands trembling on the brink of his
own climacterick.</p>
<p>Length of life is distributed impartially to very different modes
of life in very different climates; and the mountains have no greater
examples of age and health than the low lands, where I was introduced
to two ladies of high quality; one of whom, in her ninety-fourth year,
presided at her table with the full exercise of all her powers; and
the other has attained her eighty-fourth, without any diminution of
her vivacity, and with little reason to accuse time of depredations
on her beauty.</p>
<p>In the Islands, as in most other places, the inhabitants are of different
rank, and one does not encroach here upon another.&nbsp; Where there
is no commerce nor manufacture, he that is born poor can scarcely become
rich; and if none are able to buy estates, he that is born to land cannot
annihilate his family by selling it.&nbsp; This was once the state of
these countries.&nbsp; Perhaps there is no example, till within a century
and half, of any family whose estate was alienated otherwise than by
violence or forfeiture.&nbsp; Since money has been brought amongst them,
they have found, like others, the art of spending more than they receive;
and I saw with grief the chief of a very ancient clan, whose Island
was condemned by law to be sold for the satisfaction of his creditors.</p>
<p>The name of highest dignity is Laird, of which there are in the extensive
Isle of Sky only three, Macdonald, Macleod, and Mackinnon.&nbsp; The
Laird is the original owner of the land, whose natural power must be
very great, where no man lives but by agriculture; and where the produce
of the land is not conveyed through the labyrinths of traffick, but
passes directly from the hand that gathers it to the mouth that eats
it.&nbsp; The Laird has all those in his power that live upon his farms.&nbsp;
Kings can, for the most part, only exalt or degrade.&nbsp; The Laird
at pleasure can feed or starve, can give bread, or withold it.&nbsp;
This inherent power was yet strengthened by the kindness of consanguinity,
and the reverence of patriarchal authority.&nbsp; The Laird was the
father of the Clan, and his tenants commonly bore his name.&nbsp; And
to these principles of original command was added, for many ages, an
exclusive right of legal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This multifarious, and extensive obligation operated with force scarcely
credible.&nbsp; Every duty, moral or political, was absorbed in affection
and adherence to the Chief.&nbsp; Not many years have passed since the
clans knew no law but the Laird&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; He told them to
whom they should be friends or enemies, what King they should obey,
and what religion they should profess.</p>
<p>When the Scots first rose in arms against the succession of the house
of Hanover, Lovat, the Chief of the Frasers, was in exile for a rape.&nbsp;
The Frasers were very numerous, and very zealous against the government.&nbsp;
A pardon was sent to Lovat.&nbsp; He came to the English camp, and the
clan immediately deserted to him.</p>
<p>Next in dignity to the Laird is the Tacksman; a large taker or lease-holder
of land, of which he keeps part, as a domain, in his own hand, and lets
part to under tenants.&nbsp; The Tacksman is necessarily a man capable
of securing to the Laird the whole rent, and is commonly a collateral
relation.&nbsp; These tacks, or subordinate possessions, were long considered
as hereditary, and the occupant was distinguished by the name of the
place at which he resided.&nbsp; He held a middle station, by which
the highest and the lowest orders were connected.&nbsp; He paid rent
and reverence to the Laird, and received them from the tenants.&nbsp;
This tenure still subsists, with its original operation, but not with
the primitive stability.&nbsp; Since the islanders, no longer content
to live, have learned the desire of growing rich, an ancient dependent
is in danger of giving way to a higher bidder, at the expense of domestick
dignity and hereditary power.&nbsp; The stranger, whose money buys him
preference, considers himself as paying for all that he has, and is
indifferent about the Laird&rsquo;s honour or safety.&nbsp; The commodiousness
of money is indeed great; but there are some advantages which money
cannot buy, and which therefore no wise man will by the love of money
be tempted to forego.</p>
<p>I have found in the hither parts of Scotland, men not defective in
judgment or general experience, who consider the Tacksman as a useless
burden of the ground, as a drone who lives upon the product of an estate,
without the right of property, or the merit of labour, and who impoverishes
at once the landlord and the tenant.&nbsp; The land, say they, is let
to the Tacksman at sixpence an acre, and by him to the tenant at ten-pence.&nbsp;
Let the owner be the immediate landlord to all the tenants; if he sets
the ground at eight-pence, he will increase his revenue by a fourth
part, and the tenant&rsquo;s burthen will be diminished by a fifth.</p>
<p>Those who pursue this train of reasoning, seem not sufficiently to
inquire whither it will lead them, nor to know that it will equally
shew the propriety of suppressing all wholesale trade, of shutting up
the shops of every man who sells what he does not make, and of extruding
all whose agency and profit intervene between the manufacturer and the
consumer.&nbsp; They may, by stretching their understandings a little
wider, comprehend, that all those who by undertaking large quantities
of manufacture, and affording employment to many labourers, make themselves
considered as benefactors to the publick, have only been robbing their
workmen with one hand, and their customers with the other.&nbsp; If
Crowley had sold only what he could make, and all his smiths had wrought
their own iron with their own hammers, he would have lived on less,
and they would have sold their work for more.&nbsp; The salaries of
superintendents and clerks would have been partly saved, and partly
shared, and nails been sometimes cheaper by a farthing in a hundred.&nbsp;
But then if the smith could not have found an immediate purchaser, he
must have deserted his anvil; if there had by accident at any time been
more sellers than buyers, the workmen must have reduced their profit
to nothing, by underselling one another; and as no great stock could
have been in any hand, no sudden demand of large quantities could have
been answered and the builder must have stood still till the nailer
could supply him.</p>
<p>According to these schemes, universal plenty is to begin and end
in universal misery.&nbsp; Hope and emulation will be utterly extinguished;
and as all must obey the call of immediate necessity, nothing that requires
extensive views, or provides for distant consequences will ever be performed.</p>
<p>To the southern inhabitants of Scotland, the state of the mountains
and the islands is equally unknown with that of Borneo or Sumatra: Of
both they have only heard a little, and guess the rest.&nbsp; They are
strangers to the language and the manners, to the advantages and wants
of the people, whose life they would model, and whose evils they would
remedy.</p>
<p>Nothing is less difficult than to procure one convenience by the
forfeiture of another.&nbsp; A soldier may expedite his march by throwing
away his arms.&nbsp; To banish the Tacksman is easy, to make a country
plentiful by diminishing the people, is an expeditious mode of husbandry;
but little abundance, which there is nobody to enjoy, contributes little
to human happiness.</p>
<p>As the mind must govern the hands, so in every society the man of
intelligence must direct the man of labour.&nbsp; If the Tacksmen be
taken away, the Hebrides must in their present state be given up to
grossness and ignorance; the tenant, for want of instruction, will be
unskilful, and for want of admonition will be negligent.&nbsp; The Laird
in these wide estates, which often consist of islands remote from one
another, cannot extend his personal influence to all his tenants; and
the steward having no dignity annexed to his character, can have little
authority among men taught to pay reverence only to birth, and who regard
the Tacksman as their hereditary superior; nor can the steward have
equal zeal for the prosperity of an estate profitable only to the Laird,
with the Tacksman, who has the Laird&rsquo;s income involved in his
own.</p>
<p>The only gentlemen in the Islands are the Lairds, the Tacksmen, and
the Ministers, who frequently improve their livings by becoming farmers.&nbsp;
If the Tacksmen be banished, who will be left to impart knowledge, or
impress civility?&nbsp; The Laird must always be at a distance from
the greater part of his lands; and if he resides at all upon them, must
drag his days in solitude, having no longer either a friend or a companion;
he will therefore depart to some more comfortable residence, and leave
the tenants to the wisdom and mercy of a factor.</p>
<p>Of tenants there are different orders, as they have greater or less
stock.&nbsp; Land is sometimes leased to a small fellowship, who live
in a cluster of huts, called a Tenants Town, and are bound jointly and
separately for the payment of their rent.&nbsp; These, I believe, employ
in the care of their cattle, and the labour of tillage, a kind of tenants
yet lower; who having a hut with grass for a certain number of cows
and sheep, pay their rent by a stipulated quantity of labour.</p>
<p>The condition of domestick servants, or the price of occasional labour,
I do not know with certainty.&nbsp; I was told that the maids have sheep,
and are allowed to spin for their own clothing; perhaps they have no
pecuniary wages, or none but in very wealthy families.&nbsp; The state
of life, which has hitherto been purely pastoral, begins now to be a
little variegated with commerce; but novelties enter by degrees, and
till one mode has fully prevailed over the other, no settled notion
can be formed.</p>
<p>Such is the system of insular subordination, which, having little
variety, cannot afford much delight in the view, nor long detain the
mind in contemplation.&nbsp; The inhabitants were for a long time perhaps
not unhappy; but their content was a muddy mixture of pride and ignorance,
an indifference for pleasures which they did not know, a blind veneration
for their chiefs, and a strong conviction of their own importance.</p>
<p>Their pride has been crushed by the heavy hand of a vindictive conqueror,
whose seventies have been followed by laws, which, though they cannot
be called cruel, have produced much discontent, because they operate
upon the surface of life, and make every eye bear witness to subjection.&nbsp;
To be compelled to a new dress has always been found painful.</p>
<p>Their Chiefs being now deprived of their jurisdiction, have already
lost much of their influence; and as they gradually degenerate from
patriarchal rulers to rapacious landlords, they will divest themselves
of the little that remains.</p>
<p>That dignity which they derived from an opinion of their military
importance, the law, which disarmed them, has abated.&nbsp; An old gentleman,
delighting himself with the recollection of better days, related, that
forty years ago, a Chieftain walked out attended by ten or twelve followers,
with their arms rattling.&nbsp; That animating rabble has now ceased.&nbsp;
The Chief has lost his formidable retinue; and the Highlander walks
his heath unarmed and defenceless, with the peaceable submission of
a French peasant or English cottager.</p>
<p>Their ignorance grows every day less, but their knowledge is yet
of little other use than to shew them their wants.&nbsp; They are now
in the period of education, and feel the uneasiness of discipline, without
yet perceiving the benefit of instruction.</p>
<p>The last law, by which the Highlanders are deprived of their arms,
has operated with efficacy beyond expectation.&nbsp; Of former statutes
made with the same design, the execution had been feeble, and the effect
inconsiderable.&nbsp; Concealment was undoubtedly practised, and perhaps
often with connivance.&nbsp; There was tenderness, or partiality, on
one side, and obstinacy on the other.&nbsp; But the law, which followed
the victory of Culloden, found the whole nation dejected and intimidated;
informations were given without danger, and without fear, and the arms
were collected with such rigour, that every house was despoiled of its
defence.</p>
<p>To disarm part of the Highlands, could give no reasonable occasion
of complaint.&nbsp; Every government must be allowed the power of taking
away the weapon that is lifted against it.&nbsp; But the loyal clans
murmured, with some appearance of justice, that after having defended
the King, they were forbidden for the future to defend themselves; and
that the sword should be forfeited, which had been legally employed.&nbsp;
Their case is undoubtedly hard, but in political regulations, good cannot
be complete, it can only be predominant.</p>
<p>Whether by disarming a people thus broken into several tribes, and
thus remote from the seat of power, more good than evil has been produced,
may deserve inquiry.&nbsp; The supreme power in every community has
the right of debarring every individual, and every subordinate society
from self-defence, only because the supreme power is able to defend
them; and therefore where the governor cannot act, he must trust the
subject to act for himself.&nbsp; These Islands might be wasted with
fire and sword before their sovereign would know their distress.&nbsp;
A gang of robbers, such as has been lately found confederating themselves
in the Highlands, might lay a wide region under contribution.&nbsp;
The crew of a petty privateer might land on the largest and most wealthy
of the Islands, and riot without control in cruelty and waste.&nbsp;
It was observed by one of the Chiefs of Sky, that fifty armed men might,
without resistance ravage the country.&nbsp; Laws that place the subjects
in such a state, contravene the first principles of the compact of authority:
they exact obedience, and yield no protection.</p>
<p>It affords a generous and manly pleasure to conceive a little nation
gathering its fruits and tending its herds with fearless confidence,
though it lies open on every side to invasion, where, in contempt of
walls and trenches, every man sleeps securely with his sword beside
him; where all on the first approach of hostility came together at the
call to battle, as at a summons to a festal show; and committing their
cattle to the care of those whom age or nature has disabled, engage
the enemy with that competition for hazard and for glory, which operate
in men that fight under the eye of those, whose dislike or kindness
they have always considered as the greatest evil or the greatest good.</p>
<p>This was, in the beginning of the present century, the state of the
Highlands.&nbsp; Every man was a soldier, who partook of national confidence,
and interested himself in national honour.&nbsp; To lose this spirit,
is to lose what no small advantage will compensate.</p>
<p>It may likewise deserve to be inquired, whether a great nation ought
to be totally commercial? whether amidst the uncertainty of human affairs,
too much attention to one mode of happiness may not endanger others?
whether the pride of riches must not sometimes have recourse to the
protection of courage? and whether, if it be necessary to preserve in
some part of the empire the military spirit, it can subsist more commodiously
in any place, than in remote and unprofitable provinces, where it can
commonly do little harm, and whence it may be called forth at any sudden
exigence?</p>
<p>It must however be confessed, that a man, who places honour only
in successful violence, is a very troublesome and pernicious animal
in time of peace; and that the martial character cannot prevail in a
whole people, but by the diminution of all other virtues.&nbsp; He that
is accustomed to resolve all right into conquest, will have very little
tenderness or equity.&nbsp; All the friendship in such a life can be
only a confederacy of invasion, or alliance of defence.&nbsp; The strong
must flourish by force, and the weak subsist by stratagem.</p>
<p>Till the Highlanders lost their ferocity, with their arms, they suffered
from each other all that malignity could dictate, or precipitance could
act.&nbsp; Every provocation was revenged with blood, and no man that
ventured into a numerous company, by whatever occasion brought together,
was sure of returning without a wound.&nbsp; If they are now exposed
to foreign hostilities, they may talk of the danger, but can seldom
feel it.&nbsp; If they are no longer martial, they are no longer quarrelsome.&nbsp;
Misery is caused for the most part, not by a heavy crush of disaster,
but by the corrosion of less visible evils, which canker enjoyment,
and undermine security.&nbsp; The visit of an invader is necessarily
rare, but domestick animosities allow no cessation.</p>
<p>The abolition of the local jurisdictions, which had for so many ages
been exercised by the chiefs, has likewise its evil and its good.&nbsp;
The feudal constitution naturally diffused itself into long ramifications
of subordinate authority.&nbsp; To this general temper of the government
was added the peculiar form of the country, broken by mountains into
many subdivisions scarcely accessible but to the natives, and guarded
by passes, or perplexed with intricacies, through which national justice
could not find its way.</p>
<p>The power of deciding controversies, and of punishing offences, as
some such power there must always be, was intrusted to the Lairds of
the country, to those whom the people considered as their natural judges.&nbsp;
It cannot be supposed that a rugged proprietor of the rocks, unprincipled
and unenlightened, was a nice resolver of entangled claims, or very
exact in proportioning punishment to offences.&nbsp; But the more he
indulged his own will, the more he held his vassals in dependence.&nbsp;
Prudence and innocence, without the favour of the Chief, conferred no
security; and crimes involved no danger, when the judge was resolute
to acquit.</p>
<p>When the chiefs were men of knowledge and virtue, the convenience
of a domestick judicature was great.&nbsp; No long journies were necessary,
nor artificial delays could be practised; the character, the alliances,
and interests of the litigants were known to the court, and all false
pretences were easily detected.&nbsp; The sentence, when it was past,
could not be evaded; the power of the Laird superseded formalities,
and justice could not be defeated by interest or stratagem.</p>
<p>I doubt not but that since the regular judges have made their circuits
through the whole country, right has been every where more wisely, and
more equally distributed; the complaint is, that litigation is grown
troublesome, and that the magistrates are too few, and therefore often
too remote for general convenience.</p>
<p>Many of the smaller Islands have no legal officer within them.&nbsp;
I once asked, If a crime should be committed, by what authority the
offender could be seized? and was told, that the Laird would exert his
right; a right which he must now usurp, but which surely necessity must
vindicate, and which is therefore yet exercised in lower degrees, by
some of the proprietors, when legal processes cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>In all greater questions, however, there is now happily an end to
all fear or hope from malice or from favour.&nbsp; The roads are secure
in those places through which, forty years ago, no traveller could pass
without a convoy.&nbsp; All trials of right by the sword are forgotten,
and the mean are in as little danger from the powerful as in other places.&nbsp;
No scheme of policy has, in any country, yet brought the rich and poor
on equal terms into courts of judicature.&nbsp; Perhaps experience,
improving on experience, may in time effect it.</p>
<p>Those who have long enjoyed dignity and power, ought not to lose
it without some equivalent.&nbsp; There was paid to the Chiefs by the
publick, in exchange for their privileges, perhaps a sum greater than
most of them had ever possessed, which excited a thirst for riches,
of which it shewed them the use.&nbsp; When the power of birth and station
ceases, no hope remains but from the prevalence of money.&nbsp; Power
and wealth supply the place of each other.&nbsp; Power confers the ability
of gratifying our desire without the consent of others.&nbsp; Wealth
enables us to obtain the consent of others to our gratification.&nbsp;
Power, simply considered, whatever it confers on one, must take from
another.&nbsp; Wealth enables its owner to give to others, by taking
only from himself.&nbsp; Power pleases the violent and proud: wealth
delights the placid and the timorous.&nbsp; Youth therefore flies at
power, and age grovels after riches.</p>
<p>The Chiefs, divested of their prerogatives, necessarily turned their
thoughts to the improvement of their revenues, and expect more rent,
as they have less homage.&nbsp; The tenant, who is far from perceiving
that his condition is made better in the same proportion, as that of
his landlord is made worse, does not immediately see why his industry
is to be taxed more heavily than before.&nbsp; He refuses to pay the
demand, and is ejected; the ground is then let to a stranger, who perhaps
brings a larger stock, but who, taking the land at its full price, treats
with the Laird upon equal terms, and considers him not as a Chief, but
as a trafficker in land.&nbsp; Thus the estate perhaps is improved,
but the clan is broken.</p>
<p>It seems to be the general opinion, that the rents have been raised
with too much eagerness.&nbsp; Some regard must be paid to prejudice.&nbsp;
Those who have hitherto paid but little, will not suddenly be persuaded
to pay much, though they can afford it.&nbsp; As ground is gradually
improved, and the value of money decreases, the rent may be raised without
any diminution of the farmer&rsquo;s profits: yet it is necessary in
these countries, where the ejection of a tenant is a greater evil, than
in more populous places, to consider not merely what the land will produce,
but with what ability the inhabitant can cultivate it.&nbsp; A certain
stock can allow but a certain payment; for if the land be doubled, and
the stock remains the same, the tenant becomes no richer.&nbsp; The
proprietors of the Highlands might perhaps often increase their income,
by subdividing the farms, and allotting to every occupier only so many
acres as he can profitably employ, but that they want people.</p>
<p>There seems now, whatever be the cause, to be through a great part
of the Highlands a general discontent.&nbsp; That adherence, which was
lately professed by every man to the chief of his name, has now little
prevalence; and he that cannot live as he desires at home, listens to
the tale of fortunate islands, and happy regions, where every man may
have land of his own, and eat the product of his labour without a superior.</p>
<p>Those who have obtained grants of American lands, have, as is well
known, invited settlers from all quarters of the globe; and among other
places, where oppression might produce a wish for new habitations, their
emissaries would not fail to try their persuasions in the Isles of Scotland,
where at the time when the clans were newly disunited from their Chiefs,
and exasperated by unprecedented exactions, it is no wonder that they
prevailed.</p>
<p>Whether the mischiefs of emigration were immediately perceived, may
be justly questioned.&nbsp; They who went first, were probably such
as could best be spared; but the accounts sent by the earliest adventurers,
whether true or false, inclined many to follow them; and whole neighbourhoods
formed parties for removal; so that departure from their native country
is no longer exile.&nbsp; He that goes thus accompanied, carries with
him all that makes life pleasant.&nbsp; He sits down in a better climate,
surrounded by his kindred and his friends: they carry with them their
language, their opinions, their popular songs, and hereditary merriment:
they change nothing but the place of their abode; and of that change
they perceive the benefit.</p>
<p>This is the real effect of emigration, if those that go away together
settle on the same spot, and preserve their ancient union.&nbsp; But
some relate that these adventurous visitants of unknown regions, after
a voyage passed in dreams of plenty and felicity, are dispersed at last
upon a Sylvan wilderness, where their first years must be spent in toil,
to clear the ground which is afterwards to be tilled, and that the whole
effect of their undertakings is only more fatigue and equal scarcity.</p>
<p>Both accounts may be suspected.&nbsp; Those who are gone will endeavour
by every art to draw others after them; for as their numbers are greater,
they will provide better for themselves.&nbsp; When Nova Scotia was
first peopled, I remember a letter, published under the character of
a New Planter, who related how much the climate put him in mind of Italy.&nbsp;
Such intelligence the Hebridians probably receive from their transmarine
correspondents.&nbsp; But with equal temptations of interest, and perhaps
with no greater niceness of veracity, the owners of the Islands spread
stories of American hardships to keep their people content at home.</p>
<p>Some method to stop this epidemick desire of wandering, which spreads
its contagion from valley to valley, deserves to be sought with great
diligence.&nbsp; In more fruitful countries, the removal of one only
makes room for the succession of another: but in the Hebrides, the loss
of an inhabitant leaves a lasting vacuity; for nobody born in any other
parts of the world will choose this country for his residence, and an
Island once depopulated will remain a desert, as long as the present
facility of travel gives every one, who is discontented and unsettled,
the choice of his abode.</p>
<p>Let it be inquired, whether the first intention of those who are
fluttering on the wing, and collecting a flock that they may take their
flight, be to attain good, or to avoid evil.&nbsp; If they are dissatisfied
with that part of the globe, which their birth has allotted them, and
resolve not to live without the pleasures of happier climates; if they
long for bright suns, and calm skies, and flowery fields, and fragrant
gardens, I know not by what eloquence they can be persuaded, or by what
offers they can be hired to stay.</p>
<p>But if they are driven from their native country by positive evils,
and disgusted by ill-treatment, real or imaginary, it were fit to remove
their grievances, and quiet their resentment; since, if they have been
hitherto undutiful subjects, they will not much mend their principles
by American conversation.</p>
<p>To allure them into the army, it was thought proper to indulge them
in the continuance of their national dress.&nbsp; If this concession
could have any effect, it might easily be made.&nbsp; That dissimilitude
of appearance, which was supposed to keep them distinct from the rest
of the nation, might disincline them from coalescing with the Pensylvanians,
or people of Connecticut.&nbsp; If the restitution of their arms will
reconcile them to their country, let them have again those weapons,
which will not be more mischievous at home than in the Colonies.&nbsp;
That they may not fly from the increase of rent, I know not whether
the general good does not require that the landlords be, for a time,
restrained in their demands, and kept quiet by pensions proportionate
to their loss.</p>
<p>To hinder insurrection, by driving away the people, and to govern
peaceably, by having no subjects, is an expedient that argues no great
profundity of politicks.&nbsp; To soften the obdurate, to convince the
mistaken, to mollify the resentful, are worthy of a statesman; but it
affords a legislator little self-applause to consider, that where there
was formerly an insurrection, there is now a wilderness.</p>
<p>It has been a question often agitated without solution, why those
northern regions are now so thinly peopled, which formerly overwhelmed
with their armies the Roman empire.&nbsp; The question supposes what
I believe is not true, that they had once more inhabitants than they
could maintain, and overflowed only because they were full.</p>
<p>This is to estimate the manners of all countries and ages by our
own.&nbsp; Migration, while the state of life was unsettled, and there
was little communication of intelligence between distant places, was
among the wilder nations of Europe, capricious and casual.&nbsp; An
adventurous projector heard of a fertile coast unoccupied, and led out
a colony; a chief of renown for bravery, called the young men together,
and led them out to try what fortune would present.&nbsp; When C&aelig;sar
was in Gaul, he found the Helvetians preparing to go they knew not whither,
and put a stop to their motions.&nbsp; They settled again in their own
country, where they were so far from wanting room, that they had accumulated
three years provision for their march.</p>
<p>The religion of the North was military; if they could not find enemies,
it was their duty to make them: they travelled in quest of danger, and
willingly took the chance of Empire or Death.&nbsp; If their troops
were numerous, the countries from which they were collected are of vast
extent, and without much exuberance of people great armies may be raised
where every man is a soldier.&nbsp; But their true numbers were never
known.&nbsp; Those who were conquered by them are their historians,
and shame may have excited them to say, that they were overwhelmed with
multitudes.&nbsp; To count is a modern practice, the ancient method
was to guess; and when numbers are guessed they are always magnified.</p>
<p>Thus England has for several years been filled with the atchievements
of seventy thousand Highlanders employed in America.&nbsp; I have heard
from an English officer, not much inclined to favour them, that their
behaviour deserved a very high degree of military praise; but their
number has been much exaggerated.&nbsp; One of the ministers told me,
that seventy thousand men could not have been found in all the Highlands,
and that more than twelve thousand never took the field.&nbsp; Those
that went to the American war, went to destruction.&nbsp; Of the old
Highland regiment, consisting of twelve hundred, only seventy-six survived
to see their country again.</p>
<p>The Gothick swarms have at least been multiplied with equal liberality.&nbsp;
That they bore no great proportion to the inhabitants, in whose countries
they settled, is plain from the paucity of northern words now found
in the provincial languages.&nbsp; Their country was not deserted for
want of room, because it was covered with forests of vast extent; and
the first effect of plenitude of inhabitants is the destruction of wood.&nbsp;
As the Europeans spread over America the lands are gradually laid naked.</p>
<p>I would not be understood to say, that necessity had never any part
in their expeditions.&nbsp; A nation, whose agriculture is scanty or
unskilful, may be driven out by famine.&nbsp; A nation of hunters may
have exhausted their game.&nbsp; I only affirm that the northern regions
were not, when their irruptions subdued the Romans, overpeopled with
regard to their real extent of territory, and power of fertility.&nbsp;
In a country fully inhabited, however afterward laid waste, evident
marks will remain of its former populousness.&nbsp; But of Scandinavia
and Germany, nothing is known but that as we trace their state upwards
into antiquity, their woods were greater, and their cultivated ground
was less.</p>
<p>That causes were different from want of room may produce a general
disposition to seek another country is apparent from the present conduct
of the Highlanders, who are in some places ready to threaten a total
secession.&nbsp; The numbers which have already gone, though like other
numbers they may be magnified, are very great, and such as if they had
gone together and agreed upon any certain settlement, might have founded
an independent government in the depths of the western continent.&nbsp;
Nor are they only the lowest and most indigent; many men of considerable
wealth have taken with them their train of labourers and dependants;
and if they continue the feudal scheme of polity, may establish new
clans in the other hemisphere.</p>
<p>That the immediate motives of their desertion must be imputed to
their landlords, may be reasonably concluded, because some Lairds of
more prudence and less rapacity have kept their vassals undiminished.&nbsp;
From Raasa only one man had been seduced, and at Col there was no wish
to go away.</p>
<p>The traveller who comes hither from more opulent countries, to speculate
upon the remains of pastoral life, will not much wonder that a common
Highlander has no strong adherence to his native soil; for of animal
enjoyments, or of physical good, he leaves nothing that he may not find
again wheresoever he may be thrown.</p>
<p>The habitations of men in the Hebrides may be distinguished into
huts and houses.&nbsp; By a house, I mean a building with one story
over another; by a hut, a dwelling with only one floor.&nbsp; The Laird,
who formerly lived in a castle, now lives in a house; sometimes sufficiently
neat, but seldom very spacious or splendid.&nbsp; The Tacksmen and the
Ministers have commonly houses.&nbsp; Wherever there is a house, the
stranger finds a welcome, and to the other evils of exterminating Tacksmen
may be added the unavoidable cessation of hospitality, or the devolution
of too heavy a burden on the Ministers.</p>
<p>Of the houses little can be said.&nbsp; They are small, and by the
necessity of accumulating stores, where there are so few opportunities
of purchase, the rooms are very heterogeneously filled.&nbsp; With want
of cleanliness it were ingratitude to reproach them.&nbsp; The servants
having been bred upon the naked earth, think every floor clean, and
the quick succession of guests, perhaps not always over-elegant, does
not allow much time for adjusting their apartments.</p>
<p>Huts are of many gradations; from murky dens, to commodious dwellings.</p>
<p>The wall of a common hut is always built without mortar, by a skilful
adaptation of loose stones.&nbsp; Sometimes perhaps a double wall of
stones is raised, and the intermediate space filled with earth.&nbsp;
The air is thus completely excluded.&nbsp; Some walls are, I think,
formed of turfs, held together by a wattle, or texture of twigs.&nbsp;
Of the meanest huts, the first room is lighted by the entrance, and
the second by the smoke hole.&nbsp; The fire is usually made in the
middle.&nbsp; But there are huts, or dwellings of only one story, inhabited
by gentlemen, which have walls cemented with mortar, glass windows,
and boarded floors.&nbsp; Of these all have chimneys, and some chimneys
have grates.</p>
<p>The house and the furniture are not always nicely suited.&nbsp; We
were driven once, by missing a passage, to the hut of a gentleman, where,
after a very liberal supper, when I was conducted to my chamber, I found
an elegant bed of Indian cotton, spread with fine sheets.&nbsp; The
accommodation was flattering; I undressed myself, and felt my feet in
the mire.&nbsp; The bed stood upon the bare earth, which a long course
of rain had softened to a puddle.</p>
<p>In pastoral countries the condition of the lowest rank of people
is sufficiently wretched.&nbsp; Among manufacturers, men that have no
property may have art and industry, which make them necessary, and therefore
valuable.&nbsp; But where flocks and corn are the only wealth, there
are always more hands than work, and of that work there is little in
which skill and dexterity can be much distinguished.&nbsp; He therefore
who is born poor never can be rich.&nbsp; The son merely occupies the
place of the father, and life knows nothing of progression or advancement.</p>
<p>The petty tenants, and labouring peasants, live in miserable cabins,
which afford them little more than shelter from the storms.&nbsp; The
Boor of Norway is said to make all his own utensils.&nbsp; In the Hebrides,
whatever might be their ingenuity, the want of wood leaves them no materials.&nbsp;
They are probably content with such accommodations as stones of different
forms and sizes can afford them.</p>
<p>Their food is not better than their lodging.&nbsp; They seldom taste
the flesh of land animals; for here are no markets.&nbsp; What each
man eats is from his own stock.&nbsp; The great effect of money is to
break property into small parts.&nbsp; In towns, he that has a shilling
may have a piece of meat; but where there is no commerce, no man can
eat mutton but by killing a sheep.</p>
<p>Fish in fair weather they need not want; but, I believe, man never
lives long on fish, but by constraint; he will rather feed upon roots
and berries.</p>
<p>The only fewel of the Islands is peat.&nbsp; Their wood is all consumed,
and coal they have not yet found.&nbsp; Peat is dug out of the marshes,
from the depth of one foot to that of six.&nbsp; That is accounted the
best which is nearest the surface.&nbsp; It appears to be a mass of
black earth held together by vegetable fibres.&nbsp; I know not whether
the earth be bituminous, or whether the fibres be not the only combustible
part; which, by heating the interposed earth red hot, make a burning
mass.&nbsp; The heat is not very strong nor lasting.&nbsp; The ashes
are yellowish, and in a large quantity.&nbsp; When they dig peat, they
cut it into square pieces, and pile it up to dry beside the house.&nbsp;
In some places it has an offensive smell.&nbsp; It is like wood charked
for the smith.&nbsp; The common method of making peat fires, is by heaping
it on the hearth; but it burns well in grates, and in the best houses
is so used.</p>
<p>The common opinion is, that peat grows again where it has been cut;
which, as it seems to be chiefly a vegetable substance, is not unlikely
to be true, whether known or not to those who relate it.</p>
<p>There are water mills in Sky and Raasa; but where they are too far
distant, the house-wives grind their oats with a quern, or hand-mill,
which consists of two stones, about a foot and a half in diameter; the
lower is a little convex, to which the concavity of the upper must be
fitted.&nbsp; In the middle of the upper stone is a round hole, and
on one side is a long handle.&nbsp; The grinder sheds the corn gradually
into the hole with one hand, and works the handle round with the other.&nbsp;
The corn slides down the convexity of the lower stone, and by the motion
of the upper is ground in its passage.&nbsp; These stones are found
in Lochabar.</p>
<p>The Islands afford few pleasures, except to the hardy sportsman,
who can tread the moor and climb the mountain.&nbsp; The distance of
one family from another, in a country where travelling has so much difficulty,
makes frequent intercourse impracticable.&nbsp; Visits last several
days, and are commonly paid by water; yet I never saw a boat furnished
with benches, or made commodious by any addition to the first fabric.&nbsp;
Conveniences are not missed where they never were enjoyed.</p>
<p>The solace which the bagpipe can give, they have long enjoyed; but
among other changes, which the last Revolution introduced, the use of
the bagpipe begins to be forgotten.&nbsp; Some of the chief families
still entertain a piper, whose office was anciently hereditary.&nbsp;
Macrimmon was piper to Macleod, and Rankin to Maclean of Col.</p>
<p>The tunes of the bagpipe are traditional.&nbsp; There has been in
Sky, beyond all time of memory, a college of pipers, under the direction
of Macrimmon, which is not quite extinct.&nbsp; There was another in
Mull, superintended by Rankin, which expired about sixteen years ago.&nbsp;
To these colleges, while the pipe retained its honour, the students
of musick repaired for education.&nbsp; I have had my dinner exhilarated
by the bagpipe, at Armidale, at Dunvegan, and in Col.</p>
<p>The general conversation of the Islanders has nothing particular.&nbsp;
I did not meet with the inquisitiveness of which I have read, and suspect
the judgment to have been rashly made.&nbsp; A stranger of curiosity
comes into a place where a stranger is seldom seen: he importunes the
people with questions, of which they cannot guess the motive, and gazes
with surprise on things which they, having had them always before their
eyes, do not suspect of any thing wonderful.&nbsp; He appears to them
like some being of another world, and then thinks it peculiar that they
take their turn to inquire whence he comes, and whither he is going.</p>
<p>The Islands were long unfurnished with instruction for youth, and
none but the sons of gentlemen could have any literature.&nbsp; There
are now parochial schools, to which the lord of every manor pays a certain
stipend.&nbsp; Here the children are taught to read; but by the rule
of their institution, they teach only English, so that the natives read
a language which they may never use or understand.&nbsp; If a parish,
which often happens, contains several Islands, the school being but
in one, cannot assist the rest.&nbsp; This is the state of Col, which,
however, is more enlightened than some other places; for the deficiency
is supplied by a young gentleman, who, for his own improvement, travels
every year on foot over the Highlands to the session at Aberdeen; and
at his return, during the vacation, teaches to read and write in his
native Island.</p>
<p>In Sky there are two grammar schools, where boarders are taken to
be regularly educated.&nbsp; The price of board is from three pounds,
to four pounds ten shillings a year, and that of instruction is half
a crown a quarter.&nbsp; But the scholars are birds of passage, who
live at school only in the summer; for in winter provisions cannot be
made for any considerable number in one place.&nbsp; This periodical
dispersion impresses strongly the scarcity of these countries.</p>
<p>Having heard of no boarding-school for ladies nearer than Inverness,
I suppose their education is generally domestick.&nbsp; The elder daughters
of the higher families are sent into the world, and may contribute by
their acquisitions to the improvement of the rest.</p>
<p>Women must here study to be either pleasing or useful.&nbsp; Their
deficiencies are seldom supplied by very liberal fortunes.&nbsp; A hundred
pounds is a portion beyond the hope of any but the Laird&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
They do not indeed often give money with their daughters; the question
is, How many cows a young lady will bring her husband.&nbsp; A rich
maiden has from ten to forty; but two cows are a decent fortune for
one who pretends to no distinction.</p>
<p>The religion of the Islands is that of the Kirk of Scotland.&nbsp;
The gentlemen with whom I conversed are all inclined to the English
liturgy; but they are obliged to maintain the established Minister,
and the country is too poor to afford payment to another, who must live
wholly on the contribution of his audience.</p>
<p>They therefore all attend the worship of the Kirk, as often as a
visit from their Minister, or the practicability of travelling gives
them opportunity; nor have they any reason to complain of insufficient
pastors; for I saw not one in the Islands, whom I had reason to think
either deficient in learning, or irregular in life: but found several
with whom I could not converse without wishing, as my respect increased,
that they had not been Presbyterians.</p>
<p>The ancient rigour of puritanism is now very much relaxed, though
all are not yet equally enlightened.&nbsp; I sometimes met with prejudices
sufficiently malignant, but they were prejudices of ignorance.&nbsp;
The Ministers in the Islands had attained such knowledge as may justly
be admired in men, who have no motive to study, but generous curiosity,
or, what is still better, desire of usefulness; with such politeness
as so narrow a circle of converse could not have supplied, but to minds
naturally disposed to elegance.</p>
<p>Reason and truth will prevail at last.&nbsp; The most learned of
the Scottish Doctors would now gladly admit a form of prayer, if the
people would endure it.&nbsp; The zeal or rage of congregations has
its different degrees.&nbsp; In some parishes the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer
is suffered: in others it is still rejected as a form; and he that should
make it part of his supplication would be suspected of heretical pravity.</p>
<p>The principle upon which extemporary prayer was originally introduced,
is no longer admitted.&nbsp; The Minister formerly, in the effusion
of his prayer, expected immediate, and perhaps perceptible inspiration,
and therefore thought it his duty not to think before what he should
say.&nbsp; It is now universally confessed, that men pray as they speak
on other occasions, according to the general measure of their abilities
and attainments.&nbsp; Whatever each may think of a form prescribed
by another, he cannot but believe that he can himself compose by study
and meditation a better prayer than will rise in his mind at a sudden
call; and if he has any hope of supernatural help, why may he not as
well receive it when he writes as when he speaks?</p>
<p>In the variety of mental powers, some must perform extemporary prayer
with much imperfection; and in the eagerness and rashness of contradictory
opinions, if publick liturgy be left to the private judgment of every
Minister, the congregation may often be offended or misled.</p>
<p>There is in Scotland, as among ourselves, a restless suspicion of
popish machinations, and a clamour of numerous converts to the Romish
religion.&nbsp; The report is, I believe, in both parts of the Island
equally false.&nbsp; The Romish religion is professed only in Egg and
Canna, two small islands, into which the Reformation never made its
way.&nbsp; If any missionaries are busy in the Highlands, their zeal
entitles them to respect, even from those who cannot think favourably
of their doctrine.</p>
<p>The political tenets of the Islanders I was not curious to investigate,
and they were not eager to obtrude.&nbsp; Their conversation is decent
and inoffensive.&nbsp; They disdain to drink for their principles, and
there is no disaffection at their tables.&nbsp; I never heard a health
offered by a Highlander that might not have circulated with propriety
within the precincts of the King&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p>Legal government has yet something of novelty to which they cannot
perfectly conform.&nbsp; The ancient spirit, that appealed only to the
sword, is yet among them.&nbsp; The tenant of Scalpa, an island belonging
to Macdonald, took no care to bring his rent; when the landlord talked
of exacting payment, he declared his resolution to keep his ground,
and drive all intruders from the Island, and continued to feed his cattle
as on his own land, till it became necessary for the Sheriff to dislodge
him by violence.</p>
<p>The various kinds of superstition which prevailed here, as in all
other regions of ignorance, are by the diligence of the Ministers almost
extirpated.</p>
<p>Of Browny, mentioned by Martin, nothing has been heard for many years.&nbsp;
Browny was a sturdy Fairy; who, if he was fed, and kindly treated, would,
as they said, do a great deal of work.&nbsp; They now pay him no wages,
and are content to labour for themselves.</p>
<p>In Troda, within these three-and-thirty years, milk was put every
Saturday for Greogach, or &lsquo;the Old Man with the Long Beard.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Whether Greogach was courted as kind, or dreaded as terrible, whether
they meant, by giving him the milk, to obtain good, or avert evil, I
was not informed.&nbsp; The Minister is now living by whom the practice
was abolished.</p>
<p>They have still among them a great number of charms for the cure
of different diseases; they are all invocations, perhaps transmitted
to them from the times of popery, which increasing knowledge will bring
into disuse.</p>
<p>They have opinions, which cannot be ranked with superstition, because
they regard only natural effects.&nbsp; They expect better crops of
grain, by sowing their seed in the moon&rsquo;s increase.&nbsp; The
moon has great influence in vulgar philosophy.&nbsp; In my memory it
was a precept annually given in one of the English Almanacks, &lsquo;to
kill hogs when the moon was increasing, and the bacon would prove the
better in boiling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We should have had little claim to the praise of curiosity, if we
had not endeavoured with particular attention to examine the question
of the Second Sight.&nbsp; Of an opinion received for centuries by a
whole nation, and supposed to be confirmed through its whole descent,
by a series of successive facts, it is desirable that the truth should
be established, or the fallacy detected.</p>
<p>The Second Sight is an impression made either by the mind upon the
eye, or by the eye upon the mind, by which things distant or future
are perceived, and seen as if they were present.&nbsp; A man on a journey
far from home falls from his horse, another, who is perhaps at work
about the house, sees him bleeding on the ground, commonly with a landscape
of the place where the accident befalls him.&nbsp; Another seer, driving
home his cattle, or wandering in idleness, or musing in the sunshine,
is suddenly surprised by the appearance of a bridal ceremony, or funeral
procession, and counts the mourners or attendants, of whom, if he knows
them, he relates the names, if he knows them not, he can describe the
dresses.&nbsp; Things distant are seen at the instant when they happen.&nbsp;
Of things future I know not that there is any rule for determining the
time between the Sight and the event.</p>
<p>This receptive faculty, for power it cannot be called, is neither
voluntary nor constant.&nbsp; The appearances have no dependence upon
choice: they cannot be summoned, detained, or recalled.&nbsp; The impression
is sudden, and the effect often painful.</p>
<p>By the term Second Sight, seems to be meant a mode of seeing, superadded
to that which Nature generally bestows.&nbsp; In the Earse it is called
Taisch; which signifies likewise a spectre, or a vision.&nbsp; I know
not, nor is it likely that the Highlanders ever examined, whether by
Taisch, used for Second Sight, they mean the power of seeing, or the
thing seen.</p>
<p>I do not find it to be true, as it is reported, that to the Second
Sight nothing is presented but phantoms of evil.&nbsp; Good seems to
have the same proportions in those visionary scenes, as it obtains in
real life: almost all remarkable events have evil for their basis; and
are either miseries incurred, or miseries escaped.&nbsp; Our sense is
so much stronger of what we suffer, than of what we enjoy, that the
ideas of pain predominate in almost every mind.&nbsp; What is recollection
but a revival of vexations, or history but a record of wars, treasons,
and calamities?&nbsp; Death, which is considered as the greatest evil,
happens to all.&nbsp; The greatest good, be it what it will, is the
lot but of a part.</p>
<p>That they should often see death is to be expected; because death
is an event frequent and important.&nbsp; But they see likewise more
pleasing incidents.&nbsp; A gentleman told me, that when he had once
gone far from his own Island, one of his labouring servants predicted
his return, and described the livery of his attendant, which he had
never worn at home; and which had been, without any previous design,
occasionally given him.</p>
<p>Our desire of information was keen, and our inquiry frequent.&nbsp;
Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s frankness and gaiety made every body communicative;
and we heard many tales of these airy shows, with more or less evidence
and distinctness.</p>
<p>It is the common talk of the Lowland Scots, that the notion of the
Second Sight is wearing away with other superstitions; and that its
reality is no longer supposed, but by the grossest people.&nbsp; How
far its prevalence ever extended, or what ground it has lost, I know
not.&nbsp; The Islanders of all degrees, whether of rank or understanding,
universally admit it, except the Ministers, who universally deny it,
and are suspected to deny it, in consequence of a system, against conviction.&nbsp;
One of them honestly told me, that he came to Sky with a resolution
not to believe it.</p>
<p>Strong reasons for incredulity will readily occur.&nbsp; This faculty
of seeing things out of sight is local, and commonly useless.&nbsp;
It is a breach of the common order of things, without any visible reason
or perceptible benefit.&nbsp; It is ascribed only to a people very little
enlightened; and among them, for the most part, to the mean and the
ignorant.</p>
<p>To the confidence of these objections it may be replied, that by
presuming to determine what is fit, and what is beneficial, they presuppose
more knowledge of the universal system than man has attained; and therefore
depend upon principles too complicated and extensive for our comprehension;
and that there can be no security in the consequence, when the premises
are not understood; that the Second Sight is only wonderful because
it is rare, for, considered in itself, it involves no more difficulty
than dreams, or perhaps than the regular exercise of the cogitative
faculty; that a general opinion of communicative impulses, or visionary
representations, has prevailed in all ages and all nations; that particular
instances have been given, with such evidence, as neither Bacon nor
Bayle has been able to resist; that sudden impressions, which the event
has verified, have been felt by more than own or publish them; that
the Second Sight of the Hebrides implies only the local frequency of
a power, which is nowhere totally unknown; and that where we are unable
to decide by antecedent reason, we must be content to yield to the force
of testimony.</p>
<p>By pretension to Second Sight, no profit was ever sought or gained.&nbsp;
It is an involuntary affection, in which neither hope nor fear are known
to have any part.&nbsp; Those who profess to feel it, do not boast of
it as a privilege, nor are considered by others as advantageously distinguished.&nbsp;
They have no temptation to feign; and their hearers have no motive to
encourage the imposture.</p>
<p>To talk with any of these seers is not easy.&nbsp; There is one living
in Sky, with whom we would have gladly conversed; but he was very gross
and ignorant, and knew no English.&nbsp; The proportion in these countries
of the poor to the rich is such, that if we suppose the quality to be
accidental, it can very rarely happen to a man of education; and yet
on such men it has sometimes fallen.&nbsp; There is now a Second Sighted
gentleman in the Highlands, who complains of the terrors to which he
is exposed.</p>
<p>The foresight of the Seers is not always prescience; they are impressed
with images, of which the event only shews them the meaning.&nbsp; They
tell what they have seen to others, who are at that time not more knowing
than themselves, but may become at last very adequate witnesses, by
comparing the narrative with its verification.</p>
<p>To collect sufficient testimonies for the satisfaction of the publick,
or of ourselves, would have required more time than we could bestow.&nbsp;
There is, against it, the seeming analogy of things confusedly seen,
and little understood, and for it, the indistinct cry of national persuasion,
which may be perhaps resolved at last into prejudice and tradition.&nbsp;
I never could advance my curiosity to conviction; but came away at last
only willing to believe.</p>
<p>As there subsists no longer in the Islands much of that peculiar
and discriminative form of life, of which the idea had delighted our
imagination, we were willing to listen to such accounts of past times
as would be given us.&nbsp; But we soon found what memorials were to
be expected from an illiterate people, whose whole time is a series
of distress; where every morning is labouring with expedients for the
evening; and where all mental pains or pleasure arose from the dread
of winter, the expectation of spring, the caprices of their Chiefs,
and the motions of the neighbouring clans; where there was neither shame
from ignorance, nor pride in knowledge; neither curiosity to inquire,
nor vanity to communicate.</p>
<p>The Chiefs indeed were exempt from urgent penury, and daily difficulties;
and in their houses were preserved what accounts remained of past ages.&nbsp;
But the Chiefs were sometimes ignorant and careless, and sometimes kept
busy by turbulence and contention; and one generation of ignorance effaces
the whole series of unwritten history.&nbsp; Books are faithful repositories,
which may be a while neglected or forgotten; but when they are opened
again, will again impart their instruction: memory, once interrupted,
is not to be recalled.&nbsp; Written learning is a fixed luminary, which,
after the cloud that had hidden it has past away, is again bright in
its proper station.&nbsp; Tradition is but a meteor, which, if once
it falls, cannot be rekindled.</p>
<p>It seems to be universally supposed, that much of the local history
was preserved by the Bards, of whom one is said to have been retained
by every great family.&nbsp; After these Bards were some of my first
inquiries; and I received such answers as, for a while, made me please
myself with my increase of knowledge; for I had not then learned how
to estimate the narration of a Highlander.</p>
<p>They said that a great family had a Bard and a Senachi, who were
the poet and historian of the house; and an old gentleman told me that
he remembered one of each.&nbsp; Here was a dawn of intelligence.&nbsp;
Of men that had lived within memory, some certain knowledge might be
attained.&nbsp; Though the office had ceased, its effects might continue;
the poems might be found, though there was no poet.</p>
<p>Another conversation indeed informed me, that the same man was both
Bard and Senachi.&nbsp; This variation discouraged me; but as the practice
might be different in different times, or at the same time in different
families, there was yet no reason for supposing that I must necessarily
sit down in total ignorance.</p>
<p>Soon after I was told by a gentleman, who is generally acknowledged
the greatest master of Hebridian antiquities, that there had indeed
once been both Bards and Senachies; and that Senachi signified &lsquo;the
man of talk,&rsquo; or of conversation; but that neither Bard nor Senachi
had existed for some centuries.&nbsp; I have no reason to suppose it
exactly known at what time the custom ceased, nor did it probably cease
in all houses at once.&nbsp; But whenever the practice of recitation
was disused, the works, whether poetical or historical, perished with
the authors; for in those times nothing had been written in the Earse
language.</p>
<p>Whether the &lsquo;Man of talk&rsquo; was a historian, whose office
was to tell truth, or a story-teller, like those which were in the last
century, and perhaps are now among the Irish, whose trade was only to
amuse, it now would be vain to inquire.</p>
<p>Most of the domestick offices were, I believe, hereditary; and probably
the laureat of a clan was always the son of the last laureat.&nbsp;
The history of the race could no otherwise be communicated, or retained;
but what genius could be expected in a poet by inheritance?</p>
<p>The nation was wholly illiterate.&nbsp; Neither bards nor Senachies
could write or read; but if they were ignorant, there was no danger
of detection; they were believed by those whose vanity they flattered.</p>
<p>The recital of genealogies, which has been considered as very efficacious
to the preservation of a true series of ancestry, was anciently made,
when the heir of the family came to manly age.&nbsp; This practice has
never subsisted within time of memory, nor was much credit due to such
rehearsers, who might obtrude fictitious pedigrees, either to please
their masters, or to hide the deficiency of their own memories.</p>
<p>Where the Chiefs of the Highlands have found the histories of their
descent is difficult to tell; for no Earse genealogy was ever written.&nbsp;
In general this only is evident, that the principal house of a clan
must be very ancient, and that those must have lived long in a place,
of whom it is not known when they came thither.</p>
<p>Thus hopeless are all attempts to find any traces of Highland learning.&nbsp;
Nor are their primitive customs and ancient manner of life otherwise
than very faintly and uncertainly remembered by the present race.</p>
<p>The peculiarities which strike the native of a commercial country,
proceeded in a great measure from the want of money.&nbsp; To the servants
and dependents that were not domesticks, and if an estimate be made
from the capacity of any of their old houses which I have seen, their
domesticks could have been but few, were appropriated certain portions
of land for their support.&nbsp; Macdonald has a piece of ground yet,
called the Bards or Senachies field.&nbsp; When a beef was killed for
the house, particular parts were claimed as fees by the several officers,
or workmen.&nbsp; What was the right of each I have not learned.&nbsp;
The head belonged to the smith, and the udder of a cow to the piper:
the weaver had likewise his particular part; and so many pieces followed
these prescriptive claims, that the Laird&rsquo;s was at last but little.</p>
<p>The payment of rent in kind has been so long disused in England,
that it is totally forgotten.&nbsp; It was practised very lately in
the Hebrides, and probably still continues, not only in St. Kilda, where
money is not yet known, but in others of the smaller and remoter Islands.&nbsp;
It were perhaps to be desired, that no change in this particular should
have been made.&nbsp; When the Laird could only eat the produce of his
lands, he was under the necessity of residing upon them; and when the
tenant could not convert his stock into more portable riches, he could
never be tempted away from his farm, from the only place where he could
be wealthy.&nbsp; Money confounds subordination, by overpowering the
distinctions of rank and birth, and weakens authority by supplying power
of resistance, or expedients for escape.&nbsp; The feudal system is
formed for a nation employed in agriculture, and has never long kept
its hold where gold and silver have become common.</p>
<p>Their arms were anciently the Glaymore, or great two-handed sword,
and afterwards the two-edged sword and target, or buckler, which was
sustained on the left arm.&nbsp; In the midst of the target, which was
made of wood, covered with leather, and studded with nails, a slender
lance, about two feet long, was sometimes fixed; it was heavy and cumberous,
and accordingly has for some time past been gradually laid aside.&nbsp;
Very few targets were at Culloden.&nbsp; The dirk, or broad dagger,
I am afraid, was of more use in private quarrels than in battles.&nbsp;
The Lochaber-ax is only a slight alteration of the old English bill.</p>
<p>After all that has been said of the force and terrour of the Highland
sword, I could not find that the art of defence was any part of common
education.&nbsp; The gentlemen were perhaps sometimes skilful gladiators,
but the common men had no other powers than those of violence and courage.&nbsp;
Yet it is well known, that the onset of the Highlanders was very formidable.&nbsp;
As an army cannot consist of philosophers, a panick is easily excited
by any unwonted mode of annoyance.&nbsp; New dangers are naturally magnified;
and men accustomed only to exchange bullets at a distance, and rather
to hear their enemies than see them, are discouraged and amazed when
they find themselves encountered hand to hand, and catch the gleam of
steel flashing in their faces.</p>
<p>The Highland weapons gave opportunity for many exertions of personal
courage, and sometimes for single combats in the field; like those which
occur so frequently in fabulous wars.&nbsp; At Falkirk, a gentleman
now living, was, I suppose after the retreat of the King&rsquo;s troops,
engaged at a distance from the rest with an Irish dragoon.&nbsp; They
were both skilful swordsmen, and the contest was not easily decided:
the dragoon at last had the advantage, and the Highlander called for
quarter; but quarter was refused him, and the fight continued till he
was reduced to defend himself upon his knee.&nbsp; At that instant one
of the Macleods came to his rescue; who, as it is said, offered quarter
to the dragoon, but he thought himself obliged to reject what he had
before refused, and, as battle gives little time to deliberate, was
immediately killed.</p>
<p>Funerals were formerly solemnized by calling multitudes together,
and entertaining them at great expence.&nbsp; This emulation of useless
cost has been for some time discouraged, and at last in the Isle of
Sky is almost suppressed.</p>
<p>Of the Earse language, as I understand nothing, I cannot say more
than I have been told.&nbsp; It is the rude speech of a barbarous people,
who had few thoughts to express, and were content, as they conceived
grossly, to be grossly understood.&nbsp; After what has been lately
talked of Highland Bards, and Highland genius, many will startle when
they are told, that the Earse never was a written language; that there
is not in the world an Earse manuscript a hundred years old; and that
the sounds of the Highlanders were never expressed by letters, till
some little books of piety were translated, and a metrical version of
the Psalms was made by the Synod of Argyle.&nbsp; Whoever therefore
now writes in this language, spells according to his own perception
of the sound, and his own idea of the power of the letters.&nbsp; The
Welsh and the Irish are cultivated tongues.&nbsp; The Welsh, two hundred
years ago, insulted their English neighbours for the instability of
their Orthography; while the Earse merely floated in the breath of the
people, and could therefore receive little improvement.</p>
<p>When a language begins to teem with books, it is tending to refinement;
as those who undertake to teach others must have undergone some labour
in improving themselves, they set a proportionate value on their own
thoughts, and wish to enforce them by efficacious expressions; speech
becomes embodied and permanent; different modes and phrases are compared,
and the best obtains an establishment.&nbsp; By degrees one age improves
upon another.&nbsp; Exactness is first obtained, and afterwards elegance.&nbsp;
But diction, merely vocal, is always in its childhood.&nbsp; As no man
leaves his eloquence behind him, the new generations have all to learn.&nbsp;
There may possibly be books without a polished language, but there can
be no polished language without books.</p>
<p>That the Bards could not read more than the rest of their countrymen,
it is reasonable to suppose; because, if they had read, they could probably
have written; and how high their compositions may reasonably be rated,
an inquirer may best judge by considering what stores of imagery, what
principles of ratiocination, what comprehension of knowledge, and what
delicacy of elocution he has known any man attain who cannot read.&nbsp;
The state of the Bards was yet more hopeless.&nbsp; He that cannot read,
may now converse with those that can; but the Bard was a barbarian among
barbarians, who, knowing nothing himself, lived with others that knew
no more.</p>
<p>There has lately been in the Islands one of these illiterate poets,
who hearing the Bible read at church, is said to have turned the sacred
history into verse.&nbsp; I heard part of a dialogue, composed by him,
translated by a young lady in Mull, and thought it had more meaning
than I expected from a man totally uneducated; but he had some opportunities
of knowledge; he lived among a learned people.&nbsp; After all that
has been done for the instruction of the Highlanders, the antipathy
between their language and literature still continues; and no man that
has learned only Earse is, at this time, able to read.</p>
<p>The Earse has many dialects, and the words used in some Islands are
not always known in others.&nbsp; In literate nations, though the pronunciation,
and sometimes the words of common speech may differ, as now in England,
compared with the South of Scotland, yet there is a written diction,
which pervades all dialects, and is understood in every province.&nbsp;
But where the whole language is colloquial, he that has only one part,
never gets the rest, as he cannot get it but by change of residence.</p>
<p>In an unwritten speech, nothing that is not very short is transmitted
from one generation to another.&nbsp; Few have opportunities of hearing
a long composition often enough to learn it, or have inclination to
repeat it so often as is necessary to retain it; and what is once forgotten
is lost for ever.&nbsp; I believe there cannot be recovered, in the
whole Earse language, five hundred lines of which there is any evidence
to prove them a hundred years old.&nbsp; Yet I hear that the father
of Ossian boasts of two chests more of ancient poetry, which he suppresses,
because they are too good for the English.</p>
<p>He that goes into the Highlands with a mind naturally acquiescent,
and a credulity eager for wonders, may come back with an opinion very
different from mine; for the inhabitants knowing the ignorance of all
strangers in their language and antiquities, perhaps are not very scrupulous
adherents to truth; yet I do not say that they deliberately speak studied
falsehood, or have a settled purpose to deceive.&nbsp; They have inquired
and considered little, and do not always feel their own ignorance.&nbsp;
They are not much accustomed to be interrogated by others; and seem
never to have thought upon interrogating themselves; so that if they
do not know what they tell to be true, they likewise do not distinctly
perceive it to be false.</p>
<p>Mr. Boswell was very diligent in his inquiries; and the result of
his investigations was, that the answer to the second question was commonly
such as nullified the answer to the first.</p>
<p>We were a while told, that they had an old translation of the scriptures;
and told it till it would appear obstinacy to inquire again.&nbsp; Yet
by continued accumulation of questions we found, that the translation
meant, if any meaning there were, was nothing else than the Irish Bible.</p>
<p>We heard of manuscripts that were, or that had been in the hands
of somebody&rsquo;s father, or grandfather; but at last we had no reason
to believe they were other than Irish.&nbsp; Martin mentions Irish,
but never any Earse manuscripts, to be found in the Islands in his time.</p>
<p>I suppose my opinion of the poems of Ossian is already discovered.&nbsp;
I believe they never existed in any other form than that which we have
seen.&nbsp; The editor, or author, never could shew the original; nor
can it be shewn by any other; to revenge reasonable incredulity, by
refusing evidence, is a degree of insolence, with which the world is
not yet acquainted; and stubborn audacity is the last refuge of guilt.&nbsp;
It would be easy to shew it if he had it; but whence could it be had?&nbsp;
It is too long to be remembered, and the language formerly had nothing
written.&nbsp; He has doubtless inserted names that circulate in popular
stories, and may have translated some wandering ballads, if any can
be found; and the names, and some of the images being recollected, make
an inaccurate auditor imagine, by the help of Caledonian bigotry, that
he has formerly heard the whole.</p>
<p>I asked a very learned Minister in Sky, who had used all arts to
make me believe the genuineness of the book, whether at last he believed
it himself? but he would not answer.&nbsp; He wished me to be deceived,
for the honour of his country; but would not directly and formally deceive
me.&nbsp; Yet has this man&rsquo;s testimony been publickly produced,
as of one that held Fingal to be the work of Ossian.</p>
<p>It is said, that some men of integrity profess to have heard parts
of it, but they all heard them when they were boys; and it was never
said that any of them could recite six lines.&nbsp; They remember names,
and perhaps some proverbial sentiments; and, having no distinct ideas,
coin a resemblance without an original.&nbsp; The persuasion of the
Scots, however, is far from universal; and in a question so capable
of proof, why should doubt be suffered to continue?&nbsp; The editor
has been heard to say, that part of the poem was received by him, in
the Saxon character.&nbsp; He has then found, by some peculiar fortune,
an unwritten language, written in a character which the natives probably
never beheld.</p>
<p>I have yet supposed no imposture but in the publisher, yet I am far
from certainty, that some translations have not been lately made, that
may now be obtruded as parts of the original work.&nbsp; Credulity on
one part is a strong temptation to deceit on the other, especially to
deceit of which no personal injury is the consequence, and which flatters
the author with his own ingenuity.&nbsp; The Scots have something to
plead for their easy reception of an improbable fiction; they are seduced
by their fondness for their supposed ancestors.&nbsp; A Scotchman must
be a very sturdy moralist, who does not love Scotland better than truth:
he will always love it better than inquiry; and if falsehood flatters
his vanity, will not be very diligent to detect it.&nbsp; Neither ought
the English to be much influenced by Scotch authority; for of the past
and present state of the whole Earse nation, the Lowlanders are at least
as ignorant as ourselves.&nbsp; To be ignorant is painful; but it is
dangerous to quiet our uneasiness by the delusive opiate of hasty persuasion.</p>
<p>But this is the age, in which those who could not read, have been
supposed to write; in which the giants of antiquated romance have been
exhibited as realities.&nbsp; If we know little of the ancient Highlanders,
let us not fill the vacuity with Ossian.&nbsp; If we had not searched
the Magellanick regions, let us however forbear to people them with
Patagons.</p>
<p>Having waited some days at Armidel, we were flattered at last with
a wind that promised to convey us to Mull.&nbsp; We went on board a
boat that was taking in kelp, and left the Isle of Sky behind us.&nbsp;
We were doomed to experience, like others, the danger of trusting to
the wind, which blew against us, in a short time, with such violence,
that we, being no seasoned sailors, were willing to call it a tempest.&nbsp;
I was sea-sick and lay down.&nbsp; Mr. Boswell kept the deck.&nbsp;
The master knew not well whither to go; and our difficulties might perhaps
have filled a very pathetick page, had not Mr. Maclean of Col, who,
with every other qualification which insular life requires, is a very
active and skilful mariner, piloted us safe into his own harbour.</p>
<h2>COL</h2>
<p>In the morning we found ourselves under the Isle of Col, where we
landed; and passed the first day and night with Captain Maclean, a gentleman
who has lived some time in the East Indies; but having dethroned no
Nabob, is not too rich to settle in own country.</p>
<p>Next day the wind was fair, and we might have had an easy passage
to Mull; but having, contrarily to our own intention, landed upon a
new Island, we would not leave it wholly unexamined.&nbsp; We therefore
suffered the vessel to depart without us, and trusted the skies for
another wind.</p>
<p>Mr. Maclean of Col, having a very numerous family, has, for some
time past, resided at Aberdeen, that he may superintend their education,
and leaves the young gentleman, our friend, to govern his dominions,
with the full power of a Highland Chief.&nbsp; By the absence of the
Laird&rsquo;s family, our entertainment was made more difficult, because
the house was in a great degree disfurnished; but young Col&rsquo;s
kindness and activity supplied all defects, and procured us more than
sufficient accommodation.</p>
<p>Here I first mounted a little Highland steed; and if there had been
many spectators, should have been somewhat ashamed of my figure in the
march.&nbsp; The horses of the Islands, as of other barren countries,
are very low: they are indeed musculous and strong, beyond what their
size gives reason for expecting; but a bulky man upon one of their backs
makes a very disproportionate appearance.</p>
<p>From the habitation of Captain Maclean, we went to Grissipol, but
called by the way on Mr. Hector Maclean, the Minister of Col, whom we
found in a hut, that is, a house of only one floor, but with windows
and chimney, and not inelegantly furnished.&nbsp; Mr. Maclean has the
reputation of great learning: he is seventy-seven years old, but not
infirm, with a look of venerable dignity, excelling what I remember
in any other man.</p>
<p>His conversation was not unsuitable to his appearance.&nbsp; I lost
some of his good-will, by treating a heretical writer with more regard
than, in his opinion, a heretick could deserve.&nbsp; I honoured his
orthodoxy, and did not much censure his asperity.&nbsp; A man who has
settled his opinions, does not love to have the tranquillity of his
conviction disturbed; and at seventy-seven it is time to be in earnest.</p>
<p>Mention was made of the Earse translation of the New Testament, which
has been lately published, and of which the learned Mr. Macqueen of
Sky spoke with commendation; but Mr. Maclean said he did not use it,
because he could make the text more intelligible to his auditors by
an extemporary version.&nbsp; From this I inferred, that the language
of the translation was not the language of the Isle of Col.</p>
<p>He has no publick edifice for the exercise of his ministry; and can
officiate to no greater number, than a room can contain; and the room
of a hut is not very large.&nbsp; This is all the opportunity of worship
that is now granted to the inhabitants of the Island, some of whom must
travel thither perhaps ten miles.&nbsp; Two chapels were erected by
their ancestors, of which I saw the skeletons, which now stand faithful
witnesses of the triumph of the Reformation.</p>
<p>The want of churches is not the only impediment to piety: there is
likewise a want of Ministers.&nbsp; A parish often contains more Islands
than one; and each Island can have the Minister only in its own turn.&nbsp;
At Raasa they had, I think, a right to service only every third Sunday.&nbsp;
All the provision made by the present ecclesiastical constitution, for
the inhabitants of about a hundred square miles, is a prayer and sermon
in a little room, once in three weeks: and even this parsimonious distribution
is at the mercy of the weather; and in those Islands where the Minister
does not reside, it is impossible to tell how many weeks or months may
pass without any publick exercise of religion.</p>
<h2>GRISSIPOL IN COL</h2>
<p>After a short conversation with Mr. Maclean, we went on to Grissipol,
a house and farm tenanted by Mr. Macsweyn, where I saw more of the ancient
life of a Highlander, than I had yet found.&nbsp; Mrs. Macsweyn could
speak no English, and had never seen any other places than the Islands
of Sky, Mull, and Col: but she was hospitable and good-humoured, and
spread her table with sufficient liberality.&nbsp; We found tea here,
as in every other place, but our spoons were of horn.</p>
<p>The house of Grissipol stands by a brook very clear and quick; which
is, I suppose, one of the most copious streams in the Island.&nbsp;
This place was the scene of an action, much celebrated in the traditional
history of Col, but which probably no two relaters will tell alike.</p>
<p>Some time, in the obscure ages, Macneil of Barra married the Lady
Maclean, who had the Isle of Col for her jointure.&nbsp; Whether Macneil
detained Col, when the widow was dead, or whether she lived so long
as to make her heirs impatient, is perhaps not now known.&nbsp; The
younger son, called John Gerves, or John the Giant, a man of great strength
who was then in Ireland, either for safety, or for education, dreamed
of recovering his inheritance; and getting some adventurers together,
which, in those unsettled times, was not hard to do, invaded Col.&nbsp;
He was driven away, but was not discouraged, and collecting new followers,
in three years came again with fifty men.&nbsp; In his way he stopped
at Artorinish in Morvern, where his uncle was prisoner to Macleod, and
was then with his enemies in a tent.&nbsp; Maclean took with him only
one servant, whom he ordered to stay at the outside; and where he should
see the tent pressed outwards, to strike with his dirk, it being the
intention of Maclean, as any man provoked him, to lay hands upon him,
and push him back.&nbsp; He entered the tent alone, with his Lochabar-axe
in his hand, and struck such terror into the whole assembly, that they
dismissed his uncle.</p>
<p>When he landed at Col, he saw the sentinel, who kept watch towards
the sea, running off to Grissipol, to give Macneil, who was there with
a hundred and twenty men, an account of the invasion.&nbsp; He told
Macgill, one of his followers, that if he intercepted that dangerous
intelligence, by catching the courier, he would give him certain lands
in Mull.&nbsp; Upon this promise, Macgill pursued the messenger, and
either killed, or stopped him; and his posterity, till very lately,
held the lands in Mull.</p>
<p>The alarm being thus prevented, he came unexpectedly upon Macneil.&nbsp;
Chiefs were in those days never wholly unprovided for an enemy.&nbsp;
A fight ensued, in which one of their followers is said to have given
an extraordinary proof of activity, by bounding backwards over the brook
of Grissipol.&nbsp; Macneil being killed, and many of his clan destroyed,
Maclean took possession of the Island, which the Macneils attempted
to conquer by another invasion, but were defeated and repulsed.</p>
<p>Maclean, in his turn, invaded the estate of the Macneils, took the
castle of Brecacig, and conquered the Isle of Barra, which he held for
seven years, and then restored it to the heirs.</p>
<h2>CASTLE OF COL</h2>
<p>From Grissipol, Mr. Maclean conducted us to his father&rsquo;s seat;
a neat new house, erected near the old castle, I think, by the last
proprietor.&nbsp; Here we were allowed to take our station, and lived
very commodiously, while we waited for moderate weather and a fair wind,
which we did not so soon obtain, but we had time to get some information
of the present state of Col, partly by inquiry, and partly by occasional
excursions.</p>
<p>Col is computed to be thirteen miles in length, and three in breadth.&nbsp;
Both the ends are the property of the Duke of Argyle, but the middle
belongs to Maclean, who is called Col, as the only Laird.</p>
<p>Col is not properly rocky; it is rather one continued rock, of a
surface much diversified with protuberances, and covered with a thin
layer of earth, which is often broken, and discovers the stone.&nbsp;
Such a soil is not for plants that strike deep roots; and perhaps in
the whole Island nothing has ever yet grown to the height of a table.&nbsp;
The uncultivated parts are clothed with heath, among which industry
has interspersed spots of grass and corn; but no attempt has yet been
made to raise a tree.&nbsp; Young Col, who has a very laudable desire
of improving his patrimony, purposes some time to plant an orchard;
which, if it be sheltered by a wall, may perhaps succeed.&nbsp; He has
introduced the culture of turnips, of which he has a field, where the
whole work was performed by his own hand.&nbsp; His intention is to
provide food for his cattle in the winter.&nbsp; This innovation was
considered by Mr. Macsweyn as the idle project of a young head, heated
with English fancies; but he has now found that turnips will really
grow, and that hungry sheep and cows will really eat them.</p>
<p>By such acquisitions as these, the Hebrides may in time rise above
their annual distress.&nbsp; Wherever heath will grow, there is reason
to think something better may draw nourishment; and by trying the production
of other places, plants will be found suitable to every soil.</p>
<p>Col has many lochs, some of which have trouts and eels, and others
have never yet been stocked; another proof of the negligence of the
Islanders, who might take fish in the inland waters, when they cannot
go to sea.</p>
<p>Their quadrupeds are horses, cows, sheep, and goats.&nbsp; They have
neither deer, hares, nor rabbits.&nbsp; They have no vermin, except
rats, which have been lately brought thither by sea, as to other places;
and are free from serpents, frogs, and toads.</p>
<p>The harvest in Col, and in Lewis, is ripe sooner than in Sky; and
the winter in Col is never cold, but very tempestuous.&nbsp; I know
not that I ever heard the wind so loud in any other place; and Mr. Boswell
observed, that its noise was all its own, for there were no trees to
increase it.</p>
<p>Noise is not the worst effect of the tempests; for they have thrown
the sand from the shore over a considerable part of the land; and it
is said still to encroach and destroy more and more pasture; but I am
not of opinion, that by any surveys or landmarks, its limits have been
ever fixed, or its progression ascertained.&nbsp; If one man has confidence
enough to say, that it advances, nobody can bring any proof to support
him in denying it.&nbsp; The reason why it is not spread to a greater
extent, seems to be, that the wind and rain come almost together, and
that it is made close and heavy by the wet before the storms can put
it in motion.&nbsp; So thick is the bed, and so small the particles,
that if a traveller should be caught by a sudden gust in dry weather,
he would find it very difficult to escape with life.</p>
<p>For natural curiosities, I was shown only two great masses of stone,
which lie loose upon the ground; one on the top of a hill, and the other
at a small distance from the bottom.&nbsp; They certainly were never
put into their present places by human strength or skill; and though
an earthquake might have broken off the lower stone, and rolled it into
the valley, no account can be given of the other, which lies on the
hill, unless, which I forgot to examine, there be still near it some
higher rock, from which it might be torn.&nbsp; All nations have a tradition,
that their earliest ancestors were giants, and these stones are said
to have been thrown up and down by a giant and his mistress.&nbsp; There
are so many more important things, of which human knowledge can give
no account, that it may be forgiven us, if we speculate no longer on
two stones in Col.</p>
<p>This Island is very populous.&nbsp; About nine-and-twenty years ago,
the fencible men of Col were reckoned one hundred and forty, which is
the sixth of eight hundred and forty; and probably some contrived to
be left out of the list.&nbsp; The Minister told us, that a few years
ago the inhabitants were eight hundred, between the ages of seven and
of seventy.&nbsp; Round numbers are seldom exact.&nbsp; But in this
case the authority is good, and the errour likely to be little.&nbsp;
If to the eight hundred be added what the laws of computation require,
they will be increased to at least a thousand; and if the dimensions
of the country have been accurately related, every mile maintains more
than twenty-five.</p>
<p>This proportion of habitation is greater than the appearance of the
country seems to admit; for wherever the eye wanders, it sees much waste
and little cultivation.&nbsp; I am more inclined to extend the land,
of which no measure has ever been taken, than to diminish the people,
who have been really numbered.&nbsp; Let it be supposed, that a computed
mile contains a mile and a half, as was commonly found true in the mensuration
of the English roads, and we shall then allot nearly twelve to a mile,
which agrees much better with ocular observation.</p>
<p>Here, as in Sky, and other Islands, are the Laird, the Tacksmen,
and the under tenants.</p>
<p>Mr. Maclean, the Laird, has very extensive possessions, being proprietor,
not only of far the greater part of Col, but of the extensive Island
of Rum, and a very considerable territory in Mull.</p>
<p>Rum is one of the larger Islands, almost square, and therefore of
great capacity in proportion to its sides.&nbsp; By the usual method
of estimating computed extent, it may contain more than a hundred and
twenty square miles.</p>
<p>It originally belonged to Clanronald, and was purchased by Col; who,
in some dispute about the bargain, made Clanronald prisoner, and kept
him nine months in confinement.&nbsp; Its owner represents it as mountainous,
rugged, and barren.&nbsp; In the hills there are red deer.&nbsp; The
horses are very small, but of a breed eminent for beauty.&nbsp; Col,
not long ago, bought one of them from a tenant; who told him, that as
he was of a shape uncommonly elegant, he could not sell him but at a
high price; and that whoever had him should pay a guinea and a half.</p>
<p>There are said to be in Barra a race of horses yet smaller, of which
the highest is not above thirty-six inches.</p>
<p>The rent of Rum is not great.&nbsp; Mr. Maclean declared, that he
should be very rich, if he could set his land at two-pence halfpenny
an acre.&nbsp; The inhabitants are fifty-eight families, who continued
Papists for some time after the Laird became a Protestant.&nbsp; Their
adherence to their old religion was strengthened by the countenance
of the Laird&rsquo;s sister, a zealous Romanist, till one Sunday, as
they were going to mass under the conduct of their patroness, Maclean
met them on the way, gave one of them a blow on the head with a yellow
stick, I suppose a cane, for which the Earse had no name, and drove
them to the kirk, from which they have never since departed.&nbsp; Since
the use of this method of conversion, the inhabitants of Egg and Canna,
who continue Papists, call the Protestantism of Rum, the religion of
the Yellow Stick.</p>
<p>The only Popish Islands are Egg and Canna.&nbsp; Egg is the principal
Island of a parish, in which, though he has no congregation, the Protestant
Minister resides.&nbsp; I have heard of nothing curious in it, but the
cave in which a former generation of the Islanders were smothered by
Macleod.</p>
<p>If we had travelled with more leisure, it had not been fit to have
neglected the Popish Islands.&nbsp; Popery is favourable to ceremony;
and among ignorant nations, ceremony is the only preservative of tradition.&nbsp;
Since protestantism was extended to the savage parts of Scotland, it
has perhaps been one of the chief labours of the Ministers to abolish
stated observances, because they continued the remembrance of the former
religion.&nbsp; We therefore who came to hear old traditions, and see
antiquated manners, should probably have found them amongst the Papists.</p>
<p>Canna, the other Popish Island, belongs to Clanronald.&nbsp; It is
said not to comprise more than twelve miles of land, and yet maintains
as many inhabitants as Rum.</p>
<p>We were at Col under the protection of the young Laird, without any
of the distresses, which Mr. Pennant, in a fit of simple credulity,
seems to think almost worthy of an elegy by Ossian.&nbsp; Wherever we
roved, we were pleased to see the reverence with which his subjects
regarded him.&nbsp; He did not endeavour to dazzle them by any magnificence
of dress: his only distinction was a feather in his bonnet; but as soon
as he appeared, they forsook their work and clustered about him: he
took them by the hand, and they seemed mutually delighted.&nbsp; He
has the proper disposition of a Chieftain, and seems desirous to continue
the customs of his house.&nbsp; The bagpiper played regularly, when
dinner was served, whose person and dress made a good appearance; and
he brought no disgrace upon the family of Rankin, which has long supplied
the Lairds of Col with hereditary musick.</p>
<p>The Tacksmen of Col seem to live with less dignity and convenience
than those of Sky; where they had good houses, and tables not only plentiful,
but delicate.&nbsp; In Col only two houses pay the window tax; for only
two have six windows, which, I suppose, are the Laird&rsquo;s and Mr.
Macsweyn&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The rents have, till within seven years, been paid in kind, but the
tenants finding that cattle and corn varied in their price, desired
for the future to give their landlord money; which, not having yet arrived
at the philosophy of commerce, they consider as being every year of
the same value.</p>
<p>We were told of a particular mode of under-tenure.&nbsp; The Tacksman
admits some of his inferior neighbours to the cultivation of his grounds,
on condition that performing all the work, and giving a third part of
the seed, they shall keep a certain number of cows, sheep, and goats,
and reap a third part of the harvest.&nbsp; Thus by less than the tillage
of two acres they pay the rent of one.</p>
<p>There are tenants below the rank of Tacksmen, that have got smaller
tenants under them; for in every place, where money is not the general
equivalent, there must be some whose labour is immediately paid by daily
food.</p>
<p>A country that has no money, is by no means convenient for beggars,
both because such countries are commonly poor, and because charity requires
some trouble and some thought.&nbsp; A penny is easily given upon the
first impulse of compassion, or impatience of importunity; but few will
deliberately search their cupboards or their granaries to find out something
to give.&nbsp; A penny is likewise easily spent, but victuals, if they
are unprepared, require houseroom, and fire, and utensils, which the
beggar knows not where to find.</p>
<p>Yet beggars there sometimes are, who wander from Island to Island.&nbsp;
We had, in our passage to Mull, the company of a woman and her child,
who had exhausted the charity of Col.&nbsp; The arrival of a beggar
on an Island is accounted a sinistrous event.&nbsp; Every body considers
that he shall have the less for what he gives away.&nbsp; Their alms,
I believe, is generally oatmeal.</p>
<p>Near to Col is another Island called Tireye, eminent for its fertility.&nbsp;
Though it has but half the extent of Rum, it is so well peopled, that
there have appeared, not long ago, nine hundred and fourteen at a funeral.&nbsp;
The plenty of this Island enticed beggars to it, who seemed so burdensome
to the inhabitants, that a formal compact was drawn up, by which they
obliged themselves to grant no more relief to casual wanderers, because
they had among them an indigent woman of high birth, whom they considered
as entitled to all that they could spare.&nbsp; I have read the stipulation,
which was indited with juridical formality, but was never made valid
by regular subscription.</p>
<p>If the inhabitants of Col have nothing to give, it is not that they
are oppressed by their landlord: their leases seem to be very profitable.&nbsp;
One farmer, who pays only seven pounds a year, has maintained seven
daughters and three sons, of whom the eldest is educated at Aberdeen
for the ministry; and now, at every vacation, opens a school in Col.</p>
<p>Life is here, in some respects, improved beyond the condition of
some other Islands.&nbsp; In Sky what is wanted can only be bought,
as the arrival of some wandering pedlar may afford an opportunity; but
in Col there is a standing shop, and in Mull there are two.&nbsp; A
shop in the Islands, as in other places of little frequentation, is
a repository of every thing requisite for common use.&nbsp; Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s
journal was filled, and he bought some paper in Col.&nbsp; To a man
that ranges the streets of London, where he is tempted to contrive wants,
for the pleasure of supplying them, a shop affords no image worthy of
attention; but in an Island, it turns the balance of existence between
good and evil.&nbsp; To live in perpetual want of little things, is
a state not indeed of torture, but of constant vexation.&nbsp; I have
in Sky had some difficulty to find ink for a letter; and if a woman
breaks her needle, the work is at a stop.</p>
<p>As it is, the Islanders are obliged to content themselves with succedaneous
means for many common purposes.&nbsp; I have seen the chief man of a
very wide district riding with a halter for a bridle, and governing
his hobby with a wooden curb.</p>
<p>The people of Col, however, do not want dexterity to supply some
of their necessities.&nbsp; Several arts which make trades, and demand
apprenticeships in great cities, are here the practices of daily economy.&nbsp;
In every house candles are made, both moulded and dipped.&nbsp; Their
wicks are small shreds of linen cloth.&nbsp; They all know how to extract
from the Cuddy, oil for their lamps.&nbsp; They all tan skins, and make
brogues.</p>
<p>As we travelled through Sky, we saw many cottages, but they very
frequently stood single on the naked ground.&nbsp; In Col, where the
hills opened a place convenient for habitation, we found a petty village,
of which every hut had a little garden adjoining; thus they made an
appearance of social commerce and mutual offices, and of some attention
to convenience and future supply.&nbsp; There is not in the Western
Islands any collection of buildings that can make pretensions to be
called a town, except in the Isle of Lewis, which I have not seen.</p>
<p>If Lewis is distinguished by a town, Col has also something peculiar.&nbsp;
The young Laird has attempted what no Islander perhaps ever thought
on.&nbsp; He has begun a road capable of a wheel-carriage.&nbsp; He
has carried it about a mile, and will continue it by annual elongation
from his house to the harbour.</p>
<p>Of taxes here is no reason for complaining; they are paid by a very
easy composition.&nbsp; The malt-tax for Col is twenty shillings.&nbsp;
Whisky is very plentiful: there are several stills in the Island, and
more is made than the inhabitants consume.</p>
<p>The great business of insular policy is now to keep the people in
their own country.&nbsp; As the world has been let in upon them, they
have heard of happier climates, and less arbitrary government; and if
they are disgusted, have emissaries among them ready to offer them land
and houses, as a reward for deserting their Chief and clan.&nbsp; Many
have departed both from the main of Scotland, and from the Islands;
and all that go may be considered as subjects lost to the British crown;
for a nation scattered in the boundless regions of America resembles
rays diverging from a focus.&nbsp; All the rays remain, but the heat
is gone.&nbsp; Their power consisted in their concentration: when they
are dispersed, they have no effect.</p>
<p>It may be thought that they are happier by the change; but they are
not happy as a nation, for they are a nation no longer.&nbsp; As they
contribute not to the prosperity of any community, they must want that
security, that dignity, that happiness, whatever it be, which a prosperous
community throws back upon individuals.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Col have not yet learned to be weary of their
heath and rocks, but attend their agriculture and their dairies, without
listening to American seducements.</p>
<p>There are some however who think that this emigration has raised
terrour disproportionate to its real evil; and that it is only a new
mode of doing what was always done.&nbsp; The Highlands, they say, never
maintained their natural inhabitants; but the people, when they found
themselves too numerous, instead of extending cultivation, provided
for themselves by a more compendious method, and sought better fortune
in other countries.&nbsp; They did not indeed go away in collective
bodies, but withdrew invisibly, a few at a time; but the whole number
of fugitives was not less, and the difference between other times and
this, is only the same as between evaporation and effusion.</p>
<p>This is plausible, but I am afraid it is not true.&nbsp; Those who
went before, if they were not sensibly missed, as the argument supposes,
must have gone either in less number, or in a manner less detrimental,
than at present; because formerly there was no complaint.&nbsp; Those
who then left the country were generally the idle dependants on overburdened
families, or men who had no property; and therefore carried away only
themselves.&nbsp; In the present eagerness of emigration, families,
and almost communities, go away together.&nbsp; Those who were considered
as prosperous and wealthy sell their stock and carry away the money.&nbsp;
Once none went away but the useless and poor; in some parts there is
now reason to fear, that none will stay but those who are too poor to
remove themselves, and too useless to be removed at the cost of others.</p>
<p>Of antiquity there is not more knowledge in Col than in other places;
but every where something may be gleaned.</p>
<p>How ladies were portioned, when there was no money, it would be difficult
for an Englishman to guess.&nbsp; In 1649, Maclean of Dronart in Mull
married his sister Fingala to Maclean of Coll, with a hundred and eighty
kine; and stipulated, that if she became a widow, her jointure should
be three hundred and sixty.&nbsp; I suppose some proportionate tract
of land was appropriated to their pasturage.</p>
<p>The disposition to pompous and expensive funerals, which has at one
time or other prevailed in most parts of the civilized world, is not
yet suppressed in the Islands, though some of the ancient solemnities
are worn away, and singers are no longer hired to attend the procession.&nbsp;
Nineteen years ago, at the burial of the Laird of Col, were killed thirty
cows, and about fifty sheep.&nbsp; The number of the cows is positively
told, and we must suppose other victuals in like proportion.</p>
<p>Mr. Maclean informed us of an odd game, of which he did not tell
the original, but which may perhaps be used in other places, where the
reason of it is not yet forgot.&nbsp; At New-year&rsquo;s eve, in the
hall or castle of the Laird, where, at festal seasons, there may be
supposed a very numerous company, one man dresses himself in a cow&rsquo;s
hide, upon which other men beat with sticks.&nbsp; He runs with all
this noise round the house, which all the company quits in a counterfeited
fright: the door is then shut.&nbsp; At New-year&rsquo;s eve there is
no great pleasure to be had out of doors in the Hebrides.&nbsp; They
are sure soon to recover from their terrour enough to solicit for re-admission;
which, for the honour of poetry, is not to be obtained but by repeating
a verse, with which those that are knowing and provident take care to
be furnished.</p>
<p>Very near the house of Maclean stands the castle of Col, which was
the mansion of the Laird, till the house was built.&nbsp; It is built
upon a rock, as Mr. Boswell remarked, that it might not be mined.&nbsp;
It is very strong, and having been not long uninhabited, is yet in repair.&nbsp;
On the wall was, not long ago, a stone with an inscription, importing,
that &lsquo;if any man of the clan of Maclonich shall appear before
this castle, though he come at midnight, with a man&rsquo;s head in
his hand, he shall there find safety and protection against all but
the King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is an old Highland treaty made upon a very memorable occasion.&nbsp;
Maclean, the son of John Gerves, who recovered Col, and conquered Barra,
had obtained, it is said, from James the Second, a grant of the lands
of Lochiel, forfeited, I suppose, by some offence against the state.</p>
<p>Forfeited estates were not in those days quietly resigned; Maclean,
therefore, went with an armed force to seize his new possessions, and,
I know not for what reason, took his wife with him.&nbsp; The Camerons
rose in defence of their Chief, and a battle was fought at the head
of Loch Ness, near the place where Fort Augustus now stands, in which
Lochiel obtained the victory, and Maclean, with his followers, was defeated
and destroyed.</p>
<p>The lady fell into the hands of the conquerours, and being found
pregnant was placed in the custody of Maclonich, one of a tribe or family
branched from Cameron, with orders, if she brought a boy, to destroy
him, if a girl, to spare her.</p>
<p>Maclonich&rsquo;s wife, who was with child likewise, had a girl about
the same time at which lady Maclean brought a boy, and Maclonich with
more generosity to his captive, than fidelity to his trust, contrived
that the children should be changed.</p>
<p>Maclean being thus preserved from death, in time recovered his original
patrimony; and in gratitude to his friend, made his castle a place of
refuge to any of the clan that should think himself in danger; and,
as a proof of reciprocal confidence, Maclean took upon himself and his
posterity the care of educating the heir of Maclonich.</p>
<p>This story, like all other traditions of the Highlands, is variously
related, but though some circumstances are uncertain, the principal
fact is true.&nbsp; Maclean undoubtedly owed his preservation to Maclonich;
for the treaty between the two families has been strictly observed:
it did not sink into disuse and oblivion, but continued in its full
force while the chieftains retained their power.&nbsp; I have read a
demand of protection, made not more than thirty-seven years ago, for
one of the Maclonichs, named Ewen Cameron, who had been accessory to
the death of Macmartin, and had been banished by Lochiel, his lord,
for a certain term; at the expiration of which he returned married from
France, but the Macmartins, not satisfied with the punishment, when
he attempted to settle, still threatened him with vengeance.&nbsp; He
therefore asked, and obtained shelter in the Isle of Col.</p>
<p>The power of protection subsists no longer, but what the law permits
is yet continued, and Maclean of Col now educates the heir of Maclonich.</p>
<p>There still remains in the Islands, though it is passing fast away,
the custom of fosterage.&nbsp; A Laird, a man of wealth and eminence,
sends his child, either male or female, to a tacksman, or tenant, to
be fostered.&nbsp; It is not always his own tenant, but some distant
friend that obtains this honour; for an honour such a trust is very
reasonably thought.&nbsp; The terms of fosterage seem to vary in different
islands.&nbsp; In Mull, the father sends with his child a certain number
of cows, to which the same number is added by the fosterer.&nbsp; The
father appropriates a proportionable extent of ground, without rent,
for their pasturage.&nbsp; If every cow brings a calf, half belongs
to the fosterer, and half to the child; but if there be only one calf
between two cows, it is the child&rsquo;s, and when the child returns
to the parent, it is accompanied by all the cows given, both by the
father and by the fosterer, with half of the increase of the stock by
propagation.&nbsp; These beasts are considered as a portion, and called
Macalive cattle, of which the father has the produce, but is supposed
not to have the full property, but to owe the same number to the child,
as a portion to the daughter, or a stock for the son.</p>
<p>Children continue with the fosterer perhaps six years, and cannot,
where this is the practice, be considered as burdensome.&nbsp; The fosterer,
if he gives four cows, receives likewise four, and has, while the child
continues with him, grass for eight without rent, with half the calves,
and all the milk, for which he pays only four cows when he dismisses
his Dalt, for that is the name for a foster child.</p>
<p>Fosterage is, I believe, sometimes performed upon more liberal terms.&nbsp;
Our friend, the young Laird of Col, was fostered by Macsweyn of Grissipol.&nbsp;
Macsweyn then lived a tenant to Sir James Macdonald in the Isle of Sky;
and therefore Col, whether he sent him cattle or not, could grant him
no land.&nbsp; The Dalt, however, at his return, brought back a considerable
number of Macalive cattle, and of the friendship so formed there have
been good effects.&nbsp; When Macdonald raised his rents, Macsweyn was,
like other tenants, discontented, and, resigning his farm, removed from
Sky to Col, and was established at Grissipol.</p>
<p>These observations we made by favour of the contrary wind that drove
us to Col, an Island not often visited; for there is not much to amuse
curiosity, or to attract avarice.</p>
<p>The ground has been hitherto, I believe, used chiefly for pasturage.&nbsp;
In a district, such as the eye can command, there is a general herdsman,
who knows all the cattle of the neighbourhood, and whose station is
upon a hill, from which he surveys the lower grounds; and if one man&rsquo;s
cattle invade another&rsquo;s grass, drives them back to their own borders.&nbsp;
But other means of profit begin to be found; kelp is gathered and burnt,
and sloops are loaded with the concreted ashes.&nbsp; Cultivation is
likely to be improved by the skill and encouragement of the present
heir, and the inhabitants of those obscure vallies will partake of the
general progress of life.</p>
<p>The rents of the parts which belong to the Duke of Argyle, have been
raised from fifty-five to one hundred and five pounds, whether from
the land or the sea I cannot tell.&nbsp; The bounties of the sea have
lately been so great, that a farm in Southuist has risen in ten years
from a rent of thirty pounds to one hundred and eighty.</p>
<p>He who lives in Col, and finds himself condemned to solitary meals,
and incommunicable reflection, will find the usefulness of that middle
order of Tacksmen, which some who applaud their own wisdom are wishing
to destroy.&nbsp; Without intelligence man is not social, he is only
gregarious; and little intelligence will there be, where all are constrained
to daily labour, and every mind must wait upon the hand.</p>
<p>After having listened for some days to the tempest, and wandered
about the Island till our curiosity was satisfied, we began to think
about our departure.&nbsp; To leave Col in October was not very easy.&nbsp;
We however found a sloop which lay on the coast to carry kelp; and for
a price which we thought levied upon our necessities, the master agreed
to carry us to Mull, whence we might readily pass back to Scotland.</p>
<h2>MULL</h2>
<p>As we were to catch the first favourable breath, we spent the night
not very elegantly nor pleasantly in the vessel, and were landed next
day at Tobor Morar, a port in Mull, which appears to an unexperienced
eye formed for the security of ships; for its mouth is closed by a small
island, which admits them through narrow channels into a bason sufficiently
capacious.&nbsp; They are indeed safe from the sea, but there is a hollow
between the mountains, through which the wind issues from the land with
very mischievous violence.</p>
<p>There was no danger while we were there, and we found several other
vessels at anchor; so that the port had a very commercial appearance.</p>
<p>The young Laird of Col, who had determined not to let us lose his
company, while there was any difficulty remaining, came over with us.&nbsp;
His influence soon appeared; for he procured us horses, and conducted
us to the house of Doctor Maclean, where we found very kind entertainment,
and very pleasing conversation.&nbsp; Miss Maclean, who was born, and
had been bred at Glasgow, having removed with her father to Mull, added
to other qualifications, a great knowledge of the Earse language, which
she had not learned in her childhood, but gained by study, and was the
only interpreter of Earse poetry that I could ever find.</p>
<p>The Isle of Mull is perhaps in extent the third of the Hebrides.&nbsp;
It is not broken by waters, nor shot into promontories, but is a solid
and compact mass, of breadth nearly equal to its length.&nbsp; Of the
dimensions of the larger Islands, there is no knowledge approaching
to exactness.&nbsp; I am willing to estimate it as containing about
three hundred square miles.</p>
<p>Mull had suffered like Sky by the black winter of seventy-one, in
which, contrary to all experience, a continued frost detained the snow
eight weeks upon the ground.&nbsp; Against a calamity never known, no
provision had been made, and the people could only pine in helpless
misery.&nbsp; One tenant was mentioned, whose cattle perished to the
value of three hundred pounds; a loss which probably more than the life
of man is necessary to repair.&nbsp; In countries like these, the descriptions
of famine become intelligible.&nbsp; Where by vigorous and artful cultivation
of a soil naturally fertile, there is commonly a superfluous growth
both of grain and grass; where the fields are crowded with cattle; and
where every hand is able to attract wealth from a distance, by making
something that promotes ease, or gratifies vanity, a dear year produces
only a comparative want, which is rather seen than felt, and which terminates
commonly in no worse effect, than that of condemning the lower orders
of the community to sacrifice a little luxury to convenience, or at
most a little convenience to necessity.</p>
<p>But where the climate is unkind, and the ground penurious, so that
the most fruitful years will produce only enough to maintain themselves;
where life unimproved, and unadorned, fades into something little more
than naked existence, and every one is busy for himself, without any
arts by which the pleasure of others may be increased; if to the daily
burden of distress any additional weight be added, nothing remains but
to despair and die.&nbsp; In Mull the disappointment of a harvest, or
a murrain among the cattle, cuts off the regular provision; and they
who have no manufactures can purchase no part of the superfluities of
other countries.&nbsp; The consequence of a bad season is here not scarcity,
but emptiness; and they whose plenty, was barely a supply of natural
and present need, when that slender stock fails, must perish with hunger.</p>
<p>All travel has its advantages.&nbsp; If the passenger visits better
countries, he may learn to improve his own, and if fortune carries him
to worse, he may learn to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s curiosity strongly impelled him to survey Iona,
or Icolmkil, which was to the early ages the great school of Theology,
and is supposed to have been the place of sepulture for the ancient
kings.&nbsp; I, though less eager, did not oppose him.</p>
<p>That we might perform this expedition, it was necessary to traverse
a great part of Mull.&nbsp; We passed a day at Dr. Maclean&rsquo;s,
and could have been well contented to stay longer.&nbsp; But Col provided
us horses, and we pursued our journey.&nbsp; This was a day of inconvenience,
for the country is very rough, and my horse was but little.&nbsp; We
travelled many hours through a tract, black and barren, in which, however,
there were the reliques of humanity; for we found a ruined chapel in
our way.</p>
<p>It is natural, in traversing this gloom of desolation, to inquire,
whether something may not be done to give nature a more cheerful face,
and whether those hills and moors that afford heath cannot with a little
care and labour bear something better?&nbsp; The first thought that
occurs is to cover them with trees, for that in many of these naked
regions trees will grow, is evident, because stumps and roots are yet
remaining; and the speculatist hastily proceeds to censure that negligence
and laziness that has omitted for so long a time so easy an improvement.</p>
<p>To drop seeds into the ground, and attend their growth, requires
little labour and no skill.&nbsp; He who remembers that all the woods,
by which the wants of man have been supplied from the Deluge till now,
were self-sown, will not easily be persuaded to think all the art and
preparation necessary, which the Georgick writers prescribe to planters.&nbsp;
Trees certainly have covered the earth with very little culture.&nbsp;
They wave their tops among the rocks of Norway, and might thrive as
well in the Highlands and Hebrides.</p>
<p>But there is a frightful interval between the seed and timber.&nbsp;
He that calculates the growth of trees, has the unwelcome remembrance
of the shortness of life driven hard upon him.&nbsp; He knows that he
is doing what will never benefit himself; and when he rejoices to see
the stem rise, is disposed to repine that another shall cut it down.</p>
<p>Plantation is naturally the employment of a mind unburdened with
care, and vacant to futurity, saturated with present good, and at leisure
to derive gratification from the prospect of posterity.&nbsp; He that
pines with hunger, is in little care how others shall be fed.&nbsp;
The poor man is seldom studious to make his grandson rich.&nbsp; It
may be soon discovered, why in a place, which hardly supplies the cravings
of necessity, there has been little attention to the delights of fancy,
and why distant convenience is unregarded, where the thoughts are turned
with incessant solicitude upon every possibility of immediate advantage.</p>
<p>Neither is it quite so easy to raise large woods, as may be conceived.&nbsp;
Trees intended to produce timber must be sown where they are to grow;
and ground sown with trees must be kept useless for a long time, inclosed
at an expence from which many will be discouraged by the remoteness
of the profit, and watched with that attention, which, in places where
it is most needed, will neither be given nor bought.&nbsp; That it cannot
be plowed is evident; and if cattle be suffered to graze upon it, they
will devour the plants as fast as they rise.&nbsp; Even in coarser countries,
where herds and flocks are not fed, not only the deer and the wild goats
will browse upon them, but the hare and rabbit will nibble them.&nbsp;
It is therefore reasonable to believe, what I do not remember any naturalist
to have remarked, that there was a time when the world was very thinly
inhabited by beasts, as well as men, and that the woods had leisure
to rise high before animals had bred numbers sufficient to intercept
them.</p>
<p>Sir James Macdonald, in part of the wastes of his territory, set
or sowed trees, to the number, as I have been told, of several millions,
expecting, doubtless, that they would grow up into future navies and
cities; but for want of inclosure, and of that care which is always
necessary, and will hardly ever be taken, all his cost and labour have
been lost, and the ground is likely to continue an useless heath.</p>
<p>Having not any experience of a journey in Mull, we had no doubt of
reaching the sea by day-light, and therefore had not left Dr. Maclean&rsquo;s
very early.&nbsp; We travelled diligently enough, but found the country,
for road there was none, very difficult to pass.&nbsp; We were always
struggling with some obstruction or other, and our vexation was not
balanced by any gratification of the eye or mind.&nbsp; We were now
long enough acquainted with hills and heath to have lost the emotion
that they once raised, whether pleasing or painful, and had our mind
employed only on our own fatigue.&nbsp; We were however sure, under
Col&rsquo;s protection, of escaping all real evils.&nbsp; There was
no house in Mull to which he could not introduce us.&nbsp; He had intended
to lodge us, for that night, with a gentleman that lived upon the coast,
but discovered on the way, that he then lay in bed without hope of life.</p>
<p>We resolved not to embarrass a family, in a time of so much sorrow,
if any other expedient could he found; and as the Island of Ulva was
over-against us, it was determined that we should pass the strait and
have recourse to the Laird, who, like the other gentlemen of the Islands,
was known to Col.&nbsp; We expected to find a ferry-boat, but when at
last we came to the water, the boat was gone.</p>
<p>We were now again at a stop.&nbsp; It was the sixteenth of October,
a time when it is not convenient to sleep in the Hebrides without a
cover, and there was no house within our reach, but that which we had
already declined.</p>
<h2>ULVA</h2>
<p>While we stood deliberating, we were happily espied from an Irish
ship, that lay at anchor in the strait.&nbsp; The master saw that we
wanted a passage, and with great civility sent us his boat, which quickly
conveyed us to Ulva, where we were very liberally entertained by Mr.
Macquarry.</p>
<p>To Ulva we came in the dark, and left it before noon the next day.&nbsp;
A very exact description therefore will not be expected.&nbsp; We were
told, that it is an Island of no great extent, rough and barren, inhabited
by the Macquarrys; a clan not powerful nor numerous, but of antiquity,
which most other families are content to reverence.&nbsp; The name is
supposed to be a depravation of some other; for the Earse language does
not afford it any etymology.&nbsp; Macquarry is proprietor both of Ulva
and some adjacent Islands, among which is Staffa, so lately raised to
renown by Mr. Banks.</p>
<p>When the Islanders were reproached with their ignorance, or insensibility
of the wonders of Staffa, they had not much to reply.&nbsp; They had
indeed considered it little, because they had always seen it; and none
but philosophers, nor they always, are struck with wonder, otherwise
than by novelty.&nbsp; How would it surprise an unenlightened ploughman,
to hear a company of sober men, inquiring by what power the hand tosses
a stone, or why the stone, when it is tossed, falls to the ground!</p>
<p>Of the ancestors of Macquarry, who thus lies hid in his unfrequented
Island, I have found memorials in all places where they could be expected.</p>
<p>Inquiring after the reliques of former manners, I found that in Ulva,
and, I think, no where else, is continued the payment of the Mercheta
Mulierum; a fine in old times due to the Laird at the marriage of a
virgin.&nbsp; The original of this claim, as of our tenure of Borough
English, is variously delivered.&nbsp; It is pleasant to find ancient
customs in old families.&nbsp; This payment, like others, was, for want
of money, made anciently in the produce of the land.&nbsp; Macquarry
was used to demand a sheep, for which he now takes a crown, by that
inattention to the uncertain proportion between the value and the denomination
of money, which has brought much disorder into Europe.&nbsp; A sheep
has always the same power of supplying human wants, but a crown will
bring at one time more, at another less.</p>
<p>Ulva was not neglected by the piety of ardent times: it has still
to show what was once a church.</p>
<h2>INCH KENNETH</h2>
<p>In the morning we went again into the boat, and were landed on Inch
Kenneth, an Island about a mile long, and perhaps half a mile broad,
remarkable for pleasantness and fertility.&nbsp; It is verdant and grassy,
and fit both for pasture and tillage; but it has no trees.&nbsp; Its
only inhabitants were Sir Allan Maclean and two young ladies, his daughters,
with their servants.</p>
<p>Romance does not often exhibit a scene that strikes the imagination
more than this little desert in these depths of Western obscurity, occupied
not by a gross herdsman, or amphibious fisherman, but by a gentleman
and two ladies, of high birth, polished manners and elegant conversation,
who, in a habitation raised not very far above the ground, but furnished
with unexpected neatness and convenience, practised all the kindness
of hospitality, and refinement of courtesy.</p>
<p>Sir Allan is the Chieftain of the great clan of Maclean, which is
said to claim the second place among the Highland families, yielding
only to Macdonald.&nbsp; Though by the misconduct of his ancestors,
most of the extensive territory, which would have descended to him,
has been alienated, he still retains much of the dignity and authority
of his birth.&nbsp; When soldiers were lately wanting for the American
war, application was made to Sir Allan, and he nominated a hundred men
for the service, who obeyed the summons, and bore arms under his command.</p>
<p>He had then, for some time, resided with the young ladies in Inch
Kenneth, where he lives not only with plenty, but with elegance, having
conveyed to his cottage a collection of books, and what else is necessary
to make his hours pleasant.</p>
<p>When we landed, we were met by Sir Allan and the Ladies, accompanied
by Miss Macquarry, who had passed some time with them, and now returned
to Ulva with her father.</p>
<p>We all walked together to the mansion, where we found one cottage
for Sir Allan, and I think two more for the domesticks and the offices.&nbsp;
We entered, and wanted little that palaces afford.&nbsp; Our room was
neatly floored, and well lighted; and our dinner, which was dressed
in one of the other huts, was plentiful and delicate.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Sir Allan reminded us, that the day was Sunday,
which he never suffered to pass without some religious distinction,
and invited us to partake in his acts of domestick worship; which I
hope neither Mr. Boswell nor myself will be suspected of a disposition
to refuse.&nbsp; The elder of the Ladies read the English service.</p>
<p>Inch Kenneth was once a seminary of ecclesiasticks, subordinate,
I suppose, to Icolmkill.&nbsp; Sir Allan had a mind to trace the foundations
of the college, but neither I nor Mr. Boswell, who bends a keener eye
on vacancy, were able to perceive them.</p>
<p>Our attention, however, was sufficiently engaged by a venerable chapel,
which stands yet entire, except that the roof is gone.&nbsp; It is about
sixty feet in length, and thirty in breadth.&nbsp; On one side of the
altar is a bas relief of the blessed Virgin, and by it lies a little
bell; which, though cracked, and without a clapper, has remained there
for ages, guarded only by the venerableness of the place.&nbsp; The
ground round the chapel is covered with gravestones of Chiefs and ladies;
and still continues to be a place of sepulture.</p>
<p>Inch Kenneth is a proper prelude to Icolmkill.&nbsp; It was not without
some mournful emotion that we contemplated the ruins of religious structures
and the monuments of the dead.</p>
<p>On the next day we took a more distinct view of the place, and went
with the boat to see oysters in the bed, out of which the boatmen forced
up as many as were wanted.&nbsp; Even Inch Kenneth has a subordinate
Island, named Sandiland, I suppose in contempt, where we landed, and
found a rock, with a surface of perhaps four acres, of which one is
naked stone, another spread with sand and shells, some of which I picked
up for their glossy beauty, and two covered with a little earth and
grass, on which Sir Allan has a few sheep.&nbsp; I doubt not but when
there was a college at Inch Kenneth, there was a hermitage upon Sandiland.</p>
<p>Having wandered over those extensive plains, we committed ourselves
again to the winds and waters; and after a voyage of about ten minutes,
in which we met with nothing very observable, were again safe upon dry
ground.</p>
<p>We told Sir Allan our desire of visiting Icolmkill, and entreated
him to give us his protection, and his company.&nbsp; He thought proper
to hesitate a little, but the Ladies hinted, that as they knew he would
not finally refuse, he would do better if he preserved the grace of
ready compliance.&nbsp; He took their advice, and promised to carry
us on the morrow in his boat.</p>
<p>We passed the remaining part of the day in such amusements as were
in our power.&nbsp; Sir Allan related the American campaign, and at
evening one of the Ladies played on her harpsichord, while Col and Mr.
Boswell danced a Scottish reel with the other.</p>
<p>We could have been easily persuaded to a longer stay upon Inch Kenneth,
but life will not be all passed in delight.&nbsp; The session at Edinburgh
was approaching, from which Mr. Boswell could not be absent.</p>
<p>In the morning our boat was ready: it was high and strong.&nbsp;
Sir Allan victualled it for the day, and provided able rowers.&nbsp;
We now parted from the young Laird of Col, who had treated us with so
much kindness, and concluded his favours by consigning us to Sir Allan.&nbsp;
Here we had the last embrace of this amiable man, who, while these pages
were preparing to attest his virtues, perished in the passage between
Ulva and Inch Kenneth.</p>
<p>Sir Allan, to whom the whole region was well known, told us of a
very remarkable cave, to which he would show us the way.&nbsp; We had
been disappointed already by one cave, and were not much elevated by
the expectation of another.</p>
<p>It was yet better to see it, and we stopped at some rocks on the
coast of Mull.&nbsp; The mouth is fortified by vast fragments of stone,
over which we made our way, neither very nimbly, nor very securely.&nbsp;
The place, however, well repaid our trouble.&nbsp; The bottom, as far
as the flood rushes in, was encumbered with large pebbles, but as we
advanced was spread over with smooth sand.&nbsp; The breadth is about
forty-five feet: the roof rises in an arch, almost regular, to a height
which we could not measure; but I think it about thirty feet.</p>
<p>This part of our curiosity was nearly frustrated; for though we went
to see a cave, and knew that caves are dark, we forgot to carry tapers,
and did not discover our omission till we were wakened by our wants.&nbsp;
Sir Allan then sent one of the boatmen into the country, who soon returned
with one little candle.&nbsp; We were thus enabled to go forward, but
could not venture far.&nbsp; Having passed inward from the sea to a
great depth, we found on the right hand a narrow passage, perhaps not
more than six feet wide, obstructed by great stones, over which we climbed
and came into a second cave, in breadth twenty-five feet.&nbsp; The
air in this apartment was very warm, but not oppressive, nor loaded
with vapours.&nbsp; Our light showed no tokens of a feculent or corrupted
atmosphere.&nbsp; Here was a square stone, called, as we are told, Fingal&rsquo;s
Table.</p>
<p>If we had been provided with torches, we should have proceeded in
our search, though we had already gone as far as any former adventurer,
except some who are reported never to have returned; and, measuring
our way back, we found it more than a hundred and sixty yards, the eleventh
part of a mile.</p>
<p>Our measures were not critically exact, having been made with a walking
pole, such as it is convenient to carry in these rocky countries, of
which I guessed the length by standing against it.&nbsp; In this there
could be no great errour, nor do I much doubt but the Highlander, whom
we employed, reported the number right.&nbsp; More nicety however is
better, and no man should travel unprovided with instruments for taking
heights and distances.</p>
<p>There is yet another cause of errour not always easily surmounted,
though more dangerous to the veracity of itinerary narratives, than
imperfect mensuration.&nbsp; An observer deeply impressed by any remarkable
spectacle, does not suppose, that the traces will soon vanish from his
mind, and having commonly no great convenience for writing, defers the
description to a time of more leisure, and better accommodation.</p>
<p>He who has not made the experiment, or who is not accustomed to require
rigorous accuracy from himself, will scarcely believe how much a few
hours take from certainty of knowledge, and distinctness of imagery;
how the succession of objects will be broken, how separate parts will
be confused, and how many particular features and discriminations will
be compressed and conglobated into one gross and general idea.</p>
<p>To this dilatory notation must be imputed the false relations of
travellers, where there is no imaginable motive to deceive.&nbsp; They
trusted to memory, what cannot be trusted safely but to the eye, and
told by guess what a few hours before they had known with certainty.&nbsp;
Thus it was that Wheeler and Spon described with irreconcilable contrariety
things which they surveyed together, and which both undoubtedly designed
to show as they saw them.</p>
<p>When we had satisfied our curiosity in the cave, so far as our penury
of light permitted us, we clambered again to our boat, and proceeded
along the coast of Mull to a headland, called Atun, remarkable for the
columnar form of the rocks, which rise in a series of pilasters, with
a degree of regularity, which Sir Allan thinks not less worthy of curiosity
than the shore of Staffa.</p>
<p>Not long after we came to another range of black rocks, which had
the appearance of broken pilasters, set one behind another to a great
depth.&nbsp; This place was chosen by Sir Allan for our dinner.&nbsp;
We were easily accommodated with seats, for the stones were of all heights,
and refreshed ourselves and our boatmen, who could have no other rest
till we were at Icolmkill.</p>
<p>The evening was now approaching, and we were yet at a considerable
distance from the end of our expedition.&nbsp; We could therefore stop
no more to make remarks in the way, but set forward with some degree
of eagerness.&nbsp; The day soon failed us, and the moon presented a
very solemn and pleasing scene.&nbsp; The sky was clear, so that the
eye commanded a wide circle: the sea was neither still nor turbulent:
the wind neither silent nor loud.&nbsp; We were never far from one coast
or another, on which, if the weather had become violent, we could have
found shelter, and therefore contemplated at ease the region through
which we glided in the tranquillity of the night, and saw now a rock
and now an island grow gradually conspicuous and gradually obscure.&nbsp;
I committed the fault which I have just been censuring, in neglecting,
as we passed, to note the series of this placid navigation.</p>
<p>We were very near an Island, called Nun&rsquo;s Island, perhaps from
an ancient convent.&nbsp; Here is said to have been dug the stone that
was used in the buildings of Icolmkill.&nbsp; Whether it is now inhabited
we could not stay to inquire.</p>
<p>At last we came to Icolmkill, but found no convenience for landing.&nbsp;
Our boat could not be forced very near the dry ground, and our Highlanders
carried us over the water.</p>
<p>We were now treading that illustrious Island, which was once the
luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence savage clans and roving barbarians
derived the benefits of knowledge, and the blessings of religion.&nbsp;
To abstract the mind from all local emotion would be impossible, if
it were endeavoured, and would be foolish, if it were possible.&nbsp;
Whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses; whatever makes the
past, the distant, or the future predominate over the present, advances
us in the dignity of thinking beings.&nbsp; Far from me and from my
friends, be such frigid philosophy as may conduct us indifferent and
unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by wisdom, bravery,
or virtue.&nbsp; That man is little to be envied, whose patriotism would
not gain force upon the plain of Marathon, or whose piety would not
grow warmer among the ruins of Iona!</p>
<p>We came too late to visit monuments: some care was necessary for
ourselves.&nbsp; Whatever was in the Island, Sir Allan could command,
for the inhabitants were Macleans; but having little they could not
give us much.&nbsp; He went to the headman of the Island, whom Fame,
but Fame delights in amplifying, represents as worth no less than fifty
pounds.&nbsp; He was perhaps proud enough of his guests, but ill prepared
for our entertainment; however, he soon produced more provision than
men not luxurious require.&nbsp; Our lodging was next to be provided.&nbsp;
We found a barn well stocked with hay, and made our beds as soft as
we could.</p>
<p>In the morning we rose and surveyed the place.&nbsp; The churches
of the two convents are both standing, though unroofed.&nbsp; They were
built of unhewn stone, but solid, and not inelegant.&nbsp; I brought
away rude measures of the buildings, such as I cannot much trust myself,
inaccurately taken, and obscurely noted.&nbsp; Mr. Pennant&rsquo;s delineations,
which are doubtless exact, have made my unskilful description less necessary.</p>
<p>The episcopal church consists of two parts, separated by the belfry,
and built at different times.&nbsp; The original church had, like others,
the altar at one end, and tower at the other: but as it grew too small,
another building of equal dimension was added, and the tower then was
necessarily in the middle.</p>
<p>That these edifices are of different ages seems evident.&nbsp; The
arch of the first church is Roman, being part of a circle; that of the
additional building is pointed, and therefore Gothick, or Saracenical;
the tower is firm, and wants only to be floored and covered.</p>
<p>Of the chambers or cells belonging to the monks, there are some walls
remaining, but nothing approaching to a complete apartment.</p>
<p>The bottom of the church is so incumbered with mud and rubbish, that
we could make no discoveries of curious inscriptions, and what there
are have been already published.&nbsp; The place is said to be known
where the black stones lie concealed, on which the old Highland Chiefs,
when they made contracts and alliances, used to take the oath, which
was considered as more sacred than any other obligation, and which could
not be violated without the blackest infamy.&nbsp; In those days of
violence and rapine, it was of great importance to impress upon savage
minds the sanctity of an oath, by some particular and extraordinary
circumstances.&nbsp; They would not have recourse to the black stones,
upon small or common occasions, and when they had established their
faith by this tremendous sanction, inconstancy and treachery were no
longer feared.</p>
<p>The chapel of the nunnery is now used by the inhabitants as a kind
of general cow-house, and the bottom is consequently too miry for examination.&nbsp;
Some of the stones which covered the later abbesses have inscriptions,
which might yet be read, if the chapel were cleansed.&nbsp; The roof
of this, as of all the other buildings, is totally destroyed, not only
because timber quickly decays when it is neglected, but because in an
island utterly destitute of wood, it was wanted for use, and was consequently
the first plunder of needy rapacity.</p>
<p>The chancel of the nuns&rsquo; chapel is covered with an arch of
stone, to which time has done no injury; and a small apartment communicating
with the choir, on the north side, like the chapter-house in cathedrals,
roofed with stone in the same manner, is likewise entire.</p>
<p>In one of the churches was a marble altar, which the superstition
of the inhabitants has destroyed.&nbsp; Their opinion was, that a fragment
of this stone was a defence against shipwrecks, fire, and miscarriages.&nbsp;
In one corner of the church the bason for holy water is yet unbroken.</p>
<p>The cemetery of the nunnery was, till very lately, regarded with
such reverence, that only women were buried in it.&nbsp; These reliques
of veneration always produce some mournful pleasure.&nbsp; I could have
forgiven a great injury more easily than the violation of this imaginary
sanctity.</p>
<p>South of the chapel stand the walls of a large room, which was probably
the hall, or refectory of the nunnery.&nbsp; This apartment is capable
of repair.&nbsp; Of the rest of the convent there are only fragments.</p>
<p>Besides the two principal churches, there are, I think, five chapels
yet standing, and three more remembered.&nbsp; There are also crosses,
of which two bear the names of St. John and St. Matthew.</p>
<p>A large space of ground about these consecrated edifices is covered
with gravestones, few of which have any inscription.&nbsp; He that surveys
it, attended by an insular antiquary, may be told where the Kings of
many nations are buried, and if he loves to sooth his imagination with
the thoughts that naturally rise in places where the great and the powerful
lie mingled with the dust, let him listen in submissive silence; for
if he asks any questions, his delight is at an end.</p>
<p>Iona has long enjoyed, without any very credible attestation, the
honour of being reputed the cemetery of the Scottish Kings.&nbsp; It
is not unlikely, that, when the opinion of local sanctity was prevalent,
the Chieftains of the Isles, and perhaps some of the Norwegian or Irish
princes were reposited in this venerable enclosure.&nbsp; But by whom
the subterraneous vaults are peopled is now utterly unknown.&nbsp; The
graves are very numerous, and some of them undoubtedly contain the remains
of men, who did not expect to be so soon forgotten.</p>
<p>Not far from this awful ground, may be traced the garden of the monastery:
the fishponds are yet discernible, and the aqueduct, which supplied
them, is still in use.</p>
<p>There remains a broken building, which is called the Bishop&rsquo;s
house, I know not by what authority.&nbsp; It was once the residence
of some man above the common rank, for it has two stories and a chimney.&nbsp;
We were shewn a chimney at the other end, which was only a nich, without
perforation, but so much does antiquarian credulity, or patriotick vanity
prevail, that it was not much more safe to trust the eye of our instructor
than the memory.</p>
<p>There is in the Island one house more, and only one, that has a chimney:
we entered it, and found it neither wanting repair nor inhabitants;
but to the farmers, who now possess it, the chimney is of no great value;
for their fire was made on the floor, in the middle of the room, and
notwithstanding the dignity of their mansion, they rejoiced, like their
neighbours, in the comforts of smoke.</p>
<p>It is observed, that ecclesiastical colleges are always in the most
pleasant and fruitful places.&nbsp; While the world allowed the monks
their choice, it is surely no dishonour that they chose well.&nbsp;
This Island is remarkably fruitful.&nbsp; The village near the churches
is said to contain seventy families, which, at five in a family, is
more than a hundred inhabitants to a mile.&nbsp; There are perhaps other
villages: yet both corn and cattle are annually exported.</p>
<p>But the fruitfulness of Iona is now its whole prosperity.&nbsp; The
inhabitants are remarkably gross, and remarkably neglected: I know not
if they are visited by any Minister.&nbsp; The Island, which was once
the metropolis of learning and piety, has now no school for education,
nor temple for worship, only two inhabitants that can speak English,
and not one that can write or read.</p>
<p>The people are of the clan of Maclean; and though Sir Allan had not
been in the place for many years, he was received with all the reverence
due to their Chieftain.&nbsp; One of them being sharply reprehended
by him, for not sending him some rum, declared after his departure,
in Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s presence, that he had no design of disappointing
him, &lsquo;for,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I would cut my bones for him;
and if he had sent his dog for it, he should have had it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When we were to depart, our boat was left by the ebb at a great distance
from the water, but no sooner did we wish it afloat, than the islanders
gathered round it, and, by the union of many hands, pushed it down the
beach; every man who could contribute his help seemed to think himself
happy in the opportunity of being, for a moment, useful to his Chief.</p>
<p>We now left those illustrious ruins, by which Mr. Boswell was much
affected, nor would I willingly be thought to have looked upon them
without some emotion.&nbsp; Perhaps, in the revolutions of the world,
Iona may be sometime again the instructress of the Western Regions.</p>
<p>It was no long voyage to Mull, where, under Sir Allan&rsquo;s protection,
we landed in the evening, and were entertained for the night by Mr.
Maclean, a Minister that lives upon the coast, whose elegance of conversation,
and strength of judgment, would make him conspicuous in places of greater
celebrity.&nbsp; Next day we dined with Dr. Maclean, another physician,
and then travelled on to the house of a very powerful Laird, Maclean
of Lochbuy; for in this country every man&rsquo;s name is Maclean.</p>
<p>Where races are thus numerous, and thus combined, none but the Chief
of a clan is addressed by his name.&nbsp; The Laird of Dunvegan is called
Macleod, but other gentlemen of the same family are denominated by the
places where they reside, as Raasa, or Talisker.&nbsp; The distinction
of the meaner people is made by their Christian names.&nbsp; In consequence
of this practice, the late Laird of Macfarlane, an eminent genealogist,
considered himself as disrespectfully treated, if the common addition
was applied to him.&nbsp; Mr. Macfarlane, said he, may with equal propriety
be said to many; but I, and I only, am Macfarlane.</p>
<p>Our afternoon journey was through a country of such gloomy desolation,
that Mr. Boswell thought no part of the Highlands equally terrifick,
yet we came without any difficulty, at evening, to Lochbuy, where we
found a true Highland Laird, rough and haughty, and tenacious of his
dignity; who, hearing my name, inquired whether I was of the Johnstons
of Glencroe, or of Ardnamurchan.</p>
<p>Lochbuy has, like the other insular Chieftains, quitted the castle
that sheltered his ancestors, and lives near it, in a mansion not very
spacious or splendid.&nbsp; I have seen no houses in the Islands much
to be envied for convenience or magnificence, yet they bare testimony
to the progress of arts and civility, as they shew that rapine and surprise
are no longer dreaded, and are much more commodious than the ancient
fortresses.</p>
<p>The castles of the Hebrides, many of which are standing, and many
ruined, were always built upon points of land, on the margin of the
sea.&nbsp; For the choice of this situation there must have been some
general reason, which the change of manners has left in obscurity.&nbsp;
They were of no use in the days of piracy, as defences of the coast;
for it was equally accessible in other places.&nbsp; Had they been sea-marks
or light-houses, they would have been of more use to the invader than
the natives, who could want no such directions of their own waters:
for a watch-tower, a cottage on a hill would have been better, as it
would have commanded a wider view.</p>
<p>If they be considered merely as places of retreat, the situation
seems not well chosen; for the Laird of an Island is safest from foreign
enemies in the center; on the coast he might be more suddenly surprised
than in the inland parts; and the invaders, if their enterprise miscarried,
might more easily retreat.&nbsp; Some convenience, however, whatever
it was, their position on the shore afforded; for uniformity of practice
seldom continues long without good reason.</p>
<p>A castle in the Islands is only a single tower of three or four stories,
of which the walls are sometimes eight or nine feet thick, with narrow
windows, and close winding stairs of stone.&nbsp; The top rises in a
cone, or pyramid of stone, encompassed by battlements.&nbsp; The intermediate
floors are sometimes frames of timber, as in common houses, and sometimes
arches of stone, or alternately stone and timber; so that there was
very little danger from fire.&nbsp; In the center of every floor, from
top to bottom, is the chief room, of no great extent, round which there
are narrow cavities, or recesses, formed by small vacuities, or by a
double wall.&nbsp; I know not whether there be ever more than one fire-place.&nbsp;
They had not capacity to contain many people, or much provision; but
their enemies could seldom stay to blockade them; for if they failed
in the first attack, their next care was to escape.</p>
<p>The walls were always too strong to be shaken by such desultory hostilities;
the windows were too narrow to be entered, and the battlements too high
to be scaled.&nbsp; The only danger was at the gates, over which the
wall was built with a square cavity, not unlike a chimney, continued
to the top.&nbsp; Through this hollow the defendants let fall stones
upon those who attempted to break the gate, and poured down water, perhaps
scalding water, if the attack was made with fire.&nbsp; The castle of
Lochbuy was secured by double doors, of which the outer was an iron
grate.</p>
<p>In every castle is a well and a dungeon.&nbsp; The use of the well
is evident.&nbsp; The dungeon is a deep subterraneous cavity, walled
on the sides, and arched on the top, into which the descent is through
a narrow door, by a ladder or a rope, so that it seems impossible to
escape, when the rope or ladder is drawn up.&nbsp; The dungeon was,
I suppose, in war, a prison for such captives as were treated with severity,
and, in peace, for such delinquents as had committed crimes within the
Laird&rsquo;s jurisdiction; for the mansions of many Lairds were, till
the late privation of their privileges, the halls of justice to their
own tenants.</p>
<p>As these fortifications were the productions of mere necessity, they
are built only for safety, with little regard to convenience, and with
none to elegance or pleasure.&nbsp; It was sufficient for a Laird of
the Hebrides, if he had a strong house, in which he could hide his wife
and children from the next clan.&nbsp; That they are not large nor splendid
is no wonder.&nbsp; It is not easy to find how they were raised, such
as they are, by men who had no money, in countries where the labourers
and artificers could scarcely be fed.&nbsp; The buildings in different
parts of the Island shew their degrees of wealth and power.&nbsp; I
believe that for all the castles which I have seen beyond the Tweed,
the ruins yet remaining of some one of those which the English built
in Wales, would supply materials.</p>
<p>These castles afford another evidence that the fictions of romantick
chivalry had for their basis the real manners of the feudal times, when
every Lord of a seignory lived in his hold lawless and unaccountable,
with all the licentiousness and insolence of uncontested superiority
and unprincipled power.&nbsp; The traveller, whoever he might be, coming
to the fortified habitation of a Chieftain, would, probably, have been
interrogated from the battlements, admitted with caution at the gate,
introduced to a petty Monarch, fierce with habitual hostility, and vigilant
with ignorant suspicion; who, according to his general temper, or accidental
humour, would have seated a stranger as his guest at the table, or as
a spy confined him in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Lochbuy means the Yellow Lake, which is the name given to an inlet
of the sea, upon which the castle of Mr. Maclean stands.&nbsp; The reason
of the appellation we did not learn.</p>
<p>We were now to leave the Hebrides, where we had spent some weeks
with sufficient amusement, and where we had amplified our thoughts with
new scenes of nature, and new modes of life.&nbsp; More time would have
given us a more distinct view, but it was necessary that Mr. Boswell
should return before the courts of justice were opened; and it was not
proper to live too long upon hospitality, however liberally imparted.</p>
<p>Of these Islands it must be confessed, that they have not many allurements,
but to the mere lover of naked nature.&nbsp; The inhabitants are thin,
provisions are scarce, and desolation and penury give little pleasure.</p>
<p>The people collectively considered are not few, though their numbers
are small in proportion to the space which they occupy.&nbsp; Mull is
said to contain six thousand, and Sky fifteen thousand.&nbsp; Of the
computation respecting Mull, I can give no account; but when I doubted
the truth of the numbers attributed to Sky, one of the Ministers exhibited
such facts as conquered my incredulity.</p>
<p>Of the proportion, which the product of any region bears to the people,
an estimate is commonly made according to the pecuniary price of the
necessaries of life; a principle of judgment which is never certain,
because it supposes what is far from truth, that the value of money
is always the same, and so measures an unknown quantity by an uncertain
standard.&nbsp; It is competent enough when the markets of the same
country, at different times, and those times not too distant, are to
be compared; but of very little use for the purpose of making one nation
acquainted with the state of another.&nbsp; Provisions, though plentiful,
are sold in places of great pecuniary opulence for nominal prices, to
which, however scarce, where gold and silver are yet scarcer, they can
never be raised.</p>
<p>In the Western Islands there is so little internal commerce, that
hardly any thing has a known or settled rate.&nbsp; The price of things
brought in, or carried out, is to be considered as that of a foreign
market; and even this there is some difficulty in discovering, because
their denominations of quantity are different from ours; and when there
is ignorance on both sides, no appeal can be made to a common measure.</p>
<p>This, however, is not the only impediment.&nbsp; The Scots, with
a vigilance of jealousy which never goes to sleep, always suspect that
an Englishman despises them for their poverty, and to convince him that
they are not less rich than their neighbours, are sure to tell him a
price higher than the true.&nbsp; When Lesley, two hundred years ago,
related so punctiliously, that a hundred hen eggs, new laid, were sold
in the Islands for a peny, he supposed that no inference could possibly
follow, but that eggs were in great abundance.&nbsp; Posterity has since
grown wiser; and having learned, that nominal and real value may differ,
they now tell no such stories, lest the foreigner should happen to collect,
not that eggs are many, but that pence are few.</p>
<p>Money and wealth have by the use of commercial language been so long
confounded, that they are commonly supposed to be the same; and this
prejudice has spread so widely in Scotland, that I know not whether
I found man or woman, whom I interrogated concerning payments of money,
that could surmount the illiberal desire of deceiving me, by representing
every thing as dearer than it is.</p>
<p>From Lochbuy we rode a very few miles to the side of Mull, which
faces Scotland, where, having taken leave of our kind protector, Sir
Allan, we embarked in a boat, in which the seat provided for our accommodation
was a heap of rough brushwood; and on the twenty-second of October reposed
at a tolerable inn on the main land.</p>
<p>On the next day we began our journey southwards.&nbsp; The weather
was tempestuous.&nbsp; For half the day the ground was rough, and our
horses were still small.&nbsp; Had they required much restraint, we
might have been reduced to difficulties; for I think we had amongst
us but one bridle.&nbsp; We fed the poor animals liberally, and they
performed their journey well.&nbsp; In the latter part of the day, we
came to a firm and smooth road, made by the soldiers, on which we travelled
with great security, busied with contemplating the scene about us.&nbsp;
The night came on while we had yet a great part of the way to go, though
not so dark, but that we could discern the cataracts which poured down
the hills, on one side, and fell into one general channel that ran with
great violence on the other.&nbsp; The wind was loud, the rain was heavy,
and the whistling of the blast, the fall of the shower, the rush of
the cataracts, and the roar of the torrent, made a nobler chorus of
the rough musick of nature than it had ever been my chance to hear before.&nbsp;
The streams, which ran cross the way from the hills to the main current,
were so frequent, that after a while I began to count them; and, in
ten miles, reckoned fifty-five, probably missing some, and having let
some pass before they forced themselves upon my notice.&nbsp; At last
we came to Inverary, where we found an inn, not only commodious, but
magnificent.</p>
<p>The difficulties of peregrination were now at an end.&nbsp; Mr. Boswell
had the honour of being known to the Duke of Argyle, by whom we were
very kindly entertained at his splendid seat, and supplied with conveniences
for surveying his spacious park and rising forests.</p>
<p>After two days stay at Inverary we proceeded Southward over Glencroe,
a black and dreary region, now made easily passable by a military road,
which rises from either end of the glen by an acclivity not dangerously
steep, but sufficiently laborious.&nbsp; In the middle, at the top of
the hill, is a seat with this inscription, &lsquo;Rest, and be thankful.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Stones were placed to mark the distances, which the inhabitants have
taken away, resolved, they said, &lsquo;to have no new miles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this rainy season the hills streamed with waterfalls, which, crossing
the way, formed currents on the other side, that ran in contrary directions
as they fell to the north or south of the summit.&nbsp; Being, by the
favour of the Duke, well mounted, I went up and down the hill with great
convenience.</p>
<p>From Glencroe we passed through a pleasant country to the banks of
Loch Lomond, and were received at the house of Sir James Colquhoun,
who is owner of almost all the thirty islands of the Loch, which we
went in a boat next morning to survey.&nbsp; The heaviness of the rain
shortened our voyage, but we landed on one island planted with yew,
and stocked with deer, and on another containing perhaps not more than
half an acre, remarkable for the ruins of an old castle, on which the
osprey builds her annual nest.&nbsp; Had Loch Lomond been in a happier
climate, it would have been the boast of wealth and vanity to own one
of the little spots which it incloses, and to have employed upon it
all the arts of embellishment.&nbsp; But as it is, the islets, which
court the gazer at a distance, disgust him at his approach, when he
finds, instead of soft lawns; and shady thickets, nothing more than
uncultivated ruggedness.</p>
<p>Where the Loch discharges itself into a river, called the Leven,
we passed a night with Mr. Smollet, a relation of Doctor Smollet, to
whose memory he has raised an obelisk on the bank near the house in
which he was born.&nbsp; The civility and respect which we found at
every place, it is ungrateful to omit, and tedious to repeat.&nbsp;
Here we were met by a post-chaise, that conveyed us to Glasgow.</p>
<p>To describe a city so much frequented as Glasgow, is unnecessary.&nbsp;
The prosperity of its commerce appears by the greatness of many private
houses, and a general appearance of wealth.&nbsp; It is the only episcopal
city whose cathedral was left standing in the rage of Reformation.&nbsp;
It is now divided into many separate places of worship, which, taken
all together, compose a great pile, that had been some centuries in
building, but was never finished; for the change of religion intercepted
its progress, before the cross isle was added, which seems essential
to a Gothick cathedral.</p>
<p>The college has not had a sufficient share of the increasing magnificence
of the place.&nbsp; The session was begun; for it commences on the tenth
of October and continues to the tenth of June, but the students appeared
not numerous, being, I suppose, not yet returned from their several
homes.&nbsp; The division of the academical year into one session, and
one recess, seems to me better accommodated to the present state of
life, than that variegation of time by terms and vacations derived from
distant centuries, in which it was probably convenient, and still continued
in the English universities.&nbsp; So many solid months as the Scotch
scheme of education joins together, allow and encourage a plan for each
part of the year; but with us, he that has settled himself to study
in the college is soon tempted into the country, and he that has adjusted
his life in the country, is summoned back to his college.</p>
<p>Yet when I have allowed to the universities of Scotland a more rational
distribution of time, I have given them, so far as my inquiries have
informed me, all that they can claim.&nbsp; The students, for the most
part, go thither boys, and depart before they are men; they carry with
them little fundamental knowledge, and therefore the superstructure
cannot be lofty.&nbsp; The grammar schools are not generally well supplied;
for the character of a school-master being there less honourable than
in England, is seldom accepted by men who are capable to adorn it, and
where the school has been deficient, the college can effect little.</p>
<p>Men bred in the universities of Scotland cannot be expected to be
often decorated with the splendours of ornamental erudition, but they
obtain a mediocrity of knowledge, between learning and ignorance, not
inadequate to the purposes of common life, which is, I believe, very
widely diffused among them, and which countenanced in general by a national
combination so invidious, that their friends cannot defend it, and actuated
in particulars by a spirit of enterprise, so vigorous, that their enemies
are constrained to praise it, enables them to find, or to make their
way to employment, riches, and distinction.</p>
<p>From Glasgow we directed our course to Auchinleck, an estate devolved,
through a long series of ancestors, to Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s father, the
present possessor.&nbsp; In our way we found several places remarkable
enough in themselves, but already described by those who viewed them
at more leisure, or with much more skill; and stopped two days at Mr.
Campbell&rsquo;s, a gentleman married to Mr. Boswell&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>Auchinleck, which signifies a stony field, seems not now to have
any particular claim to its denomination.&nbsp; It is a district generally
level, and sufficiently fertile, but like all the Western side of Scotland,
incommoded by very frequent rain.&nbsp; It was, with the rest of the
country, generally naked, till the present possessor finding, by the
growth of some stately trees near his old castle, that the ground was
favourable enough to timber, adorned it very diligently with annual
plantations.</p>
<p>Lord Auchinleck, who is one of the Judges of Scotland, and therefore
not wholly at leisure for domestick business or pleasure, has yet found
time to make improvements in his patrimony.&nbsp; He has built a house
of hewn stone, very stately, and durable, and has advanced the value
of his lands with great tenderness to his tenants.</p>
<p>I was, however, less delighted with the elegance of the modern mansion,
than with the sullen dignity of the old castle.&nbsp; I clambered with
Mr. Boswell among the ruins, which afford striking images of ancient
life.&nbsp; It is, like other castles, built upon a point of rock, and
was, I believe, anciently surrounded with a moat.&nbsp; There is another
rock near it, to which the drawbridge, when it was let down, is said
to have reached.&nbsp; Here, in the ages of tumult and rapine, the Laird
was surprised and killed by the neighbouring Chief, who perhaps might
have extinguished the family, had he not in a few days been seized and
hanged, together with his sons, by Douglas, who came with his forces
to the relief of Auchinleck.</p>
<p>At no great distance from the house runs a pleasing brook, by a red
rock, out of which has been hewn a very agreeable and commodious summer-house,
at less expence, as Lord Auchinleck told me, than would have been required
to build a room of the same dimensions.&nbsp; The rock seems to have
no more dampness than any other wall.&nbsp; Such opportunities of variety
it is judicious not to neglect.</p>
<p>We now returned to Edinburgh, where I passed some days with men of
learning, whose names want no advancement from my commemoration, or
with women of elegance, which perhaps disclaims a pedant&rsquo;s praise.</p>
<p>The conversation of the Scots grows every day less unpleasing to
the English; their peculiarities wear fast away; their dialect is likely
to become in half a century provincial and rustick, even to themselves.&nbsp;
The great, the learned, the ambitious, and the vain, all cultivate the
English phrase, and the English pronunciation, and in splendid companies
Scotch is not much heard, except now and then from an old Lady.</p>
<p>There is one subject of philosophical curiosity to be found in Edinburgh,
which no other city has to shew; a college of the deaf and dumb, who
are taught to speak, to read, to write, and to practice arithmetick,
by a gentleman, whose name is Braidwood.&nbsp; The number which attends
him is, I think, about twelve, which he brings together into a little
school, and instructs according to their several degrees of proficiency.</p>
<p>I do not mean to mention the instruction of the deaf as new.&nbsp;
Having been first practised upon the son of a constable of Spain, it
was afterwards cultivated with much emulation in England, by Wallis
and Holder, and was lately professed by Mr. Baker, who once flattered
me with hopes of seeing his method published.&nbsp; How far any former
teachers have succeeded, it is not easy to know; the improvement of
Mr. Braidwood&rsquo;s pupils is wonderful.&nbsp; They not only speak,
write, and understand what is written, but if he that speaks looks towards
them, and modifies his organs by distinct and full utterance, they know
so well what is spoken, that it is an expression scarcely figurative
to say, they hear with the eye.&nbsp; That any have attained to the
power mentioned by Burnet, of feeling sounds, by laying a hand on the
speaker&rsquo;s mouth, I know not; but I have seen so much, that I can
believe more; a single word, or a short sentence, I think, may possibly
be so distinguished.</p>
<p>It will readily be supposed by those that consider this subject,
that Mr. Braidwood&rsquo;s scholars spell accurately.&nbsp; Orthography
is vitiated among such as learn first to speak, and then to write, by
imperfect notions of the relation between letters and vocal utterance;
but to those students every character is of equal importance; for letters
are to them not symbols of names, but of things; when they write they
do not represent a sound, but delineate a form.</p>
<p>This school I visited, and found some of the scholars waiting for
their master, whom they are said to receive at his entrance with smiling
countenances and sparkling eyes, delighted with the hope of new ideas.&nbsp;
One of the young Ladies had her slate before her, on which I wrote a
question consisting of three figures, to be multiplied by two figures.&nbsp;
She looked upon it, and quivering her fingers in a manner which I thought
very pretty, but of which I know not whether it was art or play, multiplied
the sum regularly in two lines, observing the decimal place; but did
not add the two lines together, probably disdaining so easy an operation.&nbsp;
I pointed at the place where the sum total should stand, and she noted
it with such expedition as seemed to shew that she had it only to write.</p>
<p>It was pleasing to see one of the most desperate of human calamities
capable of so much help; whatever enlarges hope, will exalt courage;
after having seen the deaf taught arithmetick, who would be afraid to
cultivate the Hebrides?</p>
<p>Such are the things which this journey has given me an opportunity
of seeing, and such are the reflections which that sight has raised.&nbsp;
Having passed my time almost wholly in cities, I may have been surprised
by modes of life and appearances of nature, that are familiar to men
of wider survey and more varied conversation.&nbsp; Novelty and ignorance
must always be reciprocal, and I cannot but be conscious that my thoughts
on national manners, are the thoughts of one who has seen but little.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
