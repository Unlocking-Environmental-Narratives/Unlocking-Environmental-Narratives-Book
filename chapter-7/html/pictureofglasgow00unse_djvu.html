HISTORY 


OF 

GLASGOW. 


Topography presents many attractions as a 
subject of research. It is useful as combining ob¬ 
servations descriptive of the progress of society, and 
is estimable as delineating pictures of the changes 
produced upon the face of Nature by decline or by 
art. The beautiful and stupendous exhibitions of 
Supreme Wisdom and Power displayed in the dis¬ 
position of the Universe, and the imitative efforts of 
Man, in his endeavours after fame and happiness, 
are alike embraced in its investigations. Mankind, 
therefore, may contemplate themselves in its repre¬ 
sentations as the fairest and noblest of sublunary 
beings; and, while it makes the inhabitants of one 
country acquainted with the resources of another, 
it is to be regarded as a theme of utility, improve¬ 
ment, and delight. 


A 




2 Moral and social state of the ancient Britons. 

Britain has ever been a subject of peculiar regard 
to those who are observant of manners and of men. 
Amid its manifold attractions of wealth, grandeur, 
and picturesque beauty, no part of it has been more 
celebrated than the mountainous land of the North. 
That romantic region has been thrown, as it were, 
from the Creator’s hand into a scene of wild magni¬ 
ficence ; and its secluded inhabitants have remained, 
during the lapse of ages and amid the revolutions of 
states, a bold insuperable race, unyielding of their 
rights as the firm masses of their moveless hills. 
Whatever respects the people or the country has 
therefore been, at all times, a subject of laudable 
inquiry and desire. 

The primeval Briton, from what clime or what¬ 
ever race his fathers sprung, was a magnanimous 
being, by whom few wants were felt, and to whom 
enterprize and danger were familiar. The chase of 
his native woods furnished his family with subsis¬ 
tence, and the grot or the grove served them for a 
nightly dwelling. When associations became ne¬ 
cessary, their establishments were formed on some 
level field amid their forests, overshaded with trees, 
and washed by the waters of some pellucid stream. 
When the turbulent passions of the human heart had 
produced discord and odious war among the tribes, 
their desire of safety directed them to fix their 
strongholds upon the summits of inaccessible hills. 
Within these they lodged their wives and their chil¬ 
dren, and secured the spoils of their successful de¬ 
predations. Such of them as dwelt on the banks of 


Formation and extent of the Strath-Clydan kingdom. 5 

navigable rivers, or on the shores of the ocean, were 
accustomed to commit themselves with dreadless 
intrepidity to the inconstant element, and to make 
excursions of various length in their rude canoes, 
formed of the trunks of trees excavated by fire, or 
by unwieldy adzes of stone, and in coracles or cur- 
raghs constructed in the shape of boats, whose slen¬ 
der frames were covered with the hides of animals. 
Their intercourse with foreign nations, induced by 
whatever means, enlarged their knowledge and im¬ 
proved its application. By their Roman conquerors 
the Southern Britons were taught many of the arts 
by which man ameliorates his condition; but they 
were also, at the same time, made acquainted with 
the luxuries and unreal wants which embitter exis¬ 
tence and cherish insatiable desire. By such enjoy¬ 
ments, the boon of slavery, their natural vigour 
became enervated, while indolence and inaction un¬ 
braced their arms. But their brethren of the North, 
having manfully repulsed the intruders, scorned 
alike the inducements of usefulness and of ease. 
If they wished for the wealth of the strangers, it 
was only that they might exhibit its appendages as 
trophies of renown; and, for this, they contemned 
the dangers of the field, and procured those objects 
of ambition as the reward of their hardihood and 
self-denial. 

When the Romans under ^tius, in a. d. 446, de¬ 
parted from Britain, the native inhabitants of the 
province of Valentia formed themselves into a com¬ 
munity known, during the middle ages, under the

name of the Kingdom of Strath-Clyde, so denomi¬ 
nated from the noble stream which still gives beauty 
and fruitfulness to the land of its course. Of this 
district, bounded on the south by the Solway, on 
the north by Loch-Lomond, on the east by Lothian, 
and on the west by the Irish sea, the capital was 
Ald-Cluyd, now Dunbarton, on the northern bank 
of the Clyde. This ample territory, however, was 
daily diminished by the encroachments of strangers; 
the Anglo-Saxons from the south and east, the Piets 
and Scots from the north, and the Cruithne or Hi¬ 
bernian Britons from the west. At length, in a. d. 
975, Dunwallon the last of its princes, on the bloody 
field of Vacornar, resigned his crown and the inde¬ 
pendence of his country to Kenneth III. the enter- 
prizing king of the Scots. From that period, Strath- 
Clyde shared the fortunes, and contributed to the 
glory and opulence of the Scottish Kingdom, and 
its intelligent people consigned to their progeny 
their fertile territory, their energies, and their fame. 

The inhabitants of Strath-Clyde, as they were 
subjected during a shorter period to the Roman 
power, had their native vigour less dissipated than 
those of the other provinces, and were left more 
capable of turning to advantage the arts of their 
conquerors. They would, therefore, continue their 
application, which genius would improve as industry 
required. Instead of their wooden huts, they would 
construct more capacious and permanent dwellings, 
the union of which would be the origin of their little 
towns. Becoming better acquainted with the use-

ful qualities of grain and the modes of cultivating 
it, their infant agriculture would be prosecuted to 
the melioration of their excellent soil. At the same 
time, while their wants directed them to the stores 
of their prolific stream, the improvement of their 
fisheries would habituate them to danger, increase 
their experience, and prompt them to more distant 
and perilous adventures. Thus would they visit 
other shores and obtain the arts of other lands; 
and, in the sixth century, when Glasgow was be¬ 
ginning to rise into notice, the face of their country 
would be greatly changed, their modes of life im¬ 
proved, and civilization have begun its rapid career. 

Being undistinguished as a British fort or a Ro¬ 
man station, the origin of Glasgow is unknown. 
The remarkable spot which it occupies was included 
in the territory of the Damnii, the most energetic 
and numerous of the five tribes * whose country 
constituted the kingdom of the Strath-Clyde Bri¬ 
tons. This great city, important from its nume¬ 
rous population, and eminent for the excellence 
of its manufactures and its extensive commerce, 
stands in latitude 55° 52' 10 " N., and longitude 
4° 15' 51" W., on the northern bank of the river 
Clyde, in the county of Lanark. Its name points

his successful general, commemorated the name and the glories of the Em¬

formed, in A. D. 368-9, by the country of these tribes. See the Histories of 
Ancient Britain.

and such seems to have been the site of ancient 
Glasgow, in the vicinity of its cathedral, and on the 
woody banks of the Molendinar-bourn. * 

As the Druids, who were the priests of the Celtic 
race in Britain, as well as in other parts of the world, 
consecrated temples to the Supreme Being in groves 
and sequestered retreats, and were succeeded in these 
by the Christian Culdees, it is not improbable that, 
by the concourse around such a seclusion, was formed 
the hamlet of the green valley , from which the rich 
and many-peopled city of Glasgow arose. The first 
historical notice of the place, indeed, is of a religious 
establishment having been founded there, towards 
the end of the sixth century, by Kentigern, a disci- 


* To their places of temporary or permanent retreat, their mountains, 
their streams, and their groves, the primeval nations were accustomed to 
give appellations descriptive of their properties, appearances, and situation, 
or commemorative of achievements which, with various influence, had im¬ 
pressed their minds. The people of later ages did not altogether discon¬ 
tinue the practice. Examples of this practice may be deduced from the 
name of Glasgow and that of the Molendinar-bourn, whose banks must have 
been laved by the flow of purer waters during the lapse of former times.— 
Glasgow may be derived from the Celtic terms Glas , meaning blue, azure, 
green, verdant; and Go or Grv, a hollow, a dell, glen, or vale. In techni¬ 
cal Latin, Mola Molendinaria signifies a grist-mill. When Romanism was 
the established religion of the land, the cathedral of Glasgow was furnished 
with all the conveniences of life then known, for the use of its monks and 
their dependants. A mill would be required for preparing their grain ; and 
mills are still retained on the contiguous stream. What therefore would be 
denominated by them, Ri-vulus MoIjl Molendinc.r'ue , would afterwards be 
called the Grist-mill-bourn, the Mill-bourn, the Molendinar-bourn.—Ac¬ 
cording to Jocelyn in his Life of St. Kentigern, the old name of Glasgow 
was Cathures, from Cad or Cath, ’warfare , battle , having reference to some 
scene of blood. 







Genealogy and character of St. Kentigern. 7 

pie of Servan, the venerable Culdee of the Insh of 
Loch-Leven. 

Kentigern was the son of Owain ab Urien, and, 
as implied by his name Ceann, pronounced Ken, a 
head or chief, Tighearna, a person of high rank, a, 
lord, seems to have been chief ecclesiastic among 
the Northern Britons. Being of an affable, benevo¬ 
lent, and virtuous disposition, he was distinguished 
among his brethren by the endearing epithet Mungo, 
Urbanus, the Courteous One. Having fixed his re¬ 
sidence at Penrhyn-Rheonydd (either Glasgow or 
Dunbarton), he began to soften the manners and to 
instruct the minds of a restless people, by his lessons 
of piety and peace. But his useful labours were 
soon interrupted by the angry interference of Mar- 
ken, then king of Strath-Clyde, by whom he was 
obliged to remove into Wales. In that interesting 
country he remained some time, and founded a re¬ 
ligious house at St. Asaph, which still continues to 
be the respectable seat of a bishop. Rhydderch the 
Generous having succeeded to the honours and 
power of Marken, Kentigern was recalled and che¬ 
rished in his usefulness by the king. But he died 
on the 13th of January, a. d. 601 , after performing, 
for the improvement of his native land, all that 
zeal could suggest or perseverance execute. The 
very great number of chapels and churches dedi¬ 
cated to his memory, attests the merit of his labours, 
and the veneration in which his character was held 
by his successors. He was buried at the east end 
of the cathedral of Glasgow, where a monument.

pointed out to the curiosity of Strangers. * 

Glasgow continued during many subsequent ages 
to be only an establishment of the Culdees, who per¬ 
formed their public functions in a simple cyric, 
constructed chiefly of wood, and liable to frequent 
disrepair. Soon after his accession to the Scottish 
throne, however, it was formed into a bishoprick by 
David I., who appointed John Acliaius his chancel¬ 
lor, to preside over the recent see. This prelate was 
active in rebuilding with stone and ornamenting the 
cathedral, which he dedicated to Saint Mungo in 
a. d. 1 137* At this solemnity the king was present, 
and gave, by endowment, the lands of Partick on 
the Kelvin to the bishoprick. After having divided 
his diocese into the two archdeaconries of Glasgow 
and Teviotdale, established the offices of dean, sub¬ 
dean, chancellor, treasurer, sacrist, chanter, and suc¬ 
cessor, and settled a prebendary in each of them, 
out of the donations he received from his sovereign. 
John died on the 28th of May, 1146, and was bu¬ 
ried at Jedburgh, during the reign of Malcolm IV. 

Jocelyn, abbot of Melrose, being appointed to the 
vacant see in 1174, proceeded to enlarge the cathe¬ 
dral, and in 1180 found interest enough to procure

Its first markets, fair, and Magistrates. 9 

a charter from William the Lion, whereby the vil¬ 
lage of Glasgow was erected into a royal burgh, 
with the privilege of holding a-weekly market on 
the Thursdays. This bishop speaks of his Garden 
within the city; a circumstance which demonstrates 
that horticulture had become an object of attention 
in Scotland, during these early times. 

By the same means, also, a charter was obtained 
in 1190 , authorising a fair to be held every year in 
the city, for the space of eight days , with free access 
to the markets. It was not, however, till 1242, 
“ that the burgesses and men of the bishop were en¬ 
abled to trade in Lennox, Argyle, and Scotland, as 
freely as the men of Dunbarton.” The city appears 
to have been governed, in 1268, by its own magis¬ 
trates. A provost and baillies had been appointed, 
forming a completely organized Incorporation, to¬ 
gether with persons in official situations, whose duty 
it was to transfer property. Courts of Justice were 
also instituted for determining disputes among the 
inhabitants. In 1270, William, bishop of Glasgow, 
established the order of Dominican Friars within 
the city. 

Among the many vigorous enterprizes achieved 
by the Scots during the succession-war, the battle 
of Glasgow has been recorded by their historians 
and bards, with all the fervour of national feeling*. 
Having dispersed the bands of invading soldiers 
stationed in Ayr and its vicinity, the patriot Wal¬ 
lace, being joined by his uncle and Boswell of 
Auchinleck, with three hundred cavalry, hastened

to attack the English garrison, of one thousand 
men, in the Castle of Glasgow, and to expel An¬ 
thony Beik, a priestly sycophant, whom Edward I. 
had appointed bishop of the see. Information being 
given him of the number and situation of the hostile 
troops, the Scottish hero forded the river opposite 
the present Town-Hospital, rushed to the assault, 
and in a spirited action defeated the enemy, and 
slew Percy their general, with several hundreds of 
his soldiers. 

In 1345, the wooden bridge over the Clyde being 
found insufficient, one of stone was constructed in 
its place, at the expense of bishop Rae. The years 
1350, 1380, and 1381 are remarkable in the history 
of Glasgow, from the great number of its inhabitants 
which then fell victims to the baleful influence of 
the plague. While Matthew Glendonyng was bi¬ 
shop, the great spire of the cathedral, hitherto built 
solely of wood, was destroyed in 1387 by lightning. 
William Lauder, his successor, erected with stone, 
in 1408, the great tower as far as the first battle¬ 
ment. The vestry was also formed by the same 
prelate. Bishop Cameron founded, in 1430, and 
afterwards completed, the great tower of the epis¬ 
copal palace. In 1435, he directed his prebends to 
erect houses for themselves in the vicinity of the 
cathedral, and always to reside in the city: by which 
arrangement its increasing population would be far¬ 
ther augmented.

with the motto Robertas Dei Gratia Rex Scotorum , 
appears on one side of the money coined there; and, 
on an inner circle, are the words Villa de Glasgow , 
while Doniinus Protector is read on the outer. 

Previously to the middle of the fifteenth century, 
the city does not appear to have been occupied by 
more than fifteen hundred inhabitants. The Uni¬ 
versity was founded in 1450 by bishop Turnbull, 
who in the same year obtained a charter in his favour 
from James II., erecting the city and barony of Glas¬ 
gow, and lands called Bishop’s-Forest into a regality, 
with full power to constitute and appoint a provost, 
baillies, sergeants, and other municipal officers. Bi¬ 
shop Muirhead, who was consecrated in 1455, con¬ 
tributed to the extension of the city by founding 
Vicars in the Choir, and building houses for them 
on a spot north from the cathedral. From this cir¬ 
cumstance, the place was named Vicars’-Alley; but 
these ancient habitations have been erased many 
years ago, and their site converted into gardens. 

The bishoprick of Glasgow, in January 1488-9, 
was erected into a metropolitan see, and James IV., 
by a charter, afterwards confirmed the goods and 
privileges of its church. 

During the minority of Mary, Queen of Scots, the 
kingdom was agitated by factions. The Earl of 
Lennox, in 1542, was invited from France by a 
powerful party, headed by the Queen-dowager of 
James V. and Cardinal Beaton, in opposition to the 








12 Siege of the castle, and battle of the Butts. 

Earl of Arran, then Regent. Before his arrival, 
however, the latter nobleman had entered into an 
accommodation with his opposers, by which means 
the ambitious hopes of Lennox were disappointed. 
Nevertheless, by the distribution of some money, 
received from the French government, among his 
adherents, he soon excited them to hostilities, and, 
having fortified the Bishops’ Castle in Glasgow, 
proceeded thence to Dunbarton. Arran, however, 
being apprized of his designs, summoned an army 
to meet at Stirling, with ten days’ provision. With 
this he marched to Glasgow, and assailed the castle 
with brass guns. A truce of one day was then 
granted, during which, the soldiers being gained, 
the place was surrendered. Lennox, thus disap¬ 
pointed, and being now joined by the Earl of Glen- 
cairn, resolved, at the head of their tenants and ad¬ 
herents, to lay waste the lands of the Hamiltons on 
the banks of the Clyde. When putting this plan 
in execution, their party, headed by Glencairn, was 
met and attacked by the Regent at a spot called the 
Butts, where the Barracks now stand, and in a fu¬ 
rious action routed with much loss. Arran’s army, 
thus victorious, immediately entered Glasgow and 
plundered the town. After the engagement, Len¬ 
nox retired into England, where he afterwards mar¬ 
ried Lady Margaret Douglas, niece to Henry VIII.; 
from which union sprung Henry Stewart, Lord 
Darnly, husband to Mary, Queen of Scots, and fa¬ 
ther of James, the Jirst monarch of Great Britain. 








Original nomination of the Provost and Baillies. 13 

The Town-Council is recorded to have nominated 
the Lord Provost and Baillies., in 1559, for the first 
time. Next year the following municipal regula¬ 
tions were enacted by the Magistrates: That the 
fourpenny-loaf should weigh thirty-two ounces; 
That the price of the best ale sold in the city should 
not exceed four pennies Scots for the Scottish pint, 
which is one-third of a penny sterling for two quarts 
English; That a stone of tallow should not be sold 
for more than eight shillings Scots, a peck of horse’s 
corn than eight pennies, and one pound weight of 
candles than six pennies, or one halfpenny sterling. 

Glasgow was threatened, in 1563, with a famine, 
when the usual price of provisions was nearly trebled. 
A boll of oats at that time cost fifteen shillings Scots; 
a boll of meal, four merks; a boll of wheat, six 
pounds, or ten shillings sterling; an ox fit for the 
plough, twenty merks; and a wedder, thirty shil¬ 
lings, or two shillings and sixpence sterling.—The 
city was, at the same time, the scene of some distur¬ 
bances occasioned by the Queen’s marriage. These, 
however, were soon quelled by the approach of a 
royal army, and order re-established. Towards the 
end of 1566, Mary honoured the city of Glasgow 
with a short visit, having gone thither for the pur¬ 
pose of attending King Henry, her husband, who 

then lay sick in the house of Mr. Erskine, chancel- 
► 

lor of the chapter of the cathedral, situated on the 
north side of the Dry gate-street, which he was in¬ 
duced to leave for Edinburgh, before liis recovery 
was complete.

14 Battle of Langside, and Queen Mary’s flight. 

The battle of Langside, a small hamlet two miles 
south from Glasgow, was fought in 1568, and crushed 
for ever the hopes of the unfortunate Queen.—Mary 
was indeed born to a throne, but she was the child 
of wo. A few days only had elapsed from her birth, 
when the death of James V. her father, placed the 
crown on her infant head. In her sixth year, she 
was sent by the Scottish Regency into France to be 
educated; the intrigues of England having rendered 
it necessary for her personal safety. The charms of 
her beauty and her mental acquirements made a 
deep impression on Francis, the young and amiable 
dauphin of France. She became his wife, and on 
his accession to the throne. Queen of France. Sick¬ 
ness soon terminated his reign, which promised much 
felicity to the royal pair. By the desire of her na¬ 
tive subjects, Mary now returned to Scotland; and, 
during two years, was actively engaged in compos¬ 
ing their feuds and ameliorating their manners. On 
the 29th of July, 1565, in her twenty-third year, 
she married her cousin, Henry Stewart, Lord Darn- 
ley, after herself, the nearest heir to the British 
crowns. The plots of their enemies rendered disas¬ 
trous their short-lived union. They murdered her 
weak, though worthless, husband; and, by their 
iniquitous intrigues, the Queen, after being deserted 
and dishonoured, was compelled to become the wife 
of the Earl of Bothwell, who had imbrued his hands 
in the blood of the youthful king. The prime movers 
of all these dark designs were the Earls of Morton, 
Bothwell, and Murray the Queen’s illegitimate bro-

ther, the most subtle and ambitious of all the con¬ 
spirators. Hitherto this man’s schemes were suc¬ 
cessful ; and, now, by his contrivance, an armed 
association, on pretence of avenging the King’s 
death, was formed against the Queen and Bothwell. 
The partisans on both sides were assembled, and 
met at Carberry-hill in hostile array. On observing 
the irresolution of her followers, Mary entered into 
terms with the confederated chiefs, and Bothwell 
escaped from the field to Orkney; where, turning 
pirate to procure means of subsistence, he was taken 
by the Danes, and consigned to a dungeon, where 
he perished in ignominy and want. The Queen 
was now in the hands of men destitute of faith or 
patriotism. They instantly broke their engage¬ 
ments, and sent her a prisoner to the lonely fortress 
of Loch-Leven. There, by the brutality of Lord 
Lindsay, she was compelled to sign a resignation * 
of the crown to her infant son, and at the same time 
to assent to the appointment of her infamous brother 
to be Regent of the kingdom. Her beauty and suf- 


* This cruel scene attracted the notice of Ramsay the painter, son of Allan 
Ramsay the celebrated Scottish poet, who made it the subject of a very inter¬ 
esting historical piece, “ Mary’s Resignation of her Crown in Loch-Leven 
Castle.” For Mr. Boswell’s copy of this picture, Dr. Johnson composed the 
following inscriptive sentiment:

Death of Mary: the Regent’s bounty to the city. 


ferings at last procured her the interest of George 
Douglas, the younger brother of her keeper. By 
his means she effected a perilous escape, and was 
received with joy by her loyal subjects. Her friends 
and their followers gathered fast around her, and 
she soon found herself at the head of an army equal 
to that of her foes. From Hamilton she marched 
towards Dunbarton, wishing to spare her people the 
calamities of war. Murray, the Regent, led his for¬ 
ces from Glasgow, and met those of Mary at Lang- 
side on the 13th of May, 1568, and was victorious. 
On a little hill in the neighbourhood and beneath 
the shade of an aged thorn, Mary stood during the 
action, the sad beholder of the ruin of her cause. 
From the field she fled in despair, with a few trusty 
attendants, to Dundrennan-abbev in Galloway, sixty 
miles distant from the fatal scene. After a short 
repose, she formed the unhappy resolution of pas¬ 
sing into England, where she was received with an 
insidious welcome. There, having endured innu¬ 
merable insults and sufferings during nineteen years’ 
imprisonment, she fell a victim in Fotheringay Cas¬ 
tle, on the 8th of February, 1587, to the guilty pas¬ 
sions of Elizabeth, the English Queen. 

Flushed with victory, Murray’s heart now admit¬ 
ted sentiments of gratitude towards the citizens of 
Glasgow, to whose friendship and bravery he owed 
much of his success. Returning from the field, he 
was regaled by the Magistrates, to whom he ex¬ 
pressed his sense of obligation, and to the Incorpo¬ 
ration of Bakers he gave the mill of Partick and 







Rank of the Trades’ and Merchants’ Houses arranged.

lands connected with it, in return for their having 
liberally supplied his army with bread when quar¬ 
tered in their neighbourhood. 

In 1569, the Magistrates made an enactment that 
wine should not be sold at a higher price than eigh¬ 
teen pennies Scots, or three halfpence sterling, the 
Scottish pint.—The Hamiltons and other partisans 
in Mary’s interest endeavoured, in the course of 
1570, to surprize the castle of Glasgow, but were 
repulsed and obliged to retire with loss.—Robert, 
Earl of Lennox, was entered a burgess of Glasgow 
on the 30th of September, 1578, and elected Lord 
Provost in the same year.—In 1592, its numerous 
altars were removed, and the Laigh Kirk thoroughly 
repaired. About this time also many of the Uni¬ 
versity buildings were erected.—In 1603, the old tol- 
booth at the cross, which stood 209 years, was built. 

Disputes respecting superiority in the manage¬ 
ment of public affairs arose, in 1604, between the 
merchants and other corporations of the city. The 
merchants had exercised the whole sway, monopo¬ 
lized the magistracy, and assumed the sole right of 
managing the funds. The trades, who were more 
numerous, insisted on a participation of office. The 
animosities which had arisen from this source, were 
at last allayed by a submission of the points of dif¬ 
ference to Sir George Elphinston of Blythswood, 
then Provost, the parson of Glasgow, and two mi¬ 
nisters of the city. The award of these arbitrators 
was published on the 6th of February, 1605, and is 
termed the Letter of Guildry. By it, the officers of

Glasgow made a Royal Free Borough. 


Dean of Guild and Deacon Convener were estab¬ 
lished ; the one, the head of the Merchants’, and the 
other of the Trades’ House. A number of similar 
regulations respecting the election of the Town- 
Council, and other subjects connected with the in¬ 
ternal government of the city were, at the same 
time, made. This Letter of Guildry was approved 
and ratified by the Magistrates and Council, on the 
pth of February, 1605, and was afterwards con¬ 
firmed by an Act of Parliament of Charles II., on 
the 11th September, 1672. 

About this time, and during several of the subse¬ 
quent years, the institutions and appendages of the 
ancient ecclesiastical establishment were suppressed, 
and applied to secular purposes. 

On the l6th of October, 1633, the City of Glas¬ 
gow was declared by Act of Parliament to be a 

Royal „f'tcc liotouflf). 

in 1636, a Water-Baillie was appointed by Royal 
Charter, with power to exercise a maritime, civil, 
and criminal jurisdiction, from the bridge of Glas¬ 
gow to the Clough, near the mouth of the Clyde, 
and twenty-six miles below the town. 

Graham, Marquis of Montrose, a chivalrous war¬ 
rior of the Moslem school, after having defeated the 
Presbyterians at Kilsyth, in 1645, entered Glasgow, 
and, with the pious object of promoting their con¬ 
version, levied a contribution from the heretical in¬ 
habitants. 







Finest part of the city destroyed by fire. 19 

The Magistrates, on account of their resistance to 
a levy of forces, then raising to invade England, for 
the purpose of rescuing Charles I. from the hands 
of the republicans, were ejected from their offices, 
in 1648, by an act of the revolutionary parliament. 

The city was wasted, in 1649, by the complicated 
calamities of a plague, a famine, and a civil war. 
These were soon followed by a fatal disaster of an¬ 
other kind. A fire broke out, on July 17th, 1652, 
in a narrow alley on the east side of the High-street, 
which, after raging several days with irresistible 
fury, laid in ruins the finest part of the city, and 
rendered nearly one thousand families houseless and 
unsheltered. The amount of the loss in property 
was not less than £ 100,000 sterling. Subscriptions 
were immediately opened for the relief of the unfor¬ 
tunate sufferers; and Oliver Cromwell, * who had 
been in the city and known the Magistrates, took 
an active share in procuring the means of alleviating 
the public distress. This accident, however afflic¬ 
tive, was so far of advantage that, in rebuilding with 
stone the houses which were heretofore constructed 
of wood, and without observation of a prescribed 


* When Cromwell visited the University here, Mr. Patrick Gillespie, mi¬ 
nister of the Outer High Church, whom Cromwell had appointed Principal, 
in the course of conversation informed him, that Charles I. subscribed £100 
towards ornamenting its principal front; Cromwell took the hint, and or¬ 
dered the money to be paid—Some time afterwards, when one of thebaillies 
of Perth was introduced to the Protector, he told him that Charles had sub¬ 
scribed a considerable sum for a public building in Perth, and rather bluntly 
asked him for the money; when Oliver instantly replied, “ I am not Charles’s 
executor.” The baillie, who was not to be intimidated, archly answered, 
“ Deil ma 1 care, ye’re a vitious intromitter wi’ his gudes and gear.”

plan, more attention was given to elegance and re¬ 
gularity. 

In 1652, the City purchased the lands, lordship, 
and barony of Provan, from Sir Robert Hamilton of 
Silverton-hall.—Oliver Cromwell, by an arbitrary 
interference with the political immunities of Glas¬ 
gow, directed the Lord Provost, by a letter received 
on the 30th of September, 1658, to defer the elec¬ 
tion of Magistrates. 

Charles II. being an ardent promoter of the Epis¬ 
copal form of church-government, while the Scots 
adhered with the firmest perseverance to the Pres¬ 
byterian, became the cause of much national cala¬ 
mity. The people of Glasgow accordingly suffered 
greatly on account of their attachment to their re¬ 
ligious principles, during 1656, 1666, and 1674. 
Many of them were hanged in the streets, and 
others, by the fear of suffering a similar fate, were 
deterred from attending the Calvinistic preachers. 

During a violent storm, in 1666 , the ancient Col¬ 
lege Church, built on the site of a ruined Gothic 
pile, was destroyed by lightning. 

Glasgow was a second time, in 1677, almost de¬ 
stroyed by a dreadful fire: one thousand families 
being thereby left without a habitation, and one 
hundred shops and houses consumed. As it threat¬ 
ened the prison, in which a great number of people 
was confined, chiefly for their religious opinions, 
the citizens broke open the doors and set them at 
liberty. 

The Covenanters, being at this time roused to re-

sentment by the repeated cruelties to which their 
oppressors daily subjected them, took arms, and, 
being animated with an enthusiastic zeal, fought 
and often conquered their inveterate enemies. Af¬ 
ter a successful skirmish, near Loudon-hill, with a 
party under Viscount Dundee, an intrepid but cruel 
and ungenerous officer, who had been sent by the 
king to disperse them, they marched to Glasgow. 
Advancing in two divisions by the road from Ha¬ 
milton, they entered the city by the Gallowgate 
and College-vennal. Soon after, they met and en¬ 
gaged the royalists with undaunted bravery. Being 
galled, however, from windows and the tops of 
houses, and unable to contend with the superior 
discipline of mercenary soldiers, they retired, but 
in regular retreat, from the town. 

The battle of Bothwell Bridge, which was fought 
on the 21st of June, 1 679, suppressed for a time the 
Presbyterian forces, and subjected Glasgow to the 
scourge of the apostles of intolerancy. Viscount 
Dundee requested permission to burn the city and o- 
ther towns of the West, on account of their resistance 
to the agents of despotism. The Government, lost 
as it w r as to every principle of equity and patriotism, 
refused to authorize a measure so barbarous and un¬ 
just. Glasgow, however, was necessitated to pur¬ 
chase an exemption from greater evils, by renounc¬ 
ing to Edinburgh a debt of thirty thousand merks, 
which was held on the Canon-mills, a dependancy 
of the Scottish capital. 



22 William and Mary grant a new charter to Glasgow. 

Upon the flight of James II. the Magistrates of 
Glasgow sent to Edinburgh, under the command of 
the Earl of Argyle and Lord Newbottle, 500 men 
well armed and disciplined. These soldiers were 
intended to assist in guarding the Convention of 
Estates, then met to deliberate on the settlement of 
the crown upon William and Mary. So devoted 
w r ere the inhabitants of Glasgow to the cause of 
Presbyterianism, and so enraged by the cruel per¬ 
secutions of the abettors of Episcopacy, that they 
succeeded in raising this regiment of 500 men in 
one day. The Convention constituted itself into a 
Parliament; and, having abolished that form of 
church-government, established in its stead the 
Presbyterian, for which the nation had so vigor¬ 
ously contended during the two preceding reigns. 
In consequence of this act, John Paterson, who then 
held the See of Glasgow, resigned his office and re¬ 
tired to Edinburgh, where, two years afterwards, he 
died at the age of seventy-six. 

From the year 1450, when the town and ecclesi¬ 
astical patrimony were incorporated, down to the 
Reformation, the bishops, or certain lay lords in their 
right, nominated the Magistrates. Soon after Wil¬ 
liam and Mary were, in 1690 , raised to the throne, 
they changed this mode of election, and granted in 
favour of the community of Glasgow, and in consi¬ 
deration of their loyalty, a new Charter, which was 
confirmed by an Act of Parliament in the same year. 
By this, they “ enact and ordain, that the City of 




William discourages the Scottish colony of Darien. 23

as fully and freely, in all respects, as the City of 
Edinburgh, or any other royal burgh within the 
kingdom.” By this charter, their right of election, 
which, since the last in 1633, had been questioned 
and infringed by Cromwell and his Privy Council, 
was established and confirmed, and this right they 
have ever since uninterruptedly enjoyed. 

In I 694 -, a dispute between a citizen and a soldier 
was submitted to the sitting Magistrate. Robert 
Park, the town-clerk, supported the cause of the 
citizen, and Major James Menzies that of the sol¬ 
dier. High words ensued, when in the heat of pas¬ 
sion, the Major stabbed Mr. Park, and immediately 
fled. He was pursued, and, in consequence of re¬ 
sistance, shot in Ren field garden. 

William, though he favoured the citizens by thus 
confirming their liberties, yet of himself or by his 
ministers, greatly injured them and many others, in 
1695, by discouraging the infant colony of Darien. 
Glasgow was deeply engaged in this scheme, of the 
success of which the most reasonable hopes were for 
a considerable time entertained. The envy and ma¬ 
chination, however, of some English merchants at 
last accomplished its destruction, thereby annihilat¬ 
ing a source of national prosperity, and inducing 
much individual misfortune.

year, for a monthly cess on the royal boroughs, we

The citizens of Glasgow, being sensible of the in- 
conveniency to their trade arising from the want of a 
sufficient depth of water at the Broomielaw, resolved 
to have a port farther down the river, and capable 
of admitting vessels of any burthen. They accord¬ 
ingly proposed forming a harbour at Dunbarton. 
But the magistrates of that borough opposed the 
measure, on the ground that the influx of sailors 
and great increase of inhabitants, would be the 
cause of raising the price of provisions! The magis¬ 
trates and town-council of Glasgow, therefore, feued 
eleven acres of ground on the south bank of the

river, in the vicinity of the old village of Newark, 
and, in 1695, procured it to be erected into a separate 
parish. There they immediately laid the foundation 
of the now respectable town of New-Port-Glasgow, 
about nineteen miles distant from the city. 

During the civil commotions which agitated Scot¬ 
land in 1715, the people of Glasgow distinguished 
themselves by very vigorous exertions in defence of 
the succession of the protestant House of Hanover. 
For this purpose, besides arming 600 men, whom 
they sent to Stirling under the Duke of Argyle, they 
provided for the security of the city, by drawing 
round it a ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep. 

In the year 1720, the Lord Provost of Glasgow 
began first to give external splendour to his office 
by assuming a velvet court-dress ; and the Provost, 
Baillies, Dean of Guild, and Convener, in 1767 , by 
wearing gold chains. The Baillie of the River on 
May 8th, 1810, and the Baillies of Gorbals on June 
9th, 1812, adopted the same official badge. 

The extension of the malt-tax to Scotland excited 
the reprobation of every party and of every person 
in this kingdom. At Glasgow, a city noted for its 
loyalty, an assemblage of insurgents, on the 24th of 
June, 1725, sacked the house of Daniel Campbell, 
Esq. of Shawheld, its representative in parliament, 
and expelled the king’s troops. These were com¬ 
manded by Captain Bushel, who, although by their 
fire twenty of the rioters had fallen, were obliged to 
retire towards Dunbarton. Every town and village

were ready to imitate this example; and the king’s 
servants at length saw, with reluctant eyes, that the 
united wishes of a whole people must be respected. 
They established the office of Secretary of State for 
Scotland, and sent to that country, as a confidential 
agent, the Earl of Ilay, a nobleman of uncommon ad¬ 
dress and talents, yet little scrupulous in his means. 
General Wade, with Duncan Forbes of Culloden, 
marched at the head of an army into Glasgow, where 
there were none to oppose them. They took posses¬ 
sion of the town, apprehended the magistrates and 
carried them into Edinburgh, where after the Com¬ 
missioners of Justiciary had taken cognisance of the 
affair, they were honourably acquitted. The rioters 
were tried before the Court of Justiciary, wherein 
the Earl of Ilay, as Lord-Justice-General, presided. 
Sir Walter Pringle, Lord Newhall, a gentleman of 
worth and a lawyer of eminence, led the Court a- 
gainst the Justice-General in support of a mild con¬ 
struction of the law, and of a mitigated punishment. 
Some of the most guilty persons were whipped in 
Glasgow; others were transported to the plantations. 
Mr. Campbell was afterwards re-imbursed for his 
losses, by receiving £6,400 sterling out of the city’s 
funds. By this impolitic measure, on the part of a 
family so largely indebted to the city for its estab¬ 
lishment on the throne, the inhabitants were exas¬ 
perated, and roused to these acts of violence, an ex¬ 
pense amounting to not less than £9000 was incurred. 

Glasgow suffered considerably during the unsuc¬ 
cessful attempt, in 1745, to restore the exiled family

of Stewart to the throne. When Charles-Edward 
the Pretender had seized Edinburgh, he sent a party 
of horse under John Hay, a writer to the signet, with 
a requisition to the magistrates of Glasgow, to trans¬ 
mit to him the arrears of their taxes to government, 
all the arms in their possession, and £ 15,000, with 
a threat of military execution unless these exactions 
were complied with. They pleaded incapacity to 
raise the money, and at last Mr. Hay consented to 
accept of £5000 in cash, and £500 in goods. On 
the return of the Highlanders from England, they 
visited the town in full force, and demanded 0000 
cloth-coats, 6000 pairs of shoes, 6000 pairs of hose. 
6000 bonnets, and 12,000 linen shirts. With these 
demands the magistrates were under the necessity of 
complying, and thereby actually clothed, from head 
to foot, the whole Highland army. The citizens in 
the mean while, undoubtedly merited these exac¬ 
tions at the Prince’s hands. They had raised for the 
service of the existing government, two battalions of 
600 men each, which acted in the battle of Falkirk* 
under the Earl of Home. These troops, according 
to an historian whose candour is undoubted, and his 
means of information correct, were not affected with 


* A serio-comic description of this battle is given in a letter addressed to 
the Lord President Forbes, by Mr. William Corse, at that time a candidate 
for a Professorship in the University of Glasgow. It is published in the 
Culloden-Papers, No. CCCXIII. The writer was attached to the Glasgow 
Regiment and present in the action, the circumstances of which he repre¬ 
sents with the picturesque freedom of an eye-witness, who perceived, but did 
not choose to express the egregious blunders of the person entrusted, on that 
day, with the command of the royal army.

the panic that seized the king’s troops,, and perform¬ 
ed the service allotted to them with great gallantry. 
Charles resided in Glasgow, from the 9,5th Decem¬ 
ber, 1745, to the 3d January, 1746. But he was 
received with the most sullen and uninviting silence. 
When he went abroad the streets w r ere left solitary. 
This contemptuous neglect exasperated the Highland 
chiefs to such a degree, that they threatened to plun¬ 
der and burn the town. A proposal so barbarous was 
vigorously and successfully resisted by the spirited 
generosity of Cameron of Lochiel, who threatened to 
withdraw his clan if the odious enterprise were at¬ 
tempted. 

The expense incurred by the City of Glasgow, in 
the payment of these contributions and raising the 
two battalions, amounted to upwards of £l 5,000 ster¬ 
ling. An application being afterwards made to Par¬ 
liament for compensation, the sum of £ 10,000 was 
voted to the city. With this, added to the success of 
the cause in which they were engaged, the citizens 
were satisfied! 

Glasgow was now rising into distinction among 
commercial cities, and her connexions widely ex¬ 
tending. Her energies were, therefore, directed to 
promote the enterprise of her citizens, and to facili¬ 
tate their intercourse with foreign states. With this 
intention a canal to unite the rivers Forth and Clyde 
was projected. The original plan, which was to make 
a cut only four feet deep, after much discussion and 
opposition, was abandoned, when the projectors, be¬ 
ing joined by some wealthy citizens of Edinburgh, 




Canal Company incorporated, and the work begun. 


29 


and many of the nobility and gentry of the country, 
by the sanction of parliament, were incorporated 
under the name of “ The Company of Proprietors of 
the Forth and Clyde Navigation.” The estimate of 
the expense amounted to £150,000; and the joint 
stock of the company was declared to consist of 1500 
shares of £ 100 each,* with liberty to borrow £50,000. 
The holders of five shares are entitled to vote by 
themselves or proxies, and to be elected managers of 
the company. On the 10th of July, 1768, the work 
was begun under the direction of Mr. John Smeaton, 
an able engineer. The operations commenced at the 
east end; and the late Sir Lawrence Dundas of Kerse 
performed the ceremony of cutting and removing the 
first spadeful of earth. The spade he used is said to 
be kept in Kerse-house, as a memorial of the transac¬ 
tion. Many difficulties occurred in the execution of 
the work, which had not been foreseen; but at length, 
on the 10th of November, 1775, the canal was fit 
for navigation as far west as Stockingfield, within a 
few miles of Glasgow, and the place where the side- 
branch to that city goes off. In November, 1777, 
the side-branch was completed to Hamilton-hill; and 
a basin was made there for the reception of vessels, 
and granaries and other buildings erected by the 
neighbouring proprietors. At this time the expense 
far exceeded the original estimate, and the canal 
remained in a languishing and unfinished state till

30 Completion of the Canal, and formation of Port-Dundas. 

1784, when government granted &lt;£50,000, out of 
the rents of the forfeited estates in Scotland, towards 
completing it. In July, 1786, the committee of man¬ 
agement renewed their operations, under the conduct 
of Mr. Robert Whitworth; and on the 28th of July, 
1790, a navigable course was opened from sea to sea, 
accompanied with a ceremony of pompous solemnity. 
The committee of management and the magistrates 
of Glasgow were the first voyagers on the completed 
canal. On the arrival of their vessel at Bowling-Bay, 
and after descending the last lock into the Clyde, the 
ceremony of uniting the Eastern and Western seas 
was performed by the chairman of the committee, with 
the assistance of Mr. Whitworth the engineer, by the 
symbol of pouring into the Cly de a hogshead of water 
taken out of the Forth. A vast concourse of specta¬ 
tors attended, and expressed, by loud acclamations, 
their joy on account of the completion of the work. 

The basin at Hamilton-hill being found inadequate 
to the reception of the great number of vessels which 
now navigated the canal, as well as inconvenient for 
the trade of Glasgow, eight acres of ground were 
purchased by the Canal-Company, and a basin con¬ 
structed on a large scale, with appropriate buildings, 
so as to form a village named Port-Dundas, in com¬ 
pliment to Sir Lawrence Dundas, the Governor of 
the Company of Proprietors. From this, the Com¬ 
pany carried a branch to the Monkland-Canal, at a 
small basin near the town-head, with the design of 
obtaining a large supply of water, of which the latter 
enjoys a superfluity.

distant from Glasgow, which was begun in June 
1787, and finished in April, 1791, at the expense of 
£8,509. It consists of four great arches of mason- 
work. Its height is 83 feet, and it crosses a dell of

The Great Canal is supplied with water from six 
reservoirs, which cover 409 acres of land, and contain 
nearly 16,000 lockfuls; and, should the increase of 
trade require it, the means exist whereby more than

double that quantity can be supplied. The canal- 
duties are various on the different commodities. For 
grain and goods in general, as enumerated in the 
Company’s Table of Tolls for 1814, is paid 3d. per 
ton per mile; for wood of all kinds, 2^d.; pig-iron 
and other coarse articles, 2d.; for lime 1 Jd.; for coal, 
lime-stone, slates, building-stone, iron-ore, flags, po¬ 
tatoes, dung, and all kinds of manure, 1 d.; and ^d. 
for sand, soil, moss, and gravel. The whole expense 
of the canal, 1799&gt; had amounted to £421,525; which 
was then fixed by Act of Parliament, as the stock of 
the Company. The principal part of the revenue 
arises from grain and timber, the last of which comes 
from the shores of the Baltic. 

A considerable sum is also produced by the con¬ 
veyance of passengers in track-boats, elegantly and 
commodiously fitted up for that purpose; and subject 
to a set of lides, judiciously arranged for their ease 
and accommodation. These proceed from Glasgow 
at the one end, and from No. id, near Falkirk, at 
the other, at 10 o’clock, a. m. every lawful day; the 
fare for the cabin 4s. and 2 s. for the steerage. An¬ 
other boat also returns from Glasgow at 4 o’clock, 
p. m. having started from Wyndford at 6 in the 
morning, for the purpose of bringing people to the 
Glasgow markets. The fare is 2d. per mile in the 
cabin, and Id. in the steerage, and the accommoda¬ 
tion is equally convenient and agreeable as in the 
others. The number of passengers conveyed in the 
track-boats during the last three years were, in 1814, 
seventy-five thousand two hundred and ten, who paid

£6l64 8 9; in 1815, eighty-five thousand three hun¬ 
dred and sixty-eight, who paid £6987 15 8; in 1816, 
eighty thousand eight hundred and eighty, who paid 
£6560 10 7. In the latter year, forty-three vessels 
were loaded at Port-Dundas for the Baltic, with su¬ 
gar, muslins, and cotton-yarn. 

The affairs of the Company are in a very prosper¬ 
ous condition. Having paid off an original debt of 
£70,000, at Martinmas, 1800, they made a dividend 
of £l0 per cent.; in 1801, £l0 10 4; in 1814, £15; 
in 1815, £20; in 1816, £25; and in 1817, £25. By 
an Act of Parliament, 1806, they were placed under 
the direction of a governor and council in London, 
and a committee of management in Glasgow. Both 
these are elected by a general meeting held annually 
in the month of March in London. 

The Monkland Canal was first suggested in 1769 , 
but not completed till 179L Its course, after a sur¬ 
vey by Mr. James Watt, an engineer then residing 
in the city, was extended nearly 12 miles, from the 
town-head of Glasgow to the coaleries at Faskine in 
the vicinity of Airdrie. The original capital of the 
projectors was declared, by Act of Parliament, to be 
£10,000, divided into one hundred equal shares. 
This sum, however, being inadequate to the expense 
of the undertaking, a debt to a large amount was in¬ 
curred. By this reason, the proprietors were induced 
to offer their whole stock to public sale, when it was 
purchased, at the rate of twenty-five pounds for each 
share, by Messrs. William Stirling and Sons of Glas¬ 
gow, who soon finished the work, and improved the

original plan.—This Canal is 35 feet broad at the 
surface of the water, 24 at the bottom, and nearly 5 
in depth. It is chiefly supplied by the river Calder, 
and a reservoir covering 300 acres near the source 
of that stream. Four locks at Blackhill, and two 
at Sheepford, each forming a rise of about 12 feet, 
complete its level. Coals form the principal article 
of conveyance; they are carried along it in boats 68 
feet long, 10 or 12 wide, and 4 deep, containing from 
24 to 36 tons each, and drawn by one horse. 

Boats for passengers were first employed in this 
Canal in 1813. One continues to go from Glasgow 
at 4 o’clock, p. m. every lawful day for Sheepford, 
where it arrives at half-past 6 in the evening: the 
fare is 1 s. 6d. in the cabin; for the steerage, 1 s. An¬ 
other boat leaves the Sheepford-locks at half-past 7 
o’clock in the morning, and reaches the town-head 
basin at 10 o’clock. In 1814, eleven thousand four 
hundred and seventy, and in 1815, twelve thousand 
seven hundred and seventy-three passengers went in 
these boats.—A dividend of the revenue of the Monk- 
land Canal was first made in 1807, when it amounted 
to £4725; in 1814, to ,£5087; in 181 6, to nearly 
£10,000. Between £1200 and £1500 are annually 
expended on the various necessary repairs. 

Before the commencement of hostilities with An 

* 

merica, the intercourse of Glasgow with that country 
was very great. During the melancholy struggle 
which ensued, the loyalty of her citizens to the go¬ 
vernment was nevertheless equally conspicuous as 
on former occasions. They assisted the king both

with ships and land-forces; and, in 1778, raised and 
equipped a regiment (afterwards the 83d) of 1000 
men, at an expense exceeding £ 10,000 sterling. 

In 1779, when a bill was proposed to be intro¬ 
duced to repeal the penal statutes against the Roman 
Catholics, a strong spirit of opposition was mani¬ 
fested in various parts of Scotland; some indecent 
and violent outrages were in consequence commit¬ 
ted, and this intemperate zeal communicated itself 
to some fanatics in Glasgow. A Romish Chapel in 
the High-street was attacked by the populace dur¬ 
ing the time of divine service, and the congregation 
violently dispersed. The fury of this misguided and 
ignorant rabble was afterwards directed to the shop 
and works of Mr. Bagnal, a potter, and member of 
the Romish Communion. His property was utterly 
destroyed, and his wife and family, after many in¬ 
dignities, compelled to seek refuge in the city, the 
neighbours being afraid to shelter them. The ma¬ 
gistrates and clergy, without delay, repaired the 
depredations of the mob, and refunded Mr. Bagnal’s 
whole loss. 

Glasgow, from its situation, is in many parts sub¬ 
ject to inundations of the river. The Clyde, as it 
flows through a long tract of country and is fed by 
many tributary rivulets, frequently overflows its 
banks. Beyond every previous period, the month 
of March, 1782, was remarkable for the excess of its 
increase, and the distress it produced in the lower 
parts of the town. The rain had continued to fall 
in torrents, and the cataracts that rush from the hills,

had poured down their streams. The river increased 
with rapid and resistless violence, till the Green was 
covered, the passage by the bridges stopped, and 
every place in the vicinity of its banks become one 
vast sheet of water. The Clyde now presented a 
picture grand, awful, and sublime, as it rolled along 
silent and majestic. On its surface large trees were 
borne onward with velocity, and horses, cattle, sheep, 
and grain, were swept away by the impetuosity of 
its course. Had it continued to increase, the stone 
bridges over the river must have been swept away, 
but it, happily, subsided before the accomplishment 
of such a scene of ruin. Being surrounded by wa¬ 
ter, those who lived in the vicinity of the river were 
exposed to imminent danger. It was night; and the 
night w T as dark and tempestuous. The water entered 
their houses, extinguished their fires, and roused the 
unconscious sleepers from their beds, presenting to 
the bewildered imagination the terrific prospect of a 
watery grave. In this situation, forlorn and dreary, 
they passed the dismal night. No assistance could 
be given them. To attempt an escape, was to rush 
upon destruction; to remain, exposed them every 
moment to the risk of being drowned. They saw 
nothing but an expanse of water, and heard nothing 
but the w r ailing of other sufferers, and the rushing of 
surrounding floods. But the day dawned at length 
on their anxious eyes, and assistance was r fortunate¬ 
ly, at hand. Boats were procured, which brought 
off many, and carried provisions to such as chose to 


remain.

58 The city threatened with a famine. 

The Clyde, after rising, at this time, twenty feet 
above its usual level, again gradually subsided. Not 
only the Bridgegate, but also great part of the Salt- 
market, Stockwell, and Jamaica-street were over¬ 
flown. The village of Gorbals appeared as an island 
in the middle of an estuary. The greatest height of 
the flood is marked, by an inscription cut on the wall 
at the east end of the south entrance to the Public 
Offices. A young woman of the Gorbals lost her life 
by this flood, many cattle were drowned, and much 
merchandise destroyed.

The unfavourable harvest of 1782 occasioned a

and it moved in a direction from north-east to south¬ 
west with inconceivable velocity. Its light was so 
strong and brilliant, that a pin might have been pick¬ 
ed up on the street; and, what is remarkable, it was 
seen over all Britain nearly at the same instant—a 
proof that its height must have been very great. 

The winter of 1784-5 was distinguished by a se¬ 
vere frost of long continuance. It lasted four months, 
when, on the 14th of March, the ice broke upon the 
Clyde. Its duration at London was still longer, be¬ 
ing no less than five months and twenty-four days, 
the longest period of the permanence of frost upon 
record. 

In the latter end of the same year, 1785, the in¬ 
habitants of Glasgow were, for the first time, amused 
by the ascent of an air-balloon. This was conducted 
by Lunardi, * the celebrated aeronaut. He ascended, 
on Wednesday the 23d of November, from St. An¬ 
drew’s Square, at five minutes from two o’clock, p. m. 
and descended at fifty-five minutes past three of the 
same afternoon, near the water of Ale, about five miles 
beyond Hawick, after having traversed the space of 
one hundred and two miles, in the space of two hours. 
In a second attempt, on the 5th of December, he was 


* Vincent Lunardi, an Italian, was the first who accomplished an aerial 
voyage in Great Britain. The ascent took place in England, during Sep¬ 
tember, 1784. His balloon was thirty-three feet in diameter, and shaped 
like a pear. It was made of oiled silk, with alternate stripes of blue and 
red, having the car suspended from a hoop, below the balloon, by forty-five 
cords.

carried northward to the neighbourhood of the Cam£&gt;- 
sie-hiils, where his aerial voyage terminated. 

On the 11th of August, 1786, a slight shock of an 
earthquake was felt in the city and, at the same time, 
in various places of Scotland. On the 21 st of Decem¬ 
ber, the cold was sq intense, that the thermometer 

; 

stood at 20 degrees below the freezing point. 

The peace of the city was disturbed, in 1787* by 
a riot, in which the journeymen weavers were chiefly 
engaged. Their object was to force their employers 
to raise their wages. To accomplish this, they not 
only refused to work themselves; but, assembling in 
a mob, they proceeded to molest their more peaceable 
brethren by every act of outrage. The magistrates 
and other peace-officers, supported by a party of the 
39th regiment under the command of Lieutenant- 
Colonel Kellet, endeavoured to dissuade them from 
their violent purposes. Such lenity, however, only 
provoked the insolence of the rioters, who were not 
finally suppressed, till, by a fire from the military, 
after the riot act had been read, three persons were 
killed, three mortally, and three slightly wounded. 
After this they immediately dispersed; and, although 
they several times assembled afterwards, yet the ap¬ 
proach of soldiers always made them retire. 

On the 5th of November, 1788, the city was splen¬ 
didly illuminated in commemoration of the Revolu¬ 
tion consummated by the accession of William and 
Mary to the British crowns, since which remarkable 
period, a hundred years had just then elapsed. The 
day was observed as a public thanksgiving, when the

ministers delivered most appropriate historical dis¬ 
courses, fraught with much useful information, and 
deducing the most happy conclusions, by a compa¬ 
rison of past with the present times. 

An alarming incident occurred in the city on the 
8th of February, 1793. This was the destruction 
of the Laigh Kirk by fire, supposed to have arisen 
from the carelessness of some persons then on guard; 
the session-house being at that time used by the ci¬ 
tizens as a guard-room. Unluckily the damage was 
not confined to the destruction of the church. The 
records of the General Session, lodged there, were 
entirely consumed, and the register of the proceed¬ 
ings of the presbytery greatly injured. 

Disturbances, similar to those of 1787j occurred 
in 1794, from a different cause. A deserter had es¬ 
caped from the guard-house; and it was supposed 
that the sentinel, a soldier in a Fencible regiment 
raised and commanded by the Earl of Breadalbane, 
had been negligent in the discharge of his duty. He 
was therefore tried and condemned. By a mutin¬ 
ous combination of his fellow soldiers, however, the 
sentence w r as prevented from being put in execution. 
Troops were, therefore, collected from the neighbour¬ 
hood to quell the mutineers, but before they arrived 
the ringleaders surrendered themselves, and were 
conducted prisoners to Edinburgh. Major Leslie and 
another officer of the Breadalbane regiment having 
accompanied the party that guarded them, a short 
way out of town, were attacked by a mob on their 
return, and obliged to flee for safety. The major

was wounded, and the house to which he and the 
other officer had fled w r as beset by an enraged mul¬ 
titude, which w r as not dispersed till the arrival of the 
magistrates, the peace-officers, and a military guard. 
Four of the mutineers were sentenced to be shot by 
a General Court-Martial held at Edinburgh; only 
one of them, however, suffered death. 

When the public security had become in danger 
from the diffusion of revolutionary principles, and 
the liberties, and even the existence, of other states 
had been threatened by the sanguinary designs of the 
French Republic, the Legislature of Great Britain 
was obliged, as the means of self-defence, to sum¬ 
mon into requisition every national resource. For 
this purpose, was passed an Act of Parliament, per¬ 
mitting a restricted number of the vigorous and pa¬ 
triotic friends of their country to embody themselves 
into corps, under the name of Volunteers. Glasgow, 
with her usual enterprise and gallantry, instantly 
obeyed the call. Her sons crowded round the stan¬ 
dard of freedom, being incited by the fame of their 
city, and animated by the renown of their native 
land. Accordingly, in January 1795 , a complete 
battalion was organized, under Colonel Corbett, their 
elected commander, which discharged its duties with 
promptitude and honour so long as its services were 
required. 

On the 18th of November, 1795&gt; the lower part of 
the city was subjected to another alarming inunda¬ 
tion of the Clyde. It rose to nearly the same height 
as in 1782, and the inhabitants were subjected to an

equal degree of distress. Besides, by the impetuosi¬ 
ty of its current, an elegant new stone bridge, thrown 
across the river opposite to the Saltmarket, and which 
had occupied more than a year and a half in the build¬ 
ing, was overturned and completely destroyed. For¬ 
tunately, however, amid so much danger, only one 
boy was drowned. 

The Volunteers, in 1797; were increased to ten 
companies, and other two corps were raised, the 
second of which consisted of elderly gentlemen. A 
troop of Volunteer Cavalry was also embodied in the 
city, and commanded by the late John Orr, Esq. of 
Barrowfield. 

The city suffered much, in 1799 and 1800, from a 
scarcity of provisions produced by the failure of the 
harvest. A subscription, begun and promoted by 
the magistrates, was liberally filled up by the bene¬ 
volent, who sympathized much with the public dis¬ 
tress. Oatmeal sold for some time at 3s. 6d. and 3s. 
9d. per peck. 

A new and well regulated system of Police was 
established, in 1800, within the city, and has since 
proved the source of much security to the peaceable 
inhabitants. 

The termination, in 1801, of the destructive war 
which had, during many years, agitated Europe, ren¬ 
dered the longer services of the Volunteers unneces¬ 
sary. With the approbation of Parliament, speaking 
the language of a grateful nation, the different corps 
were accordingly reduced. At this period the first 
regiment of Glasgow Volunteers had become posses-

is ever the associate of true heroism, presented to the

The University was greatly endangered, in 1803, 
by the malignant passions of a mob excited, no doubt, 
by the practices of some ill-designing men. Suspi¬ 
cions having arisen that a body had been taken from 
its grave for anatomical purposes; and, these being 
speedily disseminated, a tumultuous assemblage of 
people collected before the College, where, soon pro¬ 
ceeding to acts of violence and outrage, they broke 
all the windows in its front. This occurred on a 
Sunday evening; and a repetition of the same on 
Monday, was only prevented by the appearance of 
a troop of dragoons from Hamilton, which soon dis-

persed the rioters, without any accident, and re-es¬ 
tablished order and tranquillity. 

When the republican tyranny of France compelled 
every Briton to arm in defence of his liberty and 
existence, Glasgow, among the first, took her post 
with ardour and alacrity. The French had now bent 
their necks to a bold and enterprising chief, whose 
gigantic ambition threatened the best interests of the 
neighbouring states; and a short-lived peace had on¬ 
ly nursed the seeds of a fiercer war, when, in 1803, 
the country was again summoned to resume its arms. 
On this occasion Glasgow furnished six volunteer 
battalions of various strength, and a troop of caval¬ 
ry, several of which provided their own clothes and 
arms. But the enterprise was in defence of every 
thing dear to the human soul —fortune, friends, 

LIFE, AND LIBERTY ! 

“ O Liberty ! thou soul-enlivening name. 

Thy forms how various, yet thy powers the same: 

From thee the fields assume their smiling face. 

The notes their music, and the paint its grace. 

Thine are the plastic arts that mould the bust. 

And breathe its beauties o’er the dome august; 

Is there a bard who feels thy just control ? 

The muse pours all her godhead on his soul— 

She prompts the sigh, she swells the impassion’d gush. 

Glows in his warmth and reddens in his blush; 

The blush, that o’er an honest cheek stream? fair. 

When mortals hug the shameful chains they wear. 

’Tis thine to arm, when nations stand aghast. 

The free-born soul, impetuous as the blast; 

Inspir’d by thee, each Briton flew to arms. 

And every heart beat high with war’s alarms.” 

The Steam-boat, as a trial of its power, on Monday, 
the 28th t&gt;f March, 1803, took in drag two loaded 
brigs, the burden of both not less than 130 tons, and

carried them with ease from Lock, No. 20, through 
the long reach of 18 J miles, to Port-Dundas, though 
it blew, most part of the way, a strong breeze right 
a-head of them. 

A grand Review took place on Wednesday, the 3d 
of October, on the Green, under the Earl of Moira, 
commander in chief of the forces in Scotland. The 
Stirlingshire Militia, and the whole volunteer force of 
the city and neighbourhood, amounting to about 4000 
men, were then assembled. Besides his Lordship and 
suite, were present General Wemyss, commander of 
the Western district, and his suite, together with ma¬ 
ny noblemen, gentlemen, and general officers, with 
an immense concourse of spectators. 

Gas, obtained by the distillation of coal, wood, and 
other inflammable substances, being found by diffe¬ 
rent experiments to burn with a steady light and a 
high degree of brilliancy, had already been attempted 
to be introduced for the purpose of lighting shops, 
and other public works. With the design therefore, 
of ascertaining the extent of its use and efficacy, on 
the evenings of Saturday and Monday, the 8th and 
10th of October, 1805, the front of the Exchange 
was illuminated, on this principle, with a brightness 
and splendour greatly superior to that of the com¬ 
mon lamps. In consequence of the success which 
afterwards attended the introduction of Gas-liMit, 
for the purpose of illuminating the streets, shops, 
and houses in London, a company was established 
in Glasgow for a similar purpose, and incorporated 
by Act of Parliament. The bill passed the House

of Lords on the lbth of June, 1817, and immediate¬ 
ly thereafter the proprietors began their operations, 
purchased a large piece of ground in Kirk-street, 
near the High Church, immediately behind the old 
Trades’-hall, erected a gasometer and offices, and 
laid cast-iron pipes along the principal streets, for 
conveying the Gas to the extremities of the city^.— 
The subscription for this undertaking was very ra¬ 
pidly filled up, in shares of £25 each; the full amount 
subscribed in December, 1817, being £21,000. The 
citizens of Glasgow were the first to follow the ex¬ 
ample of those of London, in the introduction of this 
beautiful and useful invention, and they have since 
been followed by the principal cities in the empire. 

On Saturday, the pth of November, 1805, in con¬ 
sequence of the news of Lord Nelson’s glorious naval 
victory off Trafalgar, the regulars, military, and dif¬ 
ferent volunteer corps in town, paraded in the Green 
at 2 o’clock, p. m. and fired a feu de joye in honour 
of the occasion. In the evening, the city displayed 
a brilliant illumination, when many ingenious figu¬ 
rative transparencies were exhibited. But the tur¬ 
bulent joy of triumph was tempered by regret for 
the Hero, who had finished his illustrious career in 
the bosom of victory; and, while the thrill of admi¬ 
ration of his deeds played around the heart, the tear 
of sorrow glistened in the eye, speaking, at the same 
time, the greatness of his country’s loss, and the just¬ 
ness of his wide-extended fame.

Harbour, was laid with much pomp and ceremony

on the 31st of July, 1806, by William Blair of Blair, 
Esq. the Grand Master of the Ancient Mother-Lodge, 
Kilwinning, in the presence of the Earl of Eglinton, 
and a great assemblage of nobility and gentry from 
different parts of the country. 

The Bay of Ardrossan, formed by an ample ridge 
of rocks, and an island of considerable size, is front¬ 
ed on the south-east at some distance from the shore, 
by a bold insulated range of rocky ground, which is 
crowned with the venerable ruins of the ancient cas¬ 
tle of Ardrossan. From the summit adjacent to the 
castle is commanded a view of the whole Bay of Ayr, 
and the romantic rock of Ailsa rising out of the Frith 
of Clyde. An extended and level coast, towards the 
south-east, exhibits a succession of thriving towns 
and villages, bounded by a gently rising amphithea¬ 
tre of highly cultivated country, while the turrets of 
Eglinton castle, rising amid extensive woods, mark 
the magnificent abode of the Baron. Towards the 
north and west, the picturesque mountains of Arran 
and Argyleshire are finely contrasted with the smooth 
lakes and bays of the ocean, and, associated with the 
rich and beautiful country on the banks of the Clyde, 
form a picture pleasing, interesting, and sublime. 

This noble bay is the outlet, on the Clyde, of the 
canal between Glasgow and Ardrossan, and is de¬ 
signed to form a commodious harbour, well adapted 
to promote the intercourse between this country and 
Ireland. In the foundation-stone were deposited, one

The projected course of the Ardrossan Canal tra¬ 
verses an extent of nearly 33 miles. It has 30 feet, 
in breadth, of water-way, and is 4| deep. From 
Port-Eglinton in Tradeston, it proceeds on a level of 
38 feet above the surface of the Clyde, at high water, 
through a difficult range of 10 miles, to the village 
of Johnstone, beyond which its line has not been 
opened. At this place 8 locks will raise it 6 4 feet, 
to its highest elevation, and 13 conduct its descent 
into the north-east extremity of the inner harbour of 
Ardrossan. The cut from Glasgow to Johnstone was 
executed at an expense of £l 10,000, a proportion of 
which was paid by 884 shares of £50 each, and the 
balance by a borrowed sum. The annual revenue in 
1815 amounted to £3044: 3: 8, and continues gra-

dually to increase. Exclusively of trading vessels, 
three boats * navigate this Canal, for the conveyance 
of passengers. They are 68 feet long and 8 wide 
each, and are adapted to the reception of one hun¬ 
dred and twenty persons. 

Upwards of £40,000 have already been expended 
on Ardrossan harbour, and, when finished, it will 
consist of an outer harbour three quarters of a mile 
long, and 300 yards wide, capable of receiving 
twenty ordinary sized vessels, or about 10,000 tons; 
and an inner harbour, or wet dock, capable of con¬ 
taining from seventy to a hundred vessels, or about 
30,000 tons. The Glasgow canal is to enter at the 
north-east extremity. Close by the wall or quay 
there is 27 feet depth of water at ebb tide, the bot¬ 
tom sloping gradually for a mile to the beach. Ac¬ 
cording to the original plan, the quay is to consist 
of a south pier 600 yards long, and a north pier 350 
yards: the breadth 25 yards, to admit of a street 15 
yards, or 45 feet in width, leaving 10 yards for 
warehouses. There are also to be two dry docks, 
one of which is nearly finished, of the most superior 
workmanship and accommodation. It is 108^ feet 


* One of these leaves Port-Eglinton at ten o’clock a. m. another at four 
p. M. and a third at six p. m. One starts from Paisley at nine A. m. another 
at ten A. M. and one at five P. M. One leaves Johnstone at nine A. m. and 
another at four p. m. The fare to Paisley, in the first cabin is Is. 3d., in the 
second Is. To Johnstone Is. 9d., and Is. 2d. The passage is generally per¬ 
formed within the space of two hours. During the time of Martinmas fair, 
a very afflicting accident happened on Saturday, November 10th, 1810, from 
one of the boats being overset in the basin of Paisley, by the sudden rush of 
nearly two hundred people upon her deck. The greater part of these was 
precipitated into the Canal, and eighty-four of the number drowned.

long at bottom, 120 feet at top; 31 feet broad at 
bottom, 63 at top. The bottom of the dock is 3 feet 
under the level of low water, and the sill of the 
flood-gates 11 feet under the level of high water in 
ordinary tides, so that a vessel drawing 11 feet can 
enter the dock. The opening of the gates is 36 feet 
wide, and consequently will admit a vessel 35 feet 
over. The other dock is intended to be considera¬ 
bly larger. 

In conjunction with the harbour, the Earl of Eg- 
linton has laid down the town of Ardrossan; many 
streets have been formed, and buildings erected in 
a simple and elegant plan. Among others, an ele¬ 
gant tontine and baths. When the canal and har¬ 
bour, with the other plans, are completed, the whole 
will do much honour to the enterprising public spirit 
of the Earl of Eglinton. 

In 1806 died the Right Honourable William Pitt, 
who, during twenty-six years, held the distinguished 
situation of Prime Minister of Great Britain. To 
commemorate their sense of his eminent patriotism, 
his magnanimous contempt of private interest, and 
his unrivalled abilities, the citizens of Glasgow 
opened a subscription to raise a monument to his 
memory. This soon amounted to &lt;£1300; and a 
full-length marble statue of this virtuous statesman, 
by the chisel of Mr. John Flaxman, a distinguished 
sculptor of London, was instantly commissioned. 
This was erected in the Town-hall in 1812, and re¬ 
presents the patriot in a plain dress: it bears this 
inscription:

The city visited by repeated storms.—Comet of 1807. 


GULIELMO PITT, 

CIVES GLASGUF.NSIS 
POSUERUNT, 

&gt; A. D. MDCCCXII. 

The city, on Tuesday, August 18, 1807, between 
three and four o’clock, p. m., was the scene of a vio¬ 
lent storm of rain, hail, lightning, and thunder. 
The streets were inundated with torrents; and, 
amid the cataracts of hail and rain, fell several large 
pieces of ice. Many panes of glass w ere broken, 
and skv-lights and cupolas dashed in pieces. 

An incessant heavy fall of rain, from nine o’clock 
on the night of Saturday, September 5th, till eight 
on that of Sunday, swelled the Clyde to a greater 
height than it had attained for the last twelve years, 
, when the new bridge was destroyed. The lower 
streets of the city were laid under water, and pas¬ 
sage by the bridges for those on foot was obstructed. 
Much grain, and several cattle, were forcibly swept 
away by the stream from the lovr-grounds on its 
banks. Tw r o arches of the bridge over the Clyde 
near Hamilton, on the road from that place to Edin¬ 
burgh, fell on Sunday. A young man in a boat near 
the Clyde Iron-works, and another in the Green, lost 
their lives when attempting to secure some of the 
floating grain. 

A comet made its appearance, during October, in 
the northern hemisphere, and was observed in vari¬ 
ous places with much interest. The subjoined in¬ 
formation, respecting such a remarkable visitant, 
may not be unacceptable to the young astronomer. 
It is the result of accurate observations made at Pa-

ris, Greenwich, and the Observatory of Glasgow 
College, which gave the following elements of the 
comet’s orbit. 

1st. It was at its nearest distance to the sun, or, 
in astronomical language, it passed its perihelion at 
six o’clock a. m. of the 19th September. 2d. The 
longitude of its ascending node, or the distance 
measured on the ecliptic from the point Aries, where 
its orbit crossed that of the earth, was 8 signs, 26 
degrees, 46 minutes. 3d. Its orbit w r as inclined to 
the terrestrial 63 degrees 10 minutes. 4th. The 
place of the perihelion passage was 9 signs and 1 
minute. 5th. Its perihelion distance was 6l^ mil¬ 
lions of miles from the sun, the mean distance of the 
earth being 95 millions. 

Glasgow was hitherto imperfectly provided with 
good water, and various schemes had been proposed 
to supply that deficiency. With this view, an Act 
of Parliament w r as obtained, in 1806, establishing a 
body under the name of the Glasgow water-work 
company, under whose direction, water was to be 
carried into the city from the Clyde, on a plan pro¬ 
duced by Mr. Thomas Telford, an ingenious engineer. 
A fund was, therefore, formed by shares of £50 
each, when the works were immediately begun with 
vigour. An extensive erection for the purpose of 
filtration was raised at Dalmarnock, about two miles 
up the river, whence water, in the purest state, is 
now conveyed in large pipes to two reservoirs in the 
immediate vicinity of the tow r n. One of these, of 
great extent, is formed at Sidney-street, near the

east end of the Gallowgate; the other is in the Rot- 
tenrow, at the head of the town. From these the 
city has been abundantly supplied since May 1808, 
at which period an experiment on the efficiency of 
the pipes and other works was first attempted. This 
arduous undertaking has now cost upwards of 
£100,000. The shares in this Company have risen 
progressively, and in March 1818 sold at £100 per 
share. The dividend paid in August 1817, was 
£3 : 5 per share. 

During the same year, a Bill was passed by Par¬ 
liament incorporating another Company, under the 
name of the cranston-hill water-work company, 
whose erections were shortly afterwards completed, 
at an expense of £ 60 , 000 . The Cranston-hill Com¬ 
pany draw the water from a tunnel running parallel 
with the river, at a distance of from 60 to 80 feet 
from it, at Finnieston, about a mile and a half below 
the city, where it is forced up by two engines of 
twenty-five horse power each, at the rate of 2200 
gallons per minute, to the reservoir on Cranston-hill, 
at the west end of Anderston, where it is again fil¬ 
tered. * 


* The waters of the two Companies were lately analyzed by Professor 
Thomson, of this University, and found to be precisely the same, and to 
consist of the water of the Clyde in its greatest purity. The composition 
of the residue from 10.000 grains of each water, was as follows:

Serious accident to Glasgow mail-coach. 


55 


A fatal accident happened at ten o’clock on Tues¬ 
day night, the 25th of October, to the Glasgow 
mail-coach which runs to Carlisle, at Avon-brid&lt;re, 
about seven miles from Moffat. An excessive quan¬ 
tity of rain had fallen during the day, and swollen 
the river to a very unusual height, by which means 
the bridge was carried away, but whether before the 
coach was on it, or not, is unknown. The coach, 
horses, passengers, guard, and driver, were all pre¬ 
cipitated into the river, where they remained till as¬ 
sistance could be afforded, when it was found that the 
two outside passengers were killed, and three of the 
inside severely wounded. The other, a lady, escaped 
unhurt, and was found clinging to a piece of the 
bridge. The driver had one of his arms broken in 
two places, and the guard was much injured on the 
head. Three of the horses were found alive next 
morning, but one of them, when taking out, was ac¬ 
cidentally killed by the falling of part of the bridge. 
The generous and spirited humanity of Mr. Geddes, 
of Moffat, was very conspicuous on this occasion. 
With a rope tied round his middle, he went into the 
water, and rescued the lady and others from their 
very perilous situation. In the same manner, he 
recovered the mail, a box belonging to the lady, 
containing money to a considerable amount, and 
some other articles pertaining to the passengers. 
The mail-coach passing to Glasgow would have 
shared the same fate, had not timely intimation 
prevented its too near approach to the bridge.

56 Improvement of the quay at Broomielaw. 

By the Act of Parliament, passed this year for im¬ 
proving the means of national defence, those who 
had been enrolled to serve as Local Militiarmen, 
were called out to training-duty early in the sum¬ 
mer of 1809. The requisition for Lanarkshire w r as 
distributed into six battalions of 800 men each, ex¬ 
clusive of officers. Of these Glasgow furnished five, 
consisting of young men, animated by loyalty to 
their sovereign, and by zeal in support of the secu¬ 
rity and honour of their country. 

Owing to the great resort of vessels to the Broom¬ 
ielaw, want of room had occasioned much inconve¬ 
nience. A proposal was therefore made, early in 
1809, to improve the harbour, by lengthening the 
present quay and erecting another on the opposite 
side. For this purpose an Act of Parliament was 
obtained, and the -work is now finished, consisting 
of 900 additional feet, and extends to the limits of 
the Royalty down the river. 

During the winter of 1808-9, the British army in 
Spain had been occupied in a campaign under ad¬ 
verse circumstances, perhaps, unexampled in history. 
At the head of these brave troops was the gallant 
Sir John Moore —a chief, renowned for the intre¬ 
pidity of his valour, the vigour, wisdom, and inde¬ 
pendence of his military skill—and a man, eminent 
for the generosity, amiableness, and sublimity of his 
virtues. Having conducted, in the very depth of 
winter, a matchless retreat, through woods, moun¬ 
tains, and wilds, he engaged the French with a

greatly inferior force, and having defeated them, 
fell, in the moment of victory, on the plains of Co¬ 
runna. * He was buried, without pomp, in the cita¬ 
del of that town. No sooner were the accounts of 
his triumph and his death known at Glasgow, in 
which city he was born, than a subscription was 
opened for raising a monument commemorative of 
the illustrious hero, whose deeds are the proud boast 
of his country, and whose renown reflects a lustre 
on the place of his birth. Above &lt;£4000 have been 
subscribed to erect, to his memory, a bronze statue 
upon a pedestal, in some conspicuous part of the 
city, to commemorate the heroic achievements of 
the hero, t 


* On the spot where he fell, the Marquis Romana and the other officers 
of an army of Spanish patriots, have erected a small but elegant cenotaph 
to his memory. 

f In 1815, an elegant and chaste statue by Mr. Bacon was erected in St. 
Paul’s Cathedral, London, to the memory of Sir John Moore. The artist 
has made the base of the monument an open grave. A fine figure of Fame 
is kneeling over the dead hero, who is descending to the tomb in his military 
costume, and adorned with all his honorary decorations. While Fame en¬ 
twines her laurel around him, a stooping muscular figure is in the act of 
laying him in the grave. Above this group, a boy holds the British flag, 
and a shield, bearing the arms of Spain, denotes the cause and the scene of 
his glory. The simple but impressive words of the inscription are,

Celebration of the Jubilee.—Fracture of Nelson’s monument. 


58 

On the 25th of October, our venerable sovereign, 
George III. entered into the fiftieth year of his reign. 
To celebrate the auspicious sera, the day was observed 
as a Jubilee within his Majesty’s British dominions. 
The Magistrates of Glasgow, accompanied by the 
clergy, the different public bodies, and the officers of 
the Local Militia, went in procession to St. George’s 
Church, where the Rev. Dr. Porteous delivered an 
appropriate discourse. Thence they returned, in the 
same order, to the Town-hall, where an elegant en¬ 
tertainment was given in the evening. The citizens 
manifested their loyalty in many fanciful transparen¬ 
cies, and the whole was conducted with the greatest 
hilarity and order. The day was concluded with a 
splendid display of fire-works, when the immense 
concourse of spectators retired, peaceful and pleased, 
to their respective dwellings. 

On Sunday afternoon, August 5th, 1810, an alarm¬ 
ing storm of rain, thunder, and lightning, agitated 
the city. About four o’clock, the lightning struck 
the top of Lord Nelson’s monument, and irreparably 
injured it. On the north side, the column is torn 
open, for more than twenty feet from the top, and 
several of the stones thrown down. A rent, on the 
south side, descends to the head of the pedestal. In 
this state it still remains, with a number of stones 
hanging loose, and threatening an immediate down- 
fal. 

Several accidents having repeatedly happened to 
vessels entering the Clyde, the Trustees on the 
Cumbray and Cloch Light-houses resolved to erect a 





Toward Light-house erected.—Branch of Paisley Bank robbed. 59 

building of that description on the Point of Toward, 
which should serve as a leading light, both up and 
down the channel. The foundation-stone of the 
work was, therefore, laid, 2d of July, 1811, by Mr. 
Spreull, superintendent of the Light-houses, in pre¬ 
sence of Duncan M'Naught, Esq. one of the magis¬ 
trates of Greenock, Mr. Burnet, master of the works 
in that town, J. Anderson, Esq. of Rothsay, and Mr. 
Napier, contractor for the work. Mr. Lamond of 
Knockdow, to promote so useful an undertaking, 
in a very disinterested manner gave what ground, 
freestone, and lime, w r as necessary to complete the 
design. By this means the navigation to Greenock, 
Port-Glasgow, and Glasgow, has received an impor¬ 
tant increase to its convenience and security. 

A depredation of a most audacious nature was 
committed, in the same month, within the city. Some 
time between the evening of Saturday the 13th and 
the morning of Monday the 15th, the Office of the 
branch of the Paisley Union Bank established here, 
was entered by means of false keys, and notes and 
cash, exceeding ,£20,000, carried off, without any 
violence having been done either to the locks of the 
doors or of the desks. A reward of 500 guineas was 
offered for the discovery of the perpetrators. 

In consequence of the scarcity of silver in the 
country. Government had directed the coinage and 
issue of 3s. pieces under the name of Bank Tokens. 
Of these, in the month of August, to the amount of 
£11,000 were transmitted to the Lord Provost, by

the Governor of the Bank of England, for the use 
of the city of Glasgow and its neighbourhood. 

To give additional interest to the Picture, the 
comet which, in the autumn of this year, excited 
universal interest, requires a cursory notice. It was 
first observed, in Glasgow, by Mr. Denholm on the 
first of September soon after sunset. The following 
observations mark its first approximation, and are 
the result of calculations made by Dr. Ure, then 
superintendent of the Observatory, and Mr. Cross, 
teacher of mathematics in the Andersonian Institu¬ 
tion.

a spectator on the earth. 

Navigation of vessels by the impulse of concen¬ 
trated steam is of recent origin. Mr. Millar of Dal- 
swinton, in 1785, constructed a boat with two keels, 
between which the paddle-wheels, propelled by 
steam, were placed. Unforeseen difficulties, how- 




Various attempts to perfect the steam-boat—Mr. Bell successful. (jl 

ever, obliged him to drop the experiment while in¬ 
complete. In 1791, the patriotic Earl Stanhope 
made a similar, and unsuccessful, attempt with pad¬ 
dles arranged on the vessel’s quarter. Mr. Syming¬ 
ton, in 1801, tried the power of a steam-boat on the 
Forth and Clyde Canal, but soon laid it aside, on 
account of the injury done to the banks by its action 
on the water. The same invention was prosecuted 
and further matured by Mr. Robert Fulton, a North- 
Ameriean, who, on October 3d, 1807, launched a 
steam-boat on the river Hudson. It was success¬ 
fully employed in conveying passengers and goods 
between New-York and Albany. Others were built 
in the same country, on improved principles; and 
more lately, a steam-frigate, named Fulton the First, 
in honour of the projector, has been added to the 
American navy. Mr. Henry Bell, a self-taught en¬ 
gineer of Glasgow, in the beginning of 1812, di¬ 
rected his attention to the steam-propelling system 
of navigation, and reduced it to practice on the 
Clyde. After trying numerous experiments, and 
surmounting many obstacles, he completed the Co¬ 
met, a boat impelled by an engine originally of three, 
afterwards of six horse power. His success soon en¬ 
couraged others to become rivals in the advantages 
and improvements of his plan; and steam-boats, * 


* The intercourse between Glasgow and the various ports and islands in 
the Clyde has been by these vessels increased in an almost incredible degree. 
It is no uncommon thing in the summer season for three vessels in the 
course of a single forenoon to land upwards of five hundred passengers, of 
all ages, at the Broomielaw.

Independent of the above, a considerable number (built on the shores of 
the Clyde) have gone to London, Ireland, Leith, Stirling, and other places 
in Scotland. The size of the engines for these boats is from 12 to 34 horse 
power. The following particulars of the cost of the Albion, will give an 
idea of the value of steam-boats.

The steam-boats usually perform the passage of 24 miles, between Glas¬ 
gow and Greenock, in three hours. The cabin fare is four shillings, that of 
the steerage two shillings and sixpence.. In the cabins, which are fitted up 
with great elegance, a selection of books and periodical works is placed for 
the use of the passengers, who can be accommodated with breakfast, din¬ 
ner, or tea, if required. 
















Discontents among weavers.—Subscription in aid of Russian sufferers. 65 




elapsed before all their bodies were recovered from 
the ruins. 

In the end of this, and beginning of next year, a 
systematic attempt of the operative weavers in Glas¬ 
gow and the West of Scotland, to procure a law de¬ 
termining the rates of their wages, together with 
the measures adopted in prosecution of their object, 
filled the minds of the peaceable inhabitants with 
anxiety and dread. It was defeated, however, by 
the impracticability of their claims. 

Five thousand two hundred and four pounds, 
sterling, raised in Glasgow by subscription, for the 
benefit of such of the Russian people as had suffered 
most from the invasion of their country by the 
French, was transmitted, in May 1813, by Kirkman 
Finlay, Esq., M. P., Lord Provost of the city, to 
the commissioners appointed at St. Petersburgh to 
conduct its distribution. 

I 

Vittoria, on June 21st of this year, became the 
scene of one of Lord Wellington’s most glorious 
achievements. There, he defeated the French un¬ 
der Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jourdan. Among 
the many gallant soldiers who fell on that eventful 
day, was the Honourable Henry Cadogan, Lieute¬ 
nant-colonel of the 71st, or Glasgow Highland Re¬ 
giment, whose urbanity and heroism had endeared 
him to many of the respectable inhabitants of this 
city. Commemorative, therefore* of his virtues, his 
friends in Glasgow have erected a marble monu¬ 
ment in the choir of the cathedral, on which is the 
following inscription:

Successive rejoicings for the victories of 1814. 


SACRED TO THE MEMORY 
OF THE 

HONOURABLE HENRY CADOGAN, 
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL OF THE LXXI. OR GLASGOW REGIMENT, 

AND HONORARY BURGESS OF THIS CITY, 

WHO GLORIOUSLY FELL AT THE HEAD OF HIS BATTALION, 

IN THE EVER-MEMORABLE BATTLE OF VITTORIA, JUNE XXI, MDCCCXIII, 
AGED THIRTY-THREE YEARS. 

THIS STONE IS ERECTED 

BY A FEW OF HIS FRIENDS IN THIS CITY AND NEIGHBOURHOOD, 

TO PERPETUATE THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS 
WORTH AS A MAN, 

AND OF HIS 

GALLANTRY AS A SOLDIER. 


November 9th of the same year was devoted, in 
many parts of Scotland, to rejoicings on account of 
the splendid success of the Allies over the French 
at Leipsic. In the evening, the city of Glasgow 
and its populous suburbs were brilliantly illumin¬ 
ated, when many picturesque exhibitions of exulta¬ 
tion were displayed. 

Disease and death made uncommon ravages among 
the inhabitants, especially the aged, in the early part 
of 1814. From January 1st to February 8th, inclu¬ 
sive, the number of burials in the different church¬ 
yards of the city and suburbs, amounted to 658, 
being nearly one-fourth of (2704) what had taken 
place in the preceding year. 

Eighteen hundred and fourteen was a year of 
great events throughout Europe—throughout the 
world. The triumphs of the British in Spain, and 
of the Russians in repelling the French invasion of 
their country, aroused the spirit of other nations to 
assert or to recover their independency. The im¬ 
pulse was simultaneous and irresistible; and before 
it fell even the genius of Bonaparte. The accession 
of Louis XVIII. to the Gallic throne was hailed as

the harbinger of peace and of rest. General rejoic¬ 
ings celebrated the epoch in the neighbouring king¬ 
doms. Tuesday, April 12th, was devoted by the 
citizens of Glasgow to the expression of joy and 
victory. The troops fired a feu de joie in the Green, 
amid the acclamations of numberless spectators. 
Banners and white ensigns were displayed in many 
parts of the town. Emblematic paintings, martial 
music, bonfires, and a general illumination, testified 
the delight of a people, happy in the prospect of 
universal repose .—Aspera jam positis mitescunt secula 
bellis. 

Misfortune never appealed in vain to the bene¬ 
volence of Glasgow. Amid her numerous and 
extensive local charities, she is not inattentive to 
the calamities of other lands. Germany had been 
repeatedly desolated by the troops of France, and 
the cries of her distress were heard on the shores of 
the Clyde. Towards mitigating the sufferings of 
her people, £4534: 7: 8 was contributed by sub¬ 
scription, and, on July 6th, sent from this city to 
London, to the friends of those whom it was de¬ 
signed to relieve. 

A beautiful aurora borealis was seen at Glasgow, 
as well as many other places, on the 11th Septem¬ 
ber, at seven o’clock in the evening. It exhibited 
many variations of form—it played in that of con¬ 
centric zones around the magnetic north pole; it 
darted coruscations in all directions; it exhibited 
all the colours of the rainbow, while the firmament 
seemed in a general blaze. It was attended with

the crackling noise reckoned one of the true auroral 
characteristics. At midnight it disappeared. The 
barometer was 30° 14', and the thermometer 46°, of 
Fahrenheit’s scale, during its presence in the nor¬ 
thern sky. 

On the nineteenth of the following month, a me¬ 
teor of a different class attracted the attention and 
gave an afternoon’s amusement to the people of 
Glasgow. Mr. Saddler, junior, ascended in a bal¬ 
loon from the Grammar-school yard, at three o’clock 
p. m., amid a great concourse of spectators. His 
aerial voyage terminated in thirty-five minutes, at 
Milngavie, seven and a half miles distant, in a nor- 
thernly direction. 

Humanity to those who suffer in the just cause of 
their country, is the most rational expression of ap¬ 
plause and triumph. This principle was displayed 
throughout Britain, in 1815, with an effect un¬ 
exampled and sublime. Peace was won from an 
enemy alike bold and powerful, by the matchless 
valour of our troops on the plain of Waterloo. Ho¬ 
nour and rewards were lavished on the victors; relief 
and comfort afforded to the maimed; bounty, ample 
and honourable, bestowed on the relations of the 
heroes that fell. The benevolent marks of national 
gratitude were provided by voluntary contributions 
of £518,288 : 9: 11, by the people of the Empire; 
and of this, £7578: 13:4, was sent, in December, 
to the Patriotic Fund * in London, by the citizens

drenched with the blood of the brave, conferred an 
everlasting splendour on the British name! Hal¬

Wellington wept. 

Peace being thus restored to the distracted nations, 
an intercourse of hospitality and friendship soon com¬ 
menced between them. The Archdukes John and 
Louis, of Austria, made a visit to Britain in autumn 
of the present year, and, in all parts, met with the 
respect and honours due to their rank. They came 
to Glasgow. There, they inspected every place, 
whether private establishment or public institution, 
where curiosity could be gratified or instruction re¬ 
ceived. They pronounced the city to be Le Foyer 
d’Industrie, the focus of industry. December 2d was 
employed by them in viewing the University in all 
its departments. They were attended by the Pro¬ 
fessors, with many noblemen and gentlemen, at the 


of the brave men who fell on that memorable field.—The Widows of pri¬ 
vates have £10 per ann., and £4 per ann. for each child, till it arrives at the 
age of seven years; from that age to fourteen, the child has £15, but then 
it falls under the management of a guardian, who will, in most cases, be the 
parish minister. At the age of fourteen the annuity to children ceases, and 
a donation of £10 is made; and at the age of twenty-one years, a farther 
donation of £30—but to girls on their marriage-day, if that happen earlier. 
The latter payment will be made only in the event of the fund keeping 
pace with the present calculation. This management applies to privates 
only. The widows of corporals have £12, sergeants £14, and sergeant-ma¬ 
jors £20; with a like advance to their children.

sion to the Common Hall. 

The Clyde, on December 30th, rose seventeen feet 
above its common level: the flood of March 12th, 
1782, acquired only four feet more of height. 

An act of Parliament having opened the trade of 
India to certain parts of the Empire, Glasgow was 
not tardy in availing herself of the privilege. In 
February 1816, a fine ship of 600 tons, named the 
Earl of Buckinghamshire, was chartered by James 
Finlay and Company, merchants in this city, on a 
voyage to the East Indies from the Clyde. She re¬ 
turned in April 1817, to Liverpool, from Bombay, 
with a valuable cargo. 

On Sunday, July 21st, the city was thrown into 
consternation by an unexampled storm of rain and 
thunder. The early part of the day was close and 
sultry, with an easterly wind. At three o’clock, p. m., 
the rain intermixed with hail fell in torrents; the 
thunder was loud and frequent, the lightning inces¬ 
sant and vivid. During a quarter of an hour the 
minds of the inhabitants were filled with apprehen¬ 
sion and dread; the streets were inundated to the 
height of two or three feet, and many houses injured 
by the flood. The service was interrupted in many 
of the churches, from which numbers of the people 
ran into the streets in a state of the greatest alarm. 

Originating from the depression of trade, a spirit 
of discontent and insubordination to the laws began 
to show itself, on August 1 st, among the lower orders, 
especially in the Calton. For some days it showed

appearances of being deep-rooted and extensive; but, 
by the exertions of the magistrates, assisted by the 
peace-officers and a detachment of military, it was 
suppressed, and order completely restored. 

The meteor of September was very visible at 
Glasgow, on the twenty-third of that month. Soon 
after sunset, the northern horizon became very lu¬ 
minous with electric light. About seven o’clock, 
p. m., a band of light detached itself from the mass, 
and soon formed a well-defined semi-circular arch 
of brilliant white light, three or four degrees broad, 
and tapering at its extremities to the e. n. e. and 
s. w. points of the sky. It remained stationary, and 
exhibited equal brightness till near ten o’clock, when 
it began gradually to disappear. Another, of similar 
characters, appeared in the following March, in the 
north-east point of the horizon. 

In October, an assemblage of more than 40,000 
persons was collected by public advertisement in a 
field at Thrushgrove, about a mile north from the 
city, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for a 
redress of the national grievances. After several 
appropriate orations, resolutions expressive of the 
sentiments of this meeting were past, and afterwards 
presented to the House of Commons, in the form of 
a petition. The conduct of this immense concourse 
was regulated, throughout the day, by the strictest 
propriety. 

With the object of alleviating the distresses of the 
labouring part of the community, in November, a 
fund was formed by voluntary subscription. Out

of this, temporary relief was afforded to the unem¬ 
ployed, and premiums for the procuring of work. 
Many persons were engaged in preparing metal for 
the adjacent roads at Is. per day, and others in lev¬ 
elling the upper part of the High Green. This fund, 
at March 29 th, 1817, amounted to £ 12,8 71 : 1 : 7, 
and at that time 5140 families, consisting of 25,700 
souls, were supplied from the same benevolent source. 
In aid of this institution, the Archduke Nicholas, of 
Russia, who, in his tour through Great Britain, was 
at Glasgow on December 24th, generously subscribed 
one hundred pounds. 

On February 13th, 1817, the new silver coinage 
of sixpences, shillings, and half crowns, was first 
issued in this city. The civility, regularity, and 
readiness, which accompanied its exchange at the 
different banking offices, obtained the approbation 
and gratitude of all classes of society. 

So great have been the advantages resulting from 
the communication by the Great Canal connecting 
Glasgow with the Forth, and such the profits accru¬ 
ing to the proprietors of Canal Stock,* that they have 
long contemplated the cutting of a Canal to join the 
present one at Lock No. 16 , near Falkirk, to be con¬ 
tinued to Edinburgh: by this means, a line of water 
communication would be established betwixt the two 
first cities of the Kingdom, highly advantageous to 
the interests of both; affording a cheap and easy

conveyance for passengers and goods, improving the 
intermediate country, and holding out the prospects 
of lucrative returns to those embarking in this un¬ 
dertaking. After meeting with that rivalry and 
opposition which generally await the proposal of 
every measure where a variety of interests are con¬ 
cerned, an Act of Parliament was obtained, in June 
1817, for making a Canal from the Lothian road, 
near the city of Edinburgh, to join the Forth and 
Clyde navigation at Lock No. 16 , near Falkirk, to 
be called the Union Canal. The Company was 
incorporated under the name of “ The Edinburgh and 
Glasgow Union Canal Company and its capital de¬ 
clared to be £245,000, in shares of £50 each. The 
Company was empowered to borrow, on the credit of 
the undertaking, £50,000. The shares to be trans¬ 
ferable, and a subscriber to have a vote for every five 
shares, not exceeding fifty. Proprietors are entitled 
to receive, after the work is finished, the entire dis¬ 
tribution of an equal and proportionable part of the 
profits, according to the money paid by them. The 
general meeting of the Proprietors was appointed to 
be held at Edinburgh in the month of August 1817, 
and general assemblies on the first Tuesday of March 
in every year afterwards; these meetings to consist 
of Proprietors or proxies, holding £500 shares. The 
management to be vested in twelve Proprietors, as a 
committee, who must hold five shares each. 

The following are the dimensions of the Union 
Canal:

Some part of the Canal, near the river Carron, may 
be made ten feet deep, and forty yards broad. The 
Canal duties are various on the different commodi¬ 
ties. For limestone, stones for building and paving, 
coals, lime, bricks, slates, dung, and all kinds of 
manure, 2d. per ton per mile; for timber, deals, and 
wood of every kind, 3d. per ton; and for grain and 
goods in general, 4d. per ton per mile. The Com¬ 
mittee may license passage-boats, and fix their fares. 
Pleasure-boats are to be allowed, but, if they pass 
through any lock, they are to pay a tonnage equal 
to a boat of fifteen tons burden. * 

This extensive w 7 ork was begun on Wednesday, 
the 4th March, 1818; on that day, the Committee 
of Management, with a number of the Proprietors, 
proceeded to the west end of Fountainbridge, near 
Edinburgh, the spot fixed on for the basin; there 
they were met by the Engineer and Contractor ; 
and, after an impressive prayer by the Rev. David 
Dickson, Jun., the first spadeful of earth was dug 
by the President of the Company, Mr. Downie of

Between eight and nine o’clock in the evening of 
September 19 th, a beautiful aurora borealis was vi¬ 
sible from this city, and played during more than 
an hour with extreme brilliancy. The evening was 
unusually serene, and the sky very clear: the moon 
at the same time shone with great beauty. It first 
began in a resplendent arch of white light, issuing 
from the east, and darting towards the west, in an 
arch of fifty degrees. Having remained sometime 
in this position, it suddenly burst asunder into de¬ 
tached bodies, its pointed and splendid rays directed

from the magnetic north, while a very rapid motion 
from west to east changed from position to position 
of the luminous bodies. Between nine and ten the 
phenomenon began to decay; and at last terminated 
in a brilliant luminous body towards the north. Af¬ 
ter the coruscations of the meteor, the zenith was 
covered with thin white clouds, apparently charged 
with electric matter. 

Navigation of the Clyde above the bridges had 
always, till November 1817, been reckoned imprac¬ 
ticable. In that month Mr. David Napier, engineer, 
made such alterations on the Marion steam-boat, as 
enabled him to conduct her to the Clyde Iron-works 
against a very strong current. The distance by wa¬ 
ter is upwards of six miles, and the time spent in 
going and coming did not exceed three hours. It is 
calculated that a steam-boat, of equal power, will 
draw six boats from the Broomielaw to the coalery 
farthest up the Clyde, and return with them, each 
loaded with fifty carts of coals, in the space of three 
hours; while, to transport the same quantity, would 
occupy four hours, and require one hundred and fifty 
horses. 


PRINCESS CHARLOTTE. 


All angel now!—Yet little less than all. 

While yet a pilgrim in our world below ! 

What ’vails it us that sweetness to recal. 

Which hid its own to sooth all other wo; 

What ’vails to tell, how Virtue’s purest glow 
Shone yet more lovely in a form so fair! 

And least of all,—what ’vails the world to know. 

That this poor garland, ’twined to deck thy hair, 

Is hung upon thy hearse, to droop and wither there !—

Death of the Princess Charlotte. 75

November 1817 forms an epoch in the general 
and provincial annals of Britain —on the sixth day 
of that month the Princess Charlotte of Wales died. 
—Charlotte-Augusta, the only child of the Prince 
and Princess of Wales, was born in Carlton-House, 
on the seventh of January, 1796. Her childhood 
was nurtured by her mother with watchful solici¬ 
tude. Lady De Clifford, remarkable for her goodness 
and accomplishments, superintended the expansion 
of her youth: her maturer years were guided by 
the Countess-Dowager of Leeds. Her studies were 
directed by the pious and erudite Bishop of Exeter, 
assisted by Dr. Scott, as sub-preceptor, by whom 
they were urged with singular assiduity. Her ac¬ 
quirements, in consequence, were manifold and pre¬ 
eminent. Having completed her nineteenth year, 
her birthday was observed, on January 7* 1815, for 
the first time in court, at Windsor. On May 1st, 
the same j^ear, she was introduced at the Queen’s 
drawing-room, and soon afterwards went to Wey¬ 
mouth * for the benefit of her health. 


* Just before her departure from Weymouth, her Royal Highness being 
at sea in her yacht, the Leviathan, of 74 guns, sailing near, brought to, and 
fired a salute to the royal standard flying; and soon after. Captain Nixon, 
who commanded her, rowed on board the yacht, to pay his respects to the 
Princess. She received him on deck, and after the usual ceremonies, said 
—“ Captain Nixon, your’s seems a very fine ship of war, I should like much 
to go on board her.” The Bishop, her aged preceptor, standing by, asked 
whether she thought her Illustrious Father might not disapprove of her pas¬ 
sing in an open boat through a rough sea ? The immediate answer to this 
was—“ Queen Elizabeth took great delight in her navy, and was not afraid 
to go on board of a man-of-war in an open boat; then, why should I ? Pray, 
Captain Nixon, have the goodness to receive me in your barge, and let me 
be rowed on board the Leviathan; for I am not only desirous but determined

76 Interesting anecdote of the Princess Charlotte. 

The Prince of Orange, who, by situation and ha¬ 
bits, had become more than half an Englishman, 
was before this period proposed to her as a husband ; 
but of the arrangement she expressed a modest but 
firm disapproval. In 1814, Prince Leopold ofSaxe- 
Cobourg visited England in the train of the Allied 
Sovereigns. He had distinguished himself as an 
officer in the war then concluded: he was honour¬ 
able and amiable, and his graceful manners attracted 
the young princess. Familiar intercourse between 
them improved the first impression into a warmer 
sentiment, and esteem gave place to love. On May 
2d, 1816, their marriage, a marriage of freewill and 
sentiment, was solemnized. On this occasion, the 


to inspect her.” The necessary preparations were made, and her Royal High¬ 
ness passed down into Captain Nixon’s barge, followed by her two Ladies in 
attendance, with the Bishop; and, coming alongside the Leviathan, the yards 
were instantly maimed, and a chair of state let down. The Princess desired 
it to be re-hoisted, saying, “ I prefer going up in the manner that a seaman 
does; you, Captain Nixon, will kindly follow me, taking care of my clothes; 
and, when I am on deck, the chair may be let down for the other Ladies 
and the Bishop.” No sooner said than done; and her Royal Highness as¬ 
cended with a facility that astonished the whole delighted crew. The royal 
suite being upon deck, the ship’s officers were severally introduced. Her 
Royal Highness expressed great surprise at the space and strength of the ship, 
and remarked—“ Well might such noble structures be called the Wooden 
Walls of Old England!” She now told Captain Nixon, that she should not 
be satisfied with an introduction to his state cabin, as she was very anxious 
to see every part of his ship between decks, and even below ; accordingly he 
accompanied her Royal Highness down, when she inspected every birth, 
cockpit, powder-magazine, store-holds, &lt;Src.; and, on her return upon deck, 
gave her thanks to Captain Nixon and attendant officers in the most gracious 
terms, assuring them, that they had afforded an exhibition of more interest 
to her mind than any she had hitherto beheld. The Princess having pre¬ 
sented a purse to Captain Nixon, desiring him to apply it for the crew, as a 
token of her respect for them, descended down the ship’s side as she rose, 
under a royal salute, and the more gratifying cheers of a loyal and hearty 
crew of a British man-of-war. 



Marriage settlement of the Princess Charlotte. 




77 

favours of the Court were crowded upon the Prince: 
he received the Garter, and a regiment of Horse. 
The national bounty was not less generous. A mu¬ 
nificent marriage-settlement was made to the youth¬ 
ful pair. It was 6050,000 a year and for the life of 
the survivor, with &lt;£ 60,000 as an outfit; £ 10,000 
per annum for the independent use of the Princess, 
a splendid set of pearls, and Claremont purchased for 
their residence. 

* 

Declining every interference with public affairs, 
the Prince and Princess, after their marriage, retired 
to Claremont and devoted their sole attention to the 
cultivation of domestic happiness. With the lapse 
of time, their mutual regard increased ; their affec¬ 
tion became still more hallowed and pure. Their 
hours were occupied in embellishing their domains, 
in practising an extensive benevolence, and in im¬ 
proving their literary and moral acquirements. Their 
life was serene and happy—it was the halcyon calm 
before the burst of a storm. 

To the retirement of Claremont, the Princess Char¬ 
lotte drew the eyes of the British nation ; to her 
they looked for a continuation of their regal dynasty, 
for the future heir of their ancient sceptre. On the 
fourth of November, 1817, the Princess became par¬ 
turient ; and, after a tedious labour, was delivered 
in the night of the fifth of a still-born male infant. 
In less than three hours after its birth, the mother, 
whose circumstances at first were favourable, expired, 
to the loss of the British people, and the heart-rend-

ing sorrow of her exemplary and affectionate hus¬ 
band. 

Attended by a magnificent funeral procession, the 
bodies of the Princess and her son, embalmed after 
the usage of their august progenitors, were conveyed 
on Wednesday of the same month from Claremont 
to Windsor, and, with appropriate solemnity, depo¬ 
sited in the royal cemetery. 

Muse! at that name thy sacred sorrows shed; 

Those tears eternal that embalm the dead.

The coffin of the Princess, enclosing one of lead, 
is formed of Honduras mahogany, covered with 
beautiful Genoa crimson velvet, and lined with 
white satin. The gilt metal plate on the lid con¬ 
tains the follow ing inscription:

The inscription is engraven in a simple manner, 
and in no respect distinguished by adventitious or¬ 
nament. It is of an oblong shape, and surrounded 
by a plain border. The coffin, although extremely 
elegant, exhibits no gaudy decorations. A silver 
plate, containing an inscription precisely similar to 
the former, is inserted on the lid of the leaden coffin.

Character of the Princess Charlotte. 79 

An urn contains the heart. It is a simple square 
box of mahogany, and, as well as the infant’s coffin, 
ornamented in the same manner as that of the Prin¬ 
cess. On the lid of the child’s is a plated sheet of 
metal with this inscription: 

THE STILL-BORN MALE INFANT 
OF THEIR 

ROYAL AND SERENE HIGHNESSES 
THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE-AUGUSTA, 

AND OF 

PRINCE LEOPOLD SAXE-COBOURG. 

NOVEMBER G, 1817. 

The person of the Princess Charlotte was noble 
and beautiful. Her character comprehended what¬ 
ever accomplishment is decorative or useful, what¬ 
ever virtue is lovely or excellent. She was acquain¬ 
ted with the chief classic writers, familiar with 
the revolutions and policy of the European govern¬ 
ments, and particularly versant in the constitution 
and distinguishing traits of her native history. She 
displayed a passionate fondness for the best produc¬ 
tions in English poetry. She spoke with fluency 
the French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages. 
She sang and played on the harp, piano, and guitar 
with unusual skill. She had a fine perception of the 
beauties of Nature, was expert in drawing, and wrote 
with ease and gracefulness. Her manner was digni¬ 
fied, but mellowed with much affability. To her do¬ 
mestics she was attentive, equitable, and generous; 
to her trades-people, complaisant and kind; to the 
poor, tender and compassionate. She was a daughter 
most dutiful; a wife, most exemplary and affection¬ 
ate; a princess, truly great and religious. 



80 Glasgow subscribes £225 for a monument to the Princess Charlotte. 

Every person in the British dominions was pro¬ 
foundly penetrated with sorrow for the loss of the 
Princess. Every village and town and city vied 
with each other in demonstrations of regret for her 
fate, and of veneration for her virtues. * In Glasgow, 
as in other populous places, on the day of her inter¬ 
ment, devotional and funeral services were performed 
in all the churches, the lectures in the University 
w T ere discontinued, and the students appeared with 
crapes on the sleeves of their gowns, the shops and 
public offices were shut, the vessels in the river hoist¬ 
ed their colours half-mast high, all the bells w r ere 
tplled at different times, a general and deep mourn¬ 
ing bespoke the sense which was entertained of the 
privation suffered, an air of solemnity was impressed 
on every countenance, and grief seemed implanted 
in every heart. Her greatness and her goodness 
were commemorated in every part of the empire in 
numerous effusions of genius, in prose and in poetry. 

Bright be the place of thy soul! 

No lovelier spirit than thine 
E’er burst from its mortal control. 

In the orbs of the blessed to shine. 

On earth thou wast all but divine. 

As thy soul shall immortally be; 

And our sorrow may cease to repine. 

When we know that thy God is with thee ! 

Lord Byron. 


* So general was the respect felt for the memory of tills Princess, that it 
was resolved to ^rect a national monument to manifest to posterity the re¬ 
gard which her virtue and loyalty had excited; the subscription was limited 
to a guinea, to give to all ranks an opportunity of contributing without 
being eclipsed by those who chose to make parade of their wealth. The 
Committee was established in London, under the denomination of the 
“ Cenotaph Committee,” to whom large and numerous subscriptions were 
transmitted from all parts of the Empire. From this city, in March 1818, 
the sum of £225 was remitted. 




Dreadful storm. 


81 


Upon Monday, the 12th of January, 1818, Glas¬ 
gow was visited by a tempest unequalled in the 
recollection of the oldest resident; the wind, which 
blew with prodigious violence, committed ravages 
numerous and disastrous; several houses were blown 
down, among the rest one of five stories gave way 
to the destructive element; a number of trees, which 
had withstood for years the fury of the elements, 
were torn up by the roots. During the violence of 
the wind, the river Clyde, swollen to a magnificent 
size, exhibited some remarkable appearances; the 
wind, blowing in opposition to the rapid current, 
converted its whole surface into a sheet of foam, and 
clouds of spray, raised sometimes to the height of 
twenty or thirty feet, were driven furiously along. 
Most of the shops in the city were shut up at an 
early hour, and business for some time suspended. 
The wind continued to blow with violence until the 
17th. 

On January 13th, the subscription of £30,000, 
to the Glasgow Gas Light Company, was filled up. 
This sum will enable the Company to extend their 
works to Bridgetown! and Hutchesontown. 


From the preceding sketches, it will be perceived 
that Glasgow, during the lapse of years, has been 
the scene of many important events. Its progres¬ 
sive increase may also be traced. From an obscure 
retreat, an insignificant hamlet, and a noteless town, 
it has become a city, great, magnificent, and opulent.

To its religious establishments during the supersti¬ 
tious ages, is to be attributed the chief cause of its 
early repute. Pope Alexander III., by a bull issued 
in 1175, directed that all persons within the diocese 
should, once a year, visit the cathedral. An injunc¬ 
tion, no doubt very pious and proper, which would 
be cheerfully obeyed, and the love of gain would soon 
assemble a number of settlers, to furnish the weary 
pilgrims the comforts of accommodation and rest. 
The erection of the University, by adding to its 
fame and respectability, greatly promoted its in¬ 
crease. But it is to trade and commerce that Glas¬ 
gow chiefly owes its grandeur, consequence, and 
wealth. 

The ancient city was situated in the vicinity of 
the cathedral, and the Cross, or centre of the town, 
was where the High-street divides the Rottenrow 
from the Drygate. As population increased, the 
new buildings occupied the slope towards the river, 
when the High-street, Saltmarket, Trongate, Gal- 
lowgate, and Bridgegate were successively planned. 
The houses, in these early times, were built, at first, 
of turf and stone, afterwards with wooden fronts, 
and covered with thatch, forming habitations rude 
and unwholesome. By a secret but progressive im¬ 
provement, however, Glasgow was destined to ex¬ 
hibit to future times, an assemblage of princely 
mansions, splendid public buildings, and streets of 
elegant and commodious buildings. 




Historical summary. 85 

Glasgow, although it had eight gales or ports, was 
not completely surrounded with walls. The Stable- 
green-port was built at the north end of the town, 
between the garden-wall of the castle and the west 
side of the street. At the western extremity of the 
Rottenrow there seems to have been a port, and 
another at the eastern extremity of the Drygate. 
The space between these two, measuring about 1240 
yards, was then reckoned the breadth of the city. 
At the entrance into St. Mungo’s lane stood the 
Gallowgate-port, while that of the Trongate crossed 
the street opposite to the head of the Stockwell. In 
1749, both these were taken down. The water-port 
was placed at the foot of the Stockwell, and a gate 
of beautiful architecture was erected where Bell- 
street terminates in the Candleriggs. 

It cannot be interesting, were it even practicable, 
to trace, in chronological detail, the gradual forma¬ 
tion of the different parts of the city. Previously, 
however, to 1775, the lands on the north of the 
Trongate, named the Ram’s-horn-crofts, * on which 
the greatest part of the New-town is now situated, 
were occupied as gardens. In that year the magis¬ 
trates purchased them, and having drawn up a re¬ 
gular plan cf streets, sold them to builders, who, at 
different times have there erected what, at present, 
is denominated the New-town. 


* On these, Douglas, Earl of Angus, encamped with an army of 12,000 
men, when in open rebellion against John, Duke of Albany, Regent of Scot¬ 
land. 'uring the minority of James V. Hence they were called the Pavilion- 
crofts.

General appearance of the city. 

GLASGOW is built in a style, bold and magni¬ 
ficent. The irregular mode of its architecture, pro¬ 
ducing much diversity of height and structure in 
the houses, relieves the eye, and confers on the 
place a grand and impressive appearance. * The 
following description of it will begin at the toll-bar 
on the Hamilton and Edinburgh road, which termi¬ 
nates in the 

Gallowgate-street, extending in a curved line, 
westward as far as the cross. On each hand, it 
gives off many streets and lanes: those on the left 
lead to the Calton, which is connected, by a chain 
of buildings, to the city. Leaving the barracks on 
the right, you soon arrive at Macfarlane-street, 
terminated by St. John’s Church ; then Campbell- 
street, which contains two meeting-houses belong¬ 
ing to the two sects of Burgher-secgders, and one to 


* The city, with the Barony of Gorbals and suburbs of Calton, Bridgeton, 
Brownfield, Anderston, and Finnieston, stands on upwards of 650 acres of 
ground, and when viewed from the south side of the river exhibits the ap * 
pearanee of a crescent. 


H

that of the Relief. Crossing its head, Gr^eme-street 
runs parallel to the College-gardens. Kent-street, 
on the left, ends in Great Hamilton-street, so 
named in honour of John Hamilton, Esq. of North- 
park, who had been at three different times Lord 
Provost of Glasgow. Near its western extremity 
stands a chapel built by the society of Methodists. 
A section is formed by the conjunction of it with 
Suffolk-street and Hamilton-row. St. Mun- 
go’s-lane, or Burnt-barns, is the next opening, on 
the same side: and, a little beyond it, Charlotte- 
street, * agreeably situated in the vicinity of the 
Green. At the angle of the street is a bridge of one 
arch thrown over the Molendinar-bourn, and form¬ 
ing Nile-street on the right. This rivulet rises 
in the marshes on the north-east of the city, and 
supplies some bleachfields, milns, and a washing- 
house with water. Having passed the Higli-church 
and Duke-street, it enters the College-garden, cros¬ 
ses the Gallowgate and St. Andrew's-street, and is 
emptied into the Clyde. From the English chapel to 
its mouth, it is covered with an almost continued arch. 

Passing St. Andrew’s-lane on his left hand, the 
traveller soon loses the widening Gallowgate in the 
Cross of Glasgow, decorated by a noble equestrian 
statue of William III. It is erected on an ashler 
pedestal, encompassed with an iron rail, and con¬ 
taining this inscription : 


* Before Charlotte-street was formed, near seventy years ago, its site was 
occupied as a kitchen-garden, at the annual rent of 365 merks: hence the 
name of Merk-daily-street, which it still occasionally receives.

right. Passing the junction of George’s-street with 
Duke-street, you begin to ascend the Bell of the 
Brae, which is steep, and lined by houses whose 
rude architecture demonstrates their antiquity. On 
the summit of this ascent was the ancient cross, or 
centre of the old town, formed by the intersection 
of the contiguous streets. From one of these, the 
Rottenrow, * on the left, Taylor f and Weaver- 
streets branch off towards the north, and traverse 
Stirling's-road. Drygate, the name of that on 
the right, before the bridge was built over the Clyde 


* The Rottenrow is 145 feet above the level of the Clyde, being the high¬ 
est part of the city. 

f In January 1795, some workmen dug up, in the ruins of an old house 
in the south end of this street, an earthen pot containing nearly a Scotch 
pint, full of gold coins, of different sizes, and about 900 in number. The 
greatest part of them was Scottish: the remainder English and foreign. 
Among the former were some of James III. and IV., known by the name of 
the Unicorn and its half, with the legend Jacobus Dej Gratia Rex Scoto., and 
on the reverse, Surgat • Deus. Et. Dissipent. In'tmicj. Ej.; also, the Ryder of 
James IV. having his title, and on the reverse, Saluum. Fac. Populum. Tuunu 
Due. —Those of James V. had the legend Jacobus V. Dej. Gra. Rex. Scotorum. 
and on the reverse Crucis Arma Sequamur: Queen Mary’s the legend Maria. 
Dej Gratia Regina Scotorum ; on the reverse, Crucis Arma Sequa?nur, and on 
some, Diligite Justiciam, 1553.—The English consisted mostly of the pieces 
called angels, coined in the 49th year of Henry VI., with the legend on the 
reverse Per Cruc. Tua Salve Nos Xte. Red. One of Henry VIII. had the le¬ 
gend Rutilans Rosa, Sine Spina , and on the reverse Dej Gratia Rex Angl. et 
Fra. Among the Foreign were some French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, 
Imperial, and Popish coins. All the pieces bear dates prior to the time of 
Mary, queen of Scots, and were probably deposited during her troublous 
reign. 



Mint of Robert III.—Bishop’s Castle.—Saltmarket. 89 

by bishop Rae, was the principal street in Glasgow. 
Near its head, on the south, stands the old town¬ 
lodging of the noble family of Montrose, command¬ 
ing an extensive prospect. Almost opposite, is a 
lane called Limmerfield, in which is a house 
wherein was lodged the unhappy Henry Lord 
Darnley, a short time before his untimely death. 
In the same street was the mint of Robert III., and, 
in its vicinity, the manse of the prebend of Cambus- 
lang still remains. Beyond the old cross, on a tri¬ 
angular piece of ground, stood the Bishop’s Castle, 
surrounded by a high wall, and fortified with a bas¬ 
tion at one corner, at another with a tower. Hav¬ 
ing gone to ruin, the property of its site was granted 
by the Crown to the city of Glasgow, for the pur¬ 
pose of erecting the Infirmary which now decorates 
that situation. Immediately to the east stands the 
Cathedral, and in its front without the church-yard 
wall, the new Barony Church. On the left hand, 
several openings have been made, which, when their 
intended buildings are erected, will form neat and 
convenient streets.—Returning to the cross, the tra¬ 
veller may proceed down the 

Saltmarket, which extends tow r ard the Green 
and the Clyde. On his right soon opens Prince’s- 
street, ending in King-street on the west. Oppo¬ 
site, St. Andrew’s-street leads to the cognominal 
square and church. Farther on, the Bridgegate 
stretches to the right, through a groupe of ancient 
buildings which appear to have formerly constituted 
a suburb to the city, and were chiefly occupied by

fishermen. It was then known as the Fisher s’-gate; 
but, since the erection of the bridge, has been dis¬ 
tinguished by its modern name. Facing this street, 
in the Saltmarket, stands a house called Silvercraig’s 
land, which is remarkable as having been the resi¬ 
dence of Oliver Cromwell, during the winter subse¬ 
quent to the battle of Dunbar, September 3d, 1650. 
Passing the overarched Molendinar-bourn, and its 
accompanying road, with the Public Offices and Jail 
on the right, this street ends at the Wooden Bridge. 

The Trongate stretches westward from the Cross, 
and joins Argyle-street. * The projecting spire of 
the Tron Church is the first prominent object which 
meets the view as you advance. On the right, are 
the range of buildings occupying the site of the 
old Jail and the Exchange; then Nelson-street, 
through which neither horses nor carriages are al¬ 
lowed to pass. A little farther on, upon the same 
hand, is Candlerigg-street, terminated by the 
Ram’s-horn Church and its spire. Between the two 
last mentioned streets, stands Donald’s land. No. 
154, in which the illustrious Sir John Moore was 
born. In the Candleriggs, a little beyond Bell-street, 
is the Bazar; and, nearly opposite, Wilson-street, 
ending in Virginia-street on the west. From the 
head of the same street, on the right. Canon-street 


* In 1712, the highest rent of a shop was five pounds, and the lowest 
twelve shillings; the average, a little more than three pounds. In 1818, 
there are some shops let at one hundred and fifty pounds, and from that 
down to one hundred pounds; several at eighty, a great number at sixty, 
fifty, forty, thirty, and twenty pounds, &amp;c.

Albion-streets, which communicate with Bell- 
street on the south, and George’s-street on the north. 
It is lost at the junction of Shuttle-street and the old 
Grammar-school-wynd. Stretching westward from 
the church is Ingram-street, fronted at its termina¬ 
tion by a handsome mansion, having an open court 
and wings, and adorned with Grecian ornaments. 
This splendid structure was built by Mr. Cunningham 
of Lainshaw, and afterwards became the property of 
Mr. John Stirling, who used it as a residence and 
Counting-house. It was purchased in November 
1817, for the sum of &lt;£12,000, by the Governors of 
the Royal Bank of Scotland, who now occupy it as 
the office of business for their branch in this city. At 
the western extremity of Ingram-street. South Fre¬ 
derick and South Hanover-streets go off on the 
right. 

Opposite the Candleriggs is King-street, ending 
in Bridgegate on the south. Advancing farther 
along the Trcngate, you reach Brunswick-place, 
on the right, which, being soon widened, forms 
Brunswick-street, so named in honour of the 
Duke of Brunswick. It intersects Wilson-street, 
and is bounded on the north by Ingram-street. On 
the left are three narrow lanes called Old, New and 
Back wynds: to the right, farther on, is Hutcheson- 
street, * overlooked by the Hospital and its elegant

spite. Glassford-street next opens on the same 
side, and ends in Ingram-street, having the Star Inn 
in front. More than half way up, and opposite the 
Trades’ Hall, is Garthland-street, communica¬ 
ting with Hutclieson-street. On the left. Stock- 
well-street leads to the Old Bridge; and, about 
its middle, has Jackson-street on the right, form¬ 
ing a communication with Dunlop-street. Parallel 
to the river, on the right, is West Clyde-street, 
divided into Charlotte-place and Claremont- 
place, and containing the Roman Catholic Chapel 
and Town-hospital. On the left is East Clyde- 
street, having the Public Offices at its east end, 
and, with the former, making a line, extending from 
the New Bridge to the Green. 

Argyle-street commences where the Trongate 
is intersected by Glassford-street and the Stockwell, 
and prolongs the general line to the village of Ander- 
ston. Beyond the Black Bull Inn, and opening to 
the right, is Virginia-street, next Millar-street, 



intended to form a court; only two sides of which were finished, the south 
and the west. The entrance from the Trongate was by a gate decorated with 
rustier., and raised a few steps above the street. Over this gate was the large 
hall where the children were educated. The building was ornamented with 
a spire a hundred feet high, having a clock and dial. In the north front, 
facing the gardens, (the grounds now occupied by Hutcheson-street were 
then in that situation,) were two niches containing statues of the Founders, 
with this inscription:

then Queen-street, with its Theatre; after which is 
Buchanan-street, receiving Gordon-street from 
the left. Beyond these is Mitchell-street; and, 
in continuation. Nil e-street, crossed by West St. 
Vincent-street, Bath-street, and Sauchiehal 1-road, 
and terminating in the road to Port-Dundas. In 
Bath-street are situated Mr. Harley’s Baths.—The 
next in succession are Union-place and Alston- 
street, which is narrow and incommodious. Re¬ 
turning to the head of the Stock well, and proceeding 
again westward, Dunlop and Maxwell-streets 
successively open on the left, then St. Enoch’s- 
square, with its church, and where is situated the 
Custom-house; and a little farther Jamaica-street, 
giving olf Howard-street on the left, containing 
the Bonding Warehouses, and ending at the New 
Bridge, with the Broomielaw quay on the right. 
The next are Oswald-street, Robertson-street, 
and York-street, on the same hand, extending 
south to the river. 

If the traveller chooses, in his progress, to ad¬ 
vance along Queen-street, it will conduct him to 
George’s-square * on his right, with East and 
West St. Vincent-streets on the opposite hand. 
At the north-west angle of the square are West St. 
George’s-street, and North Queen-street; and, 
at the south-east, Cochran-street, which termin¬ 
ates there. 


* The square being very spacious, the centre of it is reserved for an 
equestrian statue of his present majesty, George III. 







94 George’s-street—Duke-street. 

George’s-street, running due east by the north 
side of the square, stretches along the side of the hill 
in a direction parallel to the Trongate. Proceed¬ 
ing eastward, you pass North Hanover and North 
Frederick-streets, ascending the high ground on 
the left: they are connected by Dempster-street 
on the brow of the ridge. About half way up, Ha- 
milton-street stretches east and west. John and 
Montrose-streets then form successive intersec¬ 
tions. Beyond the Baptist Meeting-house on the 
left, and Albion-street with its chapels on the right, 
is Portland-street, climbing the brae to the Rot- 
tenrow, and receiving Richmond-street from the 
west, about the middle of its course. Alike difficult 
of access is Balmanno-street, on the same side. 
Between it and the High-street is a lane, leading 
up the Deanside-brae to the Rottenrow and Taylor- 
street; and, nearly opposite, is Shuttle-street, 
descending to the south. 

Duke-street now commences in the same line, 
and, passing the Antiburgher Meeting-house and 
Gaelic Chapel on the right, gradually slopes toward 
the Molendinar-bourn, over which is a plain arch. 
Beyond this, and Bridewell on the left, the Drygate 
joins the street from the north. Barrack-street, 
afterwards Sydney-street, Belgrove-place, and 
White vale, are successively found on the right, 
when Duke-street is lost in the Cumbernauld and 
Edinburgh road. 

The city is intersected by two main-streets, cros¬ 
sing each other at right angles. That stretching

from east to west is named at different parts, the 
Gallowgate, Trongate, and Argyle-street, and is 
nearly if mile in length. At King-street it is 83 
feet, and at Queen-street 77 feet in breadth. Most 
of the streets are 60 feet wide; their average breadth 
is 56^ feet. They are all well causewayed with very 
durable whinstones, and skirted with hewn freestone 
pavements, of various breadths. 

Every principal street in the city contains a sewer, 
having communication with the adjacent houses. 
Measured throughout their extent, the sewers occupy 
nearly five miles in length, and are formed of a size 
large enough to admit persons to clean them. Their 
dimensions are, 4 feet 6 inches in height, by 3 feet 
6 inches in breadth, and one brick in thickness, with 
their arch supporting the street. 

Having thus conducted the stranger through the 
principal streets of the city, his attention shall now 
be directed to the spacious scene of amusement and 
exercise. This is emphatically denominated 

THE GREEN, 

and consists of a fine plat of ground, measuring 117 
Scottish, or 133 English acres. It is public property, 
and consists of excellent land, extending south-east 
from the town. The nearest access to it, from the 
Cross, is by the Saltmarket, and by Kent and Char¬ 
lotte-streets from the Gallowgate. Excellent gravel 
walks surround it; and, in some parts, these are over¬ 
shadowed with lofty trees. On the south it is bounded 
by the river, gliding smoothly between its elevated

banks. It is naturally formed into four divisions. 
The original, or Laigh Green, is bounded on the west 
by the Public Offices, and on the east by the acclivity 
commencing at the cross gravel walk near the monu¬ 
ment. From this the High Green , anciently named 
Kinclaith, stretches between the Camlachie-bourn 
x and the river, to the houses and enclosures in the 
vicinity of Rutherglen Bridge. The fine lawns, to 
the eastern extremity, were purchased at different 
times, between 1664 and 1694; the rest in 1776. 
The Colton Green is formed of the old Run-riggs 
of Craignestock, and was obtained between 1686 
and 1699 *’ it is separated from the former by the 
same bourn. On the south-east lies the Fleshers 
hough, in a bend of the river, and divided from the 
High Green by a cut made to carry off the water of 
some mineral springs. The purchase of this field, 
in 1792, from Peter Bell, Esq., for £4000, completed 
the Green to its present extent. 

In the Green, a public Washing-house * is es- 


* This produces a considerable annual revenue to the city. It has been 
let at £600, but since the introduction of water by pipes into the town, the 
yearly rent is much reduced. It was let during 1817 at £495. This sum is 
made up from small annuities, paid by the inhabitants, for the use of the 
house and green, in washing and bleaching their linens. 

“ Here bare-foot beauties lightly trip along; 

Their snowy labours all the verdure throng: 

The linen some, with rosy fingers, rub. 

And the white foam o’erflows the smoking tub: 

Her polished feet another nimbly plies.

House, between which and Nelson’s Monument is 
a fountain of excellent water, denominated, from a 
clump of alders where it issues, the Arns-well. 

During the currency of the last twenty-eight years, 
the Green has been increased nearly one third, and 
various and important improvements made on the 
banks of the Clyde, from Rutherglen to the New 
Bridge. * These operations have cost little short of 
£50, 000, having been executed by estimate, and at 
the sole expense of the Corporation. 

The Green of Glasgow is rendered interesting by 
the busy groupes with which, in fine weather, it is 
thronged. Here may be seen the convalescent soli¬ 
citing health, the idle dissipating time, the contem¬ 
plative courting wisdom, the gay amusing themselves 
and others, and the young participating the pleasures 
of happiness and joy. Here the soldiers of the gar¬ 
rison, and the volunteers, are trained in military 
discipline. Here also games of cricket and golf are

mer, is the resort of youth for bathing and swim¬ 
ming; and in winter, for skating, curling, and other 
appropriate amusements. The surrounding view 
includes many objects of attraction. Hills covered 
to their summits with wood, rise on one side with a 
gentle acclivity, or are cut into dells by the rivulets 
which flow down their sides, while country seats, 
adorned with trees, gardens, and cultivated fields, 
give variety and beauty to the scene. In ari oppo¬

lofty buildings and tapering spires, command atten¬

retreat.

THE GORBALS. 


Description of the Gorbals. 

THIS Barony, once an insignificant village, is 
situated on the south bank of the Clyde, running 
parallel -with Glasgow, nearly a mile. From a few 
mean houses, scattered about the end of the Old 
Bridge, it has become a populous and flourishing 
suburb, emulating the city itself in the elegance of 
its buildings, the public spirit of its inhabitants, and 
the liberality and prudence w T hich characterize its lo¬ 
cal institutions. At present it contains about 20,000 
inhabitants. The origin of the village and etymology 
of its name * are uncertain; but since the building 
of the Old Bridge, it has been indiscriminately dis- 


* Gorbals, ate a topographical appellation, seems to commemorate the 
language of the Strath-Clyde Britons, still preserved among the mountains 
of Wales, whither, in A. r&gt;. 890, a colony of them under Hobart retired 
from the ruins of their country, and obtained a settlement still known by 
the name of Strath-Clwyd. The term is composed of Gor, meaning spa¬ 
cious, extreme, superior , and is of extensive use as a prefix in the structure

tinguished by the appellation of Gorbals, or that of 
Bridge-end. The village and barony were fued from 
Archbishop Porterfield, in 1571, by George Elphin-- 
ston, merchant in Glasgow, who procured them to 
be erected into a burgh of barony and a regality. 
Including its burying-ground, the Gorbals occupies 
about fourteen acres. Having been disjoined from 
that of Go van, on February 21st, 1771, it was erected 
into a separate parish, of which'the heritors are pa¬ 
trons. The lands of Little Govan and Polmadie, 
consisting of about 600 acres, were afterwards, by 
desire of the inhabitants, annexed to the parish of 
Gorbals, by the Presbytery of Glasgow. 

The ancient village was composed of detached 
houses. Lady Campbell of Lochow, in 1350, erec¬ 
ted in it a house for the reception of lepers. On the 
east side of the chief street is an old building, the 
lower part of which is employed as a Council-cham¬ 
ber and Police-office; the upper is a prison. On its 
ceiling and front are the letters S. G. E., supposed 
to be the initials of Sir George Elphinston, whose 
house still remains near the middle of the place. His 
property afterwards came into the possession of Sir 
Robert Douglas of Blackerstone, and, in 1647, was 
purchased by the united funds of the City of Glas- 
* gow, the Trades’ House, and Hutchesons’ Hospital. 
In 1790, this acquisition was divided; when the ju-

The magistrates of Gorbals are annually elected, 
and consist of a senior and two resident baillies. 
The Lord Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council 
of Glasgow, as superiors of the barony, appoint one 
of their number to be chief or senior baillie ; the 
other two are elected by the inhabitants of the old 
village of Gorbals and Tradestown the one year, 
and by those of Hutchesontown and Lauriestown 
the next. To these are added four birleymen, * who

may be continued a second year in office, by the su¬ 
perior, if thought proper. 

By an Act of Parliament, in 1808, a system of 
Police was established in the Gorbals, extending over 
the whole barony, being the old village of Gorbals, 
Hutchesontown, Lauriestown, and Tradestown. This 
is divided into twelve separate wards, over which 
preside as many commissioners; the magistrates be¬ 
ing at the same time commissioners ex officiis. These 
are elected annually, on the second Monday of Au¬ 
gust, by a majority of votes of the inhabitants occu¬ 
pying houses at or above £5 sterling of yearly rent. 
The objects of Police are executed by a Master of 
Police, Clerk, Officers, who are special Constables, 
and Watchmen, who are appointed by the Commis¬ 
sioners ; and the expense of the establishment is de¬ 
frayed by an assessment of not more than sixpence in 
the pound on rents below £4 per annum; eightpence 
under £6; tenpence under &lt;£9 i and one shilling on 
all above that sum. The Act also empowers the 
Commissioners to build a Work-house or Bridewell, 
for the suppression of disorder, immorality, and vice. 

W'hile the inhabitants of Gorbals have been active 
in procuring to themselves public comfort and order, 
they are equally attentive to the promotion of know¬ 
ledge and morality, as the best means of securing 
the happiness of society. With this view, they have 
erected a large public school, on a popular and im¬ 
proved plan, wherein many children are instructed 
in the elements of reading, writing, and accounts.— 
This barony has also a Civil and Criminal court.

HUTCHESONTOWN. 

At the division of the lands of Gorbals, in 1790, 
the level track of ground on the east of the village, 
called St. Ninian’s Croft, became the property of 
Hutchesons’ Hospital, and was feued out by the 
directors of that institution. Hence is derived its 
name. This village was begun in 1794, upon a re¬ 
gular plan, and laid out into a number of right-lined 
streets. Many of these have already been completed, 
with good houses from two to four stories in height. 
It contains a Relief meeting-house, with several great 
public works. 

A short distance ta the east of Hutchesontown, 
fronting the river, is Wellington-place, which 
contains a number of fine buildings, from three to 
four stories in height. 

LAURIESTOWN 

is so called from the name of the gentlemen by whom 
it was feued, in 1802, from the Directors of Hutch¬ 
eson’s Hospital. It occupies the space between the 
Gorbals and New Bridge, comprising about 1000 
feet, and extends 3000 feet southward. Carlton- 
place, the principal street, runs parallel to the river, 
upon a terrace so elevated as to preclude inundation. 
It consists uf two elegant ranges, separated by Port- 
land-street, 80 feet wide; each of them is 360 feet 
in length, and four stories in height, including a half-

sunk one. It contains several other streets 60 feet 
broad, projecting in direct lines from the Tradestown 
streets, and crossing Portland-street and others at 
right angles, which stretch in straight lines from the 
river the whole length of the ground. Eglinton- 
street, 7 5 feet broad, divides it from Tradestown, 
and extends from the New Bridge to the Pollock- 
shaws road: in this street is a neat Methodist Chapel. 
—The whole extent of Lauriestown is fifty acres. 

TRADESTOWN 

is built to the west of Lauriestown, on ground feued, 
in 1790, from the Trades’ House and Incorporations 
of Glasgow. The principal streets extend westward 
from the bridge, and parallel to the river, with courts 
or areas behind. The finest of them faces the Clyde, 
and is thence named Clyde Buildings, having a 
sloping lawn in front. A short distance to the south¬ 
west, on the Paisley road, is Kingstown, which con¬ 
tains many buildings, particularly the range called 
Maxweltown, on the high road from Glasgow to 
Paisley, which adds to their cheerfulness by the fre¬ 
quent passage of travellers. 

GRAHAMSTOWN 

seems rather to be a continuation of Argyle-street, 
than a separate suburb. It is, however, generally 
considered as such, and contains a few streets branch¬ 
ing off towards the north. 







Description of Brownfield and Anderston. 


105 




BROWNFIELD 

was formerly a bleachfieltl belonging to Messrs. 
Brown, Carriek &amp; Co., and consists of about ten 
acres. It was feued in 179L at a ground annual of 
J03OO, and is chiefly occupied by weavers. Many 
of the projected streets are incomplete. 

ANDERSTON 

lies beyond the former, about a mile west from the 
Cress of Glasgow, and on the same side of the Clyde. 
It derived its name from Mr. Anderson of Stobcross, 
who, in 1725, formed the design of erecting it. The 
estate was purchased, in 1735, by John Orr, Esq. 
of Barrowfield, who found the projected village in 
a state of infancy, consisting only of a few thatched 
houses. By a proper encouragement of manufactures, 
however, it has become a large and populous suburb, 
containing many public works, particularly a large 
cotton-mill, the property of Mr. Henry Houldsw orth, 
in which cast iron is substituted for wood, through¬ 
out the building. In the village are several meeting¬ 
houses consecrated to religion. 

On the west of Anderston is Finnieston, laid out 
by the proprietor of Stobcross, in 1770; and, in com¬ 
pliment to the Rev. Mr. Finnie, who projected it, it 
received his name. It contains the reservoir of the 
Cranston-hill Water-work Company, and the Ver- 
reville Crystal Manufactory, the property of John 
Geddes, Esq. of that place.

Description of Willow-Bank—Baths and Cow-houses. 


WILLOW-BANK 

is situated to the north-west of the city, and though 
in 1810, the period of its formation by Mr. Harley, 
it was at a considerable distance, yet, in consequence 
of the great increase of buildings in that direction, 
it is now nearly connected with the city. The baths 
here are elegant and commodious, and are let to the 
public at various rates, from 3 s. to 1 s. each. Attached 
to the premises is a saloon, supplied with a variety 
of newspapers. Here are also two bowling-greens, 
conveniently adapted to the amusement of those who 
resort to this fashionable place of recreation. 

In the same year, Mr. Harley first began to turn 
his attention to the formation of a dairy, on a large 
scale. Since that period, he has built several cow¬ 
houses. The last erected, and which he conceives 
to be on the best construction, contains one hundred 
cows; being placed on a steep inclined plane, it 
stands on arches forming vaults, in which carts are 
placed to receive the dung from the groops. The 
building is ninety-four feet long by sixty-three feet 
wide within the walls; is eight feet high, and co¬ 
vered with three roofs which have no horizontal 
ceilings; the slates are pinned to rafters, and lime- 
pointed; the entire of the floor is laid with hewn 
freestone, forming five longitudinal passages, each 
five feet wide, commencing at the side avails, and 
one transverse passage nine feet wide, near the cen¬ 
tre of the building; there being twelve cows in four 
rows on one side of it, and thirteen in four rows on

107 


the other side. The space between the longitudinal 
passages, for the immediate use of the cows, is nine 
feet six inches, of which one foot six inches is for 
the groop, and two feet for the grass or hay trough. 
A balcony has been erected and laid-to on the out¬ 
side of the building, for exhibiting the cows. Since 
its commencement, the dairy has often varied in 
extent. It began with twenty cows, and increased to 
two hundred and sixty. At present, there are about 
one hundred and sixty cows in the establishment.— 
A washing-green and public walks are also attached, 
and little necessary for the wants of a large city is 
here wanting. The whole, indeed, exhibits a scale 
of unparalleled individual enterprise, and is abun¬ 
dantly worthy of the patronage of this munificent 
city. 

To the west of this establishment, the same gen¬ 
tleman has erected a range of buildings, combining 
a degree of elegance with the retirement of the 
country. Each house is occupied by one family, 
and the whole is laid off in a regular and uniform 
manner, divided into the following compartments: 
viz. Wellington-place, Windsor-place, and Ken- 
sington-place. On the right side of the road are 
several fine houses, embellished with gardens in the 
front.

CALTON. 

At the commencement of the last century, this 
place was called Blackfauld, from the ground, on 
the east of Glasgow, upon which it was built, hav¬ 
ing been formerly occupied as a fold for black cattle. 
This property was purchased in 1705, from the com¬ 
munity of Glasgow, by Walkinshaw of Barrowfield, 
who first projected the village. It was chiefly com¬ 
pleted, however, by John Orr, Esq., who acquired 
the Barrowfield estate. It contains many good 
streets, and is occupied by a population of nearly 
20,000 souls, the greatest part of which consists of 
weavers, and the people employed in the cotton- 
mills erected in the village and its vicinity. Includ¬ 
ing all that part of the estate of Barrowfield known 
by the name of Old and New Calton, this village 
was erected, in August 1817, by a charter from the 
crown, into a Burgh of Barony, to be governed by 
a Provost, three Baillies, a Treasurer, and eleven 
Counsellors, to be annually elected, forming a Birley 
Court, with powers similar to that of the Dean of 
Guild in royal burghs. At the same time a weekly 
market was instituted.—List of the first Magistrates:

is nearly half a mile in length, and stretches, in a 
south-east direction, between the Calton and the 
Clyde. It is so named from its vicinity to the 
bridge, thrown over the river in 1777, leading to 
the ancient burgh of Rutherglen. The inhabitants 
are chiefly weavers and cotton-spinners. 


CAMLACHIE * *

is situated two miles eastward of Glasgow, on the 
Edinburgh and Hamilton road, and is mostly inha¬ 
bited by coaliers, employed in the numerous mines 
in its neighbourhood. From these is derived a great 
part of the fuel for the city, and also a considerable 
quantity for exportation. Upwards of 250,000 wag¬ 
gon-loads of coal, 24 cwt. each, which at 14s. amount 
to £175,000, pass through the Gallowgate toll dur¬ 
ing the year.

from the cross of Glasgow, on the south bank of the 
Clyde. Its name * is given to the parish, five miles 
long and nearly four wide, of which the Faculty of 
the University of Glasgow exercises the patronage. 
The village, arranged on both sides of the Greenock 
road, contains about 300 families; the parish, nearly 
12,000 inhabitants, employed chiefly by manufactu¬ 
rers and farmers.—On the opposite bank of the river 
is Partick, and the ruins of the ancient retreat of 
the episcopal dignitaries of Glasgow. 


* Strath-Clyde was inhabited by people, whose language long retained 
much affinity to the Cymro-Celtic of the south. Its topography, in conse¬ 
quence, exhibits many names of places and natural objects whose roots are 
deducible from terms in that expressive tongue. Synonymes, however, are 
occasionally found in the kindred speech of the Gael of Albin, though less 
frequent in local appellations on the southern shores of the Clyde than in 
other districts.— Gov, Govan, Govant, in the Cymro-Celtic, are all used to 
designate an artist, a smith, a smith who prepared, his metal from the ore. Go- 
bha, bh sounds v, in the Gaelo-Celtic, also signifies a smith. —Govan having 
been, for ages, dependent on the hierarchy of St. Mungo, suggests a conjec¬ 
ture that the work-shops of the episcopal artisans may perhaps have given 
origin to this village, the ancient Smithfield of Glasgow. Men, in our times, 
may not readily perceive the advantages of such a site, but it would be hasty 
to condemn arrangements from the imperfect evidence of their propriety 
now to be obtained.—Local circumstances seem to have conferred on Partick, 
anciently Perdyc, the designation by which it continues to be known. Per , 
in Cymro-Celtic, means sweet fruit of all kinds ; Teq, t changes to d in com¬ 
position, expresses what is clear, fair, fine, beautiful. Perdeq may thus signify 
the Place of fair Fruit-trees} it was probably the site of the bishop’s orchard.

Summary of the religion of the Druids. 

THE religion of every country affects the charac¬ 
ter of its votaries, and operates powerfully upon 
their manners. That of the Strath-Clyde Britons 
was the same with the faith of all the aborigines of 
the Celtic stem. Their priests were Druids, and 
one omnipotent being the sole object of their ado¬ 
ration. The solemnity of every system of faith has 
ever been promoted by certain ceremonies attached 
to the exhibition of its peculiar rites. The Druidic 
creed inculcated a pure devotion and a patriotic 
morality, impressed by a firm belief in the immor¬ 
tality of the human soul. 

The sublime doctrines of the Druids were deli¬ 
vered in appropriate retreats, and accompanied by 
a ritual equally simple and significant. They con¬ 
ducted their worship, they pronounced their lessons, 
and they administered their laws, amid the tribes

and in the face of the noon-day sun. In their pre¬ 
sence and by their approbation, virtue was honoured, 
and vice degraded or punished: and, what ignorance 
has branded upon them as the infernal practice of 
Human Sacrifice, was the public and salutary exe¬ 
cution of law upon wretches, who had forfeited their 
lives to society by their enormities and crimes. 

When the heavenly principles of Christianity, 
beaming with philanthropy and love, were offered to 
their acceptance, the Druids were prepared by the 
purity of their former faith to discern their celestial 
origin, and to perceive their mighty influence in ex¬ 
panding the mind, purifying the affections, and im¬ 
proving the condition of man. Instructed by the 
Culdees, and enlightened by the rays of Divine 
Truth, many of them united in the promulgation 
of those precepts which truly guide mankind in the 
discharge of their duties, and direct them to the 
only source of well-being and bliss. 

Ninian, the venerable bishop of Whithorn in 
Galloway, before the end of the fifth century, had 
instructed the people of Strath-Clyde in the Chris¬ 
tian faith. In a. d. 554, and while the Religion of 
Peace was but in its infancy among these regions, 
Cathal bishop of Ald-Cluyd died. About the same 
time, Kentigern the Culdee arose in Strath-Clyde; 
and, notwithstanding the opposition of Merrdyn and 
the unconverted Druids, widely disseminated the 
doctrines of the Gospel over his native country. 
Having at last fixed his residence at Glasgow, this 
illustrious presbyter planted a church, and, in a. d.

seminary continued eminent, for ages, as a seat of 
usefulness and piety, distinguished by the splendour 
of its establishment and the influence of its power. 

Baldred his disciple succeeded to the seat of Ken¬ 
tigern; but from the date of his accession to the 
refoundation of the See by David I. in the begin¬ 
ning of the twelfth century, a period of more than 
five hundred years, no circumstance is commemorated 
whereby even the existence of Glasgow as a town 
can be ascertained. John Achaius, in 1129 , begins 
the series of thirty catholic prelates, which termi¬ 
nates in 1560, when archbishop James Beatoun re¬ 
tired into France with the spoils of the diocese and 
of the university. Protestant episcopacy being now 
established, a succession of fourteen archbishops 
ruled the See of Glasgow till 1688, when presbyte- 
rianism became the national religion.

facturing town of Paisley; the castles of Mearns and 
Cruikstone, noted for the residence of the unfortu¬ 
nate Mary Stewart, and the ancient fortress of Dun¬ 
barton, perched upon its rock, stand in full view; 
while the hills of Renfrewshire, and the snow-capt 
mountains of Argyle, imbound the remote prospect. 
To the north, the Campsie-hills at the distance of 
ten miles, and in the opposite direction, those of 
Cathkin, distant five, close the diversified landscape. 
Immediately on the east of the Cathedral is a deep 
ravine in which flows the Molendinar-bourn; on 
the west stands the Infirmary, an elegant modern 
structure, forming a striking contrast to the rude 
majesty of the ancient pile. 

The Cathedral is built in the form of a cross, 
whose greatest length is from east to west, and the 
transepts from north to south. From the middle of 
the building ascends the great tower, which, for 30 
feet above the roof, is of a square form, and termi¬ 
nates in a battlement. Within this rises a lofty 
octangular spire ornamented with two smaller bat¬ 
tlements, at equal distances from each other and the 
top. The octagon between these is decorated by 
windows in the pointed style, and by four small 
pyramidal spires, which issue from within the first 
battlement at its bottom. Another square tower is 
raised upon the west end of the church, till on a 
level with the battlement of the great steeple. It 
is then covered by a pyramidal leaden roof, adorned 
with a vane, and contains the clock and bell, 12 feet 
1 inch in circumference. In the winter of 1789,

The Cathedral is externally divided on both sides 
into compartments, by buttresses of equal dimen¬ 
sions, between which are placed windows in the 
pointed style, all somewhat similarly ornamented. 
This succession of windows is interrupted by the 
transepts, directly under the great tower in the cen¬ 
tre of the church. The north and south windows 
in the transepts are 40 by 22 feet, divided with 
mullions and tracery. Above the first range of 
windows the wall terminates in a battlement, within 
which springs the lowest roof, till it meets the se¬ 
cond or inner wall, which rises from thence for a

number of feet. This, in like manner, is divided 
into compartments by small square projections, be¬ 
tween each of which are placed three narrow win¬ 
dows in the pointed style, directly above each of 
those in the first story. It then terminates in the 
same manner as the lower wall, and is caped with a 
leaden roof. 

The Vestry was in the north transept of the Ca¬ 
thedral, and had a communication with the nave by 
a vaulted entry. It is now occupied as a private 
burying-place. The south was never completed, 
and is at present used as a dormitory for the de¬ 
ceased clergy of the city, and their families. The 
architecture is finer than that of the rest of the 
building, and is supposed to be of no older date 
than the year 1500. Its arched roof is supported 
by columns adjoining the outer walls. There is al¬ 
so a row of pillars in the centre, and the capitals of 
the whole are decorated with figures and flowers. 
The area of its top long formed an ornamental gar¬ 
den, but in 1812 received a stone pavement, con¬ 
cealed by a parapet. 

The Consistory, in which the bishops held their 
ecclesiastical courts, is 25 feet long, 23 wide, and 
projects from the south-west corner of the Cathedral. 
It is now used by the commissary of the district as 
a court-room, having seats and a bench, over which 
the royal arms with C. R. II. are placed. Above it 
is a repository of documents belonging to the com¬ 
missary-court. Between this and the tower was the

ancient entrance, by a magnificent door, which is 
now shut up. 

The Chancel, whose groined roof rests on massy 
pillars, is separated on the east from the nave. Un¬ 
derneath it were the bishops’ cemetery and a repo¬ 
sitory of monkish relics, now converted into a place 
of interment for the heritors of the Barony-parish. 
In it is still shown, the monument of Kentigern, 
together with the reservoir in which the holy water 
was kept. On the north end of the Chancel was 
the Chapter-house, forming a cube of 28 feet, with 
groined ceiling sustained by a pillar 20 feet high. 
Since the Reformation, it has been employed as a 
session-house and vestry. 

The whole building, to which the usual entries 
are on the south, is arranged into four divisions, the 
Choir, Outer Church, Inner High Church, and 
Vaulted Cemetery. * It is lighted by 157 windows, 
is supported by 147 pillars, and measures 1090 feet 
round the walls. Its interior length is 319 feet, the

ministers from meddling any more in the business, saying, ‘ That too many 
churches had been already destroyed, and that he would not tolerate more 
abuses of that kind.’ ” Spottirwoode's Hist. p. 304.

breadth 63. The great steeple measures 225 feet 
from the floor of the Choir, and terminates in a ball 
and weathercock. It is 105 feet above the level of 
the Clyde at the Old Bridge. The Cathedral is sur¬ 
rounded by two ample grave-yards, wherein more 
than seven hundred corpses are annually interred. 

THE CHOIR. 

This is the first division of the Cathedral to which 
the stranger is admitted. It is 744 feet long, 63 
wide, 90 high, and has an appearance grand and 
impressive. Majestic columns, decorated with mo¬ 
numental tablets of marble and other memorials of 
the dead, divide the space and sustain the roof. 
These are 75 feet in height and 30 in circumference. 
The four, on the right, support the steeple, and be¬ 
tween the two, on each side, are opposite windows, 
40 feet high, by 22 wide. That on the south is 
divided longitudinally by four mullions, two tiers 
of them in the flight, forming 12 parallel windows, 
or days, with the upper part of the pointed arch 
filled in with tracery. That on the north has five 
mullions, which run from top to bottom without 
being divided into flights. On the left, is a door 
leading into the Outer Church; and, on the right, 
two flights of stairs conduct to the Vaulted Ceme¬ 
tery. Above these, is an elegant niche for the re¬ 
ception of an organ, which was designed by Mr. D. 
Hamilton, architect, at the expense of the Sacred 
Music Society. The inferior part of this is orna¬ 
mented by ancient sculpture, representing the twelve

apostles. From the floor of the Choir, a stair on the 
right leads to the nave. 

THE OUTER CHURCH 

is the western division of the cathedral. Tt was 
anciently a part of the Choir, from which it is now 
separated by a stone wall. Two rows of clustered 
columns run through its length, from east to west, 
parallel to the walls from which they are several 
feet distant. These pillars are connected with each 
other by pointed arches, which spring from the capi¬ 
tals, and unite at the top by a common centre. On 
these arches are built the inner walls which contract 
the breadth of the building in the upper part. Be¬ 
tween the pillars are placed, through the whole range, 
pointed windows, which give light to the ground-area 
of the church. Another tier of smaller windows, 
placed along the upper wall, lightens the vacant 
space. This church, which contains 1362 seats, un¬ 
derwent a complete repair in 1811, and was then 
fitted up in the modern style. The great western 
window, 44 feet 6 inches high, and 23 feet 6 inches 
wide, and interfilled with munnions and head-work, 
was re-opened at an expense of &lt;£500, in the subse¬ 
quent year. It throws an air of cheerfulness and 
dignity over the interior of the place. 

THE INNER HIGH CHURCH. 

In this, as in the Choir, two ranges of columns run 
parallel to the walls, and support, by a double tier 
of arches, the upper row of windows. The pillars.

consequently, are not so lofty, but are of finer 
workmanship, and have their capitals richly sculp¬ 
tured. From these spring the arches, which, with 
those rising from the corresponding columns on the 
walls, intersect each other at the key-stone, which 
is finely carved. A gallery is thus formed, along 
the church, with an arched roof, through which, 
from the windows, the hotly of the church is light¬ 
ed. Above this is another range of columns, sup¬ 
porting the highest tier of windows, from which the 
upper part of the building derives light. From 
the top of the inner walls, immediately above these 
windows, springs a lofty arched roof, finely orna¬ 
mented. In the eastern gable, is a great window 
divided by mullions; and immediately below it, re¬ 
ceding from the body of the church, is the space 
formerly occupied by the altar. The roof is sup¬ 
ported by five pillars, over which was a terrace- 
walk. On the north side of the altar is the vestry, 
the roof arched and supported by one pillar, 19 feet 
high, in the centre, where arched pillars from every 
angle terminate. 

This church, like the other, w r as completely re¬ 
fitted about seven years ago, from designs by Mr. 
Stark, architect, and contains ll6'5 seats. The great 
arch, formerly built up, between this and the Choir, 
has been partly opened and glazed; the remainder 
is filled up with another arch, which encloses the 
space for an organ, facing the Choir. It is deco¬ 
rated with appropriate ornaments. New galleries 
have also been constructed, the fronts of which are

tastefully ornamented. The pulpit is placed nearly 
in the east end, and in the middle of the opposite 
gallery is the King’s-sea$, adorned with the Royal 
Arms and other emblematic devices. The area at 
the back of the pulpit has again been brought into 
view, by the removal of the partition which filled 
the arches. These are now filled with tracery and 
stained glass, as is likewise the great superior win¬ 
dow. By these improvements, the area of the 
church appears considerably enlarged from the pros¬ 
pect obtained of the roof of the Choir and the altar- 
place ; and the effect of the whole is thereby rendered 
much more grand, striking, and beautiful. 

THE VAULTED CEMETERY 

is situated immediately beneath the Inner Church, 
and was first opened as a place of worship for the 
Barony parish, in 1575 ; but, in 1801, was again con¬ 
verted into a burying-place. Its roof of groined arches 
is supported by 65 clustered pillars, some of which 
are 18 feet in circumference, and running parallel 
to the walls. They are strong and massive; and, 
by their position and the smallness of the windows 
the interior is rendered dark and gloomy. Beneath 
repose the ashes of the dead, and the pillars are hung 
with shreds of escutcheons. The combinations in this 
place of graves are impressive and solemn, and calcu¬ 
lated to awaken in the soul the most serious emotions,

is situated in the centre of a cemetery, retired about 
80 yards from the High-street, a little below the 
College, and on the same side. It is a plain build¬ 
ing, erected in 1 699 * upon the site of a more ancient 
pile, called Blackfriars, which, in 1666, was de¬ 
stroyed by a storm of thunder and lightning. In 
front of the building is a small steeple containing a 
bell. The church will accommodate 1218 sitters.— 
When the foundations of the old church were dug 
yp, a number of cells were discovered, whose use 
conjecture has referred to the purposes of religious 
seclusion. 


TRON, OR LAIGH CHURCH 

stands a little west from the Cross, on the south 
side of the Trongate, and behind the houses which 
immediately front the street. The entry to it is 
under a wide arch. A church was founded in this 
place in 1484, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary; 
but, having fallen into ruin, was repaired in 1592, 
and continued in use till the 8th of February, 1793, 
when it was destroyed by fire. Next year, the pre¬ 
sent structure was erected, at an expense of £2700. 
It is a plain building, designed by Mr. James Adam, 
and surmounted by a cupola, which illuminates the

house, divided into 1277 seats. A spire, built in 
1637, and 126 feet in height, stands between it and 
the street. It has a clock and two bells, and ter¬ 
minates in a battlement, with windows in the pointed 
arch style. The ground-flat is occupied as a shop. 
The name Tron * was applied to this church from 
part of its steeple having been used as a place for 
weighing butter, cheese, and similar commodities. 

NORTH-WEST, OR RAM’S-HORN CHURCH 

was erected at the north extremity of Candlerigg- 
street in 1720; but its appearance indicates a much 
older date. It is built in the form of a parallelo¬ 
gram, lying east and west, having a transverse aisle, 
extending towards the north. It affords 1183 siU 
tings. A square steeple, 140 feet in height, with a 
clock, adorns its front. Behind it is a burying-ground. 

ST. ANDREW’S CHURCH 

stands in the cognominal square. It w r as founded 
in 1739, but not completed till 1756, at an expense 
of nearly &lt;£15,000. The building is a complete spe¬ 
cimen of the Composite order, and resembles that of 


* The Trone is an instrument, consisting of two horizontal bars crossing 
each other, beaked at the extremities, and supported by a wooden pillar, 
used for weighing heavy wares. This instrument still remains in some 
towns.

St. Martin’s in the Fields, London, with some alter¬ 
ations, especially in the steeple. It was constructed 
by Mungo Nasmith, an eminent mason, and con¬ 
tains 910 seats. The front, towards the west, has 
a pediment, in the tympany of which is a bas-relief 
of the City Arms, and forms an elegant portico of 
six columns of the Composite order, to which the 
ascent is by a magnificent flight of steps. Around 
the building, the same order is continued in the 
form of pilasters, between each of which are placed 
arched windows, and the whole is crowned with a 
balustrade and vases. The interior of the church is 
very elegantly finished. A double row of Corinthian 
columns extends throughout its length, and parallel 
to the walls, from which they are several feet dis¬ 
tant. A kind of open gallery is thus formed on each 
side. These columns have corresponding pilasters 
in the walls, with which, above the capitals, they 
join, by a groined roof ornamented with emblematic 
devices in stucco, done by Mr. Clayton. The pulpit 
and front of the galleries are of panneled mahogany. 
The steeple, which contains a clock, is heavy and 
ill-proportioned, and surmounted by an ungraceful 
dome terminating in a vane. 

ST. ENOCH’S CHURCH 

was erected in 1780, from designs by Mr. J. Jaffrey, 
on the south side of the square of the same name, on 
the site of an old chapel. Its form is oblong, having 
cut vases placed at each corner. The front, in which 
is the spire, adorned in successive stories with pilas-

ters of tlie different orders, and regularly tapering 
till it terminates in a cone and vane, is decorated 
with a Doric portico. This church is well lighted, 
and finished for the reception of 822 hearers. 

BARONY CHURCH 

is situated in front of the Cathedral, and was built in 
1798, from a design by Mr. Adam, in a mixed style 
of architecture, similar to that employed during the 
ibth century. It is constructed with rubble work. 
The outline of the west front has an imposing effect. 
The interior is well planned, and divided into 1248 
seats, belonging to the different heritors. 

ST. GEORGE’S CHURCH 

is situated on the west side of Buchanan-street, 
fronting George’s-street. It extends in front 65, in 
depth 97 feet. The principal front is of Doric three 
quarter columns with back pilasters the whole height 
of the church, with entablature and balustrade; above 
which, upon the front, commences the steeple, with 
bastions at the angles. In the first story the bastions 
are clustered pilasters, and the second finishes as an 
octagon tower, terminating with pedestals and obe¬ 
lisks. Within these, and leaving them insulated, 
commences the clock-story, which is octagonal, and 
supports a circular die-wall and columns, forming a 
kind of temple, crowned with a dome and obelisk. 
The mouldings and minutiae of the steeple are Ro¬ 
man architecture, but the general form is what has 
been improperly denominated Gothic, and has a very

curious and picturesque effect. Its height is 162 feet 
6 inches. The interior of the church is very neat, 
and arranged for the accommodation of 1195 hearers. 
This church was finished at an expense of ,£9000, 
after designs by Mr. William Stark, architect. In 
the foundation-stone was deposited a plate contain¬ 
ing the following inscription:

Episcopal and Catholic Chapels. 


EPISCOPAL CHAPEL. 

This chapel is situated to the north of the Public 
Green, on the east side of the lane leading from St. 
Andrew’s-square. It was erected by subscription in 
1750, and is a neat oblong building; but, by its low 
situation is, when the river overflows its banks, in¬ 
undated. It contains an elegant well-toned organ, 
and an orchestra, situated at the east end, above the 
altar. The fronts of the galleries are finely panneled 
and covered with green cloth: the eastern window is 
ornamented with scriptural devices. At a little dis¬ 
tance, in front of the altar, and looking towards the 
west, is placed a mahogany pulpit, adorned with a 
canopy and mitre, and supported by a pillar of the 
Composite order. The minister and clerk’s pulpits 
are covered with crimson velvet. In winter this 
chapel is heated by stoves. A burying-ground sur¬ 
rounds it. 

CATHOLIC CHAPEL. 

Intolerance no longer reigns vested with the dig¬ 
nity of princely power, nor accompanied by the 
rigid austerities of reforming zeal. Conscience is 
now the lawgiver who enacts the mode of -worship 
which the creature shall pay to the Creator. Under 
this mild and proper arrangement, the religion of 
Rome has been increasing the number of her votaries 
in this northern part of our island; and, in the City 
of Glasgow, within these few years, the number of 
Roman Catholics has considerably augmented. In

1815, they erected a chapel, elegant in structure, 
ample in accommodation, and highly ornamental to 
the city. Placed in an open and favourable situation 
for displaying its magnificence, it cannot fail to arrest 
the attention and attract the curiosity of all strangers. 

The chapel is built in the pointed Gothic style, 
and consists of a nave and side aisles. The outside 
walls are supported by large massive buttresses with 
embrasures, and two larger double ones at each angle 
rising higher into a crocheted pinnacle. The nave 
wall and the buttresses are panneled, pinnacled, and 
ornamented with crockets. The side windows are 
simple and elegant, of which there are six on each 
side, with mullions and deep labels over the tops, 
sixteen feet in height, and eight feet in breadth. 
The south, or principal front, consists of two large 
octagonal towers, projecting some feet from the 
side aisles, with buttressed and pointed arched pan- 
nels in four divisions; the top of each tower being 
embrasured, and eight ornamental pinnacles rising 
above to the height of ten feet. In the centre, be¬ 
tween the towers, is the grand entrance, by a richly 
ornamented door, nineteen feet high, with deep 
Gothic mouldings, and five semi-pillars receding, 
ornamented at the capitals with foliage, and finished 
on the top with a label and double leafed crockets. 
Above the door is a large pointed window, of very 
rich mullions and tracery, designed with great taste; 
the whole ending above with a Gothic balustrade 
and niche, with buttresses and pinnacles, containing 
a colossal statue of St. Andrew. On each side of the 






Dimensions of the Catholic Chapel. 





towers are the elegant pointed windows of the side 
aisles. The whole front exhibits a beautiful harmony 
of design. 

The north end is an octagonal projection, with a 
large pointed window in the centre. The recess 
formed in the inside, contains the altar-piece. The 
centre window is to be enriched with painted glass, 
by Mr. Eginton of Birmingham: the subject is the 
ascension of our Saviour; and, on the two sides, 
upon the smaller windows, the figures of the apostles 
St. Peter and St. Paul. 

The arrangement of the interior corresponds with 
the exterior beauty of the chapel. A row of elegant 
pillars runs on each side the whole length of the 
church, and supports with pointed arches the nave 
and the roof; the capitals of the pillars richly fo- 
liaged. The roof Gothic pannel work, ornamented 
with lies of leaves and other figures. 

The chapel is situated in West Clyde-street, and 
is calculated to contain 2300 persons in the pews. 
An elegant organ is placed at the south end, which 
cost 600 guineas. The tones of this instrument, deep 
and full, harmonize with the impressive appearance 
of the interior of this splendid place of worship. The 
dimensions of the chapel are as follow: length 109 
feet, breadth 84 feet; height, including the roof, 6l 
feet; height of the towers to the top of the pinnacles, 
83 feet. The foundation-stone was laid on the 23d 
June, 1814; and divine service was performed for 
the first time in the chapel, on Sunday, 22d De¬ 
cember, 18Id. The plan was furnished by Mr.

Gillespie, an eminent architect of Edinburgh ; and 
the work was executed by Mr. Thomas Smith, mason, 
of Glasgow. The whole building and ground cost 
upwards of £13,000; the greater part of which is 
said to have been raised by small weekly contribu¬ 
tions, from persons of the Roman Catholic persua¬ 
sion, in the city and neighbourhood.

THE churches already described, with the excep¬ 
tion of the Episcopal and Catholic Chapels, are all 
that belong to the Establishment. There are some 
Chapels of Ease, and three places of worship where 
divine service is performed partly in English and 
partly in Gaelic. The College Chapel is appropria¬ 
ted to the use of the Professors, their families, and 
the students attending the University. Another, 
situated in Canon-street, formerly belonged to the 
synod of the Relief, but was restored, in 1774, to 
the communion of the church. A third has been 
erected in Tobago-street, Calton; a fourth at Shet- 
tleston, in the Barony parish, and a fifth in Clyde- 
street, Anderston. One of the Gaelic Chapels is

in Duke-street. 

The members of the Scottish Episcopal Church 
attend divine worship in an apartment of the old 
Grammar-school. 

The Burgher Seceders have three places of wor¬ 
ship in town. Of these the oldest is built in Shuttle- 
street, the next on the east side of Campbell-street, 
and the last erected, on the opposite side of the same 
street. 

The Antiburghers have an elegant meeting¬ 
house in Duke-street, and another in Cheapside- 
street, Anderston. 

The people in communion with the synod of Re¬ 
lief are divided into seven congregations. One of 
these meets in the Great Dovehill, another in Camp¬ 
bell-street, one in John-street, a fourth in Kirk-street, 
Anderston, a fifth in Broad-street, Hutcheson town, a 
sixth in John-street, Bridgetown, and a seventh at 
Toleross. 

The Independents have a handsome chapel, 
named the Temple, in North Albion-street, one in 
Gorbals, and another, denominated the Tabernacle, 
in Nile-street, towards the west end of the town.—&gt; 
The Unitarian Chapel is in Union-place. 

Those who style themselves Tiie Covenanted 
Presbytery, have a house for divine service in 
Kirk-street, Calton. The Methodist meeting-houses 
are in John-street, Eglinton-street, Great Hamilton- 
street, and East Clyde-street. That of the Anabap¬ 
tists in Georg e’s-street.—Besides these, there are

several places where other sectaries perform their 
peculiar modes of worship. Of these, the chief are 
Quakers, Baptists, and Glassites. 

There were many religious houses in different 
parts of the city which, having fallen into decay, are 
disused, or entirely removed. It will be sufficient to 
mention their names. The monastery of Blackfriars 
was founded in 1220, and stood on the east side of 
the High-street, a little below the College Church. 
The convent of Grayfriars was situated at the foot 
of the lane named from it, now called Bun’s Wynd. 
St. John the Baptist’s Chapel was erected at the head 
of the Drygate, and that of St. Roque, towards the 
head of Castle-street. The Dovehill contained the 
chapel of St. Mungo, while that of his supposititious 
mother, St. Thanew or Thametis, daughter of the 
fabulous Loth, king of the Piets, stood in the High- 
street, a little above the Trongate. The chapel of 
St. Ninian was founded in 1350, in the Gorbals, by 
Lady Lochow, daughter of Robert Duke of Albany, 
and grandmother to John, first Earl of Argyle. 

The city of Glasgow is divided into nine parishes, 
to seven of which the Lord Provost and Magistrates 
are patrons. The other two, being the Inner High 
Church and Barony, are under the patronage of the 
Crown. 

The Presbytery of Glasgow consists of the clergy 
of the City and Barony, of the parishes of Gorbals, 
Rutherglen, Cumbernauld, Carmunnock, Campsie, 
Calder, Govan, Kirkintilloch, Kilsyth, Cathcart, and 
Eaglesham.

HISTORY. 


Opening of the University in 1451. 

THIS University * was originally instituted by a 
bull from Pope Nicholas V. at the request of James 
II.; when William Turnbull, bishop of Glasgow, 
and his successors in that see, were appointed patrons 
of the University. The bull is dated at Rome, 7th 
January, 1450. The University was opened in the 
following year; and to give celebrity to the event, 
the bishop published a bull, which he obtained from 
the pope, granting a universal indulgence to all 
good Christians who should visit Glasgow in 1451. 
David Cadzow was the first rector. 


* In 1412, the University of St. Andrew’s was founded by Bishop Ward- 
law: the University of Glasgow was founded by Bishop Turnbull, in 1450: 
St. Salvador’s College was erected by Bishop Kennedy, in 1458: the Uni¬ 
versity of Aberdeen was established by Bishop Elphinston, in 1500: St. 
Leonard’s College by Prior Hepburn, in 1512: St. Mary’s College by Arch¬ 
bishop Hamilton, in 1552: and the University of Edinburgh was erected by 
charter granted by James VI. in 1582; and was opened, in 1585, for the 
reception of students. 






Charter granted by James II. in favour of the University. 


139 


James II., in 1453, granted a charter in favour of 
the University, declaring that the whole members 
of the University, whether masters or students, if 
not prelates, should be exempted from every sort of 
national tax or public burden; and this privilege was 
repeatedly confirmed by statute. Bishop Turnbull, 
also, who appears to have been the real founder of 
the University, ordained that all the beneficed clergy 
of his diocese, who should become teachers or stu¬ 
dents in the University, should be exempted, during 
their attendance, from residence at their different 
cures, providing they took care to have the religious 
offices performed by vicars. This bishop also, and 
his successors, conferred upon the members of the 
University many remarkable privileges, such as the 
power of buying and selling provisions without toll 
or custom within the bishop’s jurisdiction. The 
magistrates of Glasgow were required to swear that 
they would observe the whole immunities and sta¬ 
tutes of the college. The most complete civil and 
criminal jurisdiction was conferred upon the Rector 
of the University; and whatever houses were pos¬ 
sessed by its members, the rents of them were or¬ 
dained to be fixed by a jury, consisting, the one half 
of members of the University, and the other half of 
citizens. 

It is singular, that when this University was insti¬ 
tuted, no funds appear to have been set apart for its 
support, nor any salaries granted to those employed 
in the laborious business of teaching; neither was 
any sufficient authority constituted for rectifying

disorders that might occur in the University. The 
consequence was, that when the Roman Catholic 
hierarchy was overwhelmed at the Reformation, and 
its property seized by the crown or the nobles, this 
University almost ceased to exist. Gradually, how¬ 
ever, the crown and individuals granted to it various 
donations, particularly of tithes and church property; 
and James VI. during the regency of Morton, in 1577, 
conferred on it the rectory and vicarage of the parish 
of Govan, and a new charter of foundation, regulating 
its constitution, and confirming its prior privileges. 
Charles I. granted to the college, in 1641, the tem¬ 
porality of the bishopric of Galloway. After the 
revolution, in 1693, the sum of T300 per annum was 
granted to each of the Scottish Universities out of 
the property of the abolished bishoprics in Scotland; 
and the college of Glasgow, to secure payment of this 
sum more effectually, obtained a lease for nineteen 
years of the rents of the archbishopric; and this has 
been periodically renewed by the Crown. Queen 
Anne, George I., II., and III., likewise presented 
the college with presentations and donations. 

By the constitution of the University, the office of 
Chancellor is usually filled, as at present, by some 
nobleman or other gentleman of rank in the country. 
He is chosen by the rector, dean of faculty, princi¬ 
pal, and professors. The chancellor being the head 
of the University, presides in all its councils; and 
in his name all academical degrees are bestowed. 

The Rector is chosen annually in the comitia; that 
is, in a court, in which all the students, on this par- 





Manner of electing the Rector of the University. 141 

ticular occasion, after matriculation, * are entitled to 
vote, as well as the other members of the University. 

The election, which takes place in November, is 
conducted in the following manner. The whole of 
the matriculated students meet in the Common Hall, 
when the general roll is called, and the names of all 
present marked; after which the voters are arranged 
into four general classes or nations according to the 
place of their birth. These are denominated, Glot - 
tiana , Transforthana, Loudoniana , and Rolhsalana. 
In each nation the vote of every individual is taken, 
and the voice of the majority constitutes the vote of 
that nation. Reporters are then chosen from each* 
who return to the Common Hall and intimate the 
vote of their different nations, the majority of which 
decides the election. If the nations are equally di¬ 
vided, the former rector has the casting vote. 

The Rector, with the advice of his assessors, whom 
he nominates, judges in all disputes among the stu¬ 
dents, and between them and the citizens. He also 
convokes and presides in the meetings of the Uni¬ 
versity called for the election of his successor, or for 
preparing addresses to the king, electing a member 
to the general assembly, and other important mat¬ 
ters. 

The officer next in rank is the Dean of Faculty, 
who is chosen annually by the rector, principal, and

professors. His office consists in giving directions 
with regard to the course of studies; in judging, 
together with the rector, principal, and professors, 
of the qualifications of those who desire to take aca¬ 
demical degrees; and, in such meetings as are called 
for these purposes, he always presides. 

The college, thdugh in some measure surrounded 
by the houses of the town, is possessed of more than 
20 acres of ground adjacent to its buildings. 

Considered as an incorporation, it possesses con¬ 
siderable funds, which are managed by the principal 
and professors, who, from time to time, with the 
consent of the Privy Council, fix the extent of their 
own salaries, which are moderate; so that their per¬ 
sonal wealth depends in a great degree upon the fees 
received from students. 

DESCRIPTION OF ITS BUILDINGS. 

The University of Glasgow occupies a space of 
9556 square yards, and is situated about half-way 
up, and on the east side of, the High-street, to which 
it presents a front, 305 feet in length. This is built 
of hewn stone, and consists of three stories, with as 
many tiers of windows. The chief gate is in its 
centre, and ornamented with frosted work. Imme¬ 
diately above it are placed the Royal Arms, cut in 
bas-relief, and gilt. On each side, is a balcony sup¬ 
ported upon consols, projecting five feet from the 
wall. By a lofty arched gate, towards the north, is 
an entrance from the street into a court, where seve- 




Valuable portraits preserved in the Faculty-hall.

ral of the professors reside. In its centre is a well, 
built of polished stone in the Egyptian style. An¬ 
other gate, on the south, leads into a garden and 
area belonging to the Principal of the University. ' 

Directly behind the front, the entrance by the 
main gate conducts to three courts in succession. 
The first is 88 feet long and 44 broad. On the 
right hand is a broad staircase, consisting of two 
flights, conducting to the Faculty-hall. A balus¬ 
trade incloses it on each side, and in the middle of 
the ascent are placed figures of the lion and unicorn, 
cut in stone. In this hall are two historical paint¬ 
ings, the Taking down from the Cross, after Ra¬ 
phael, and the Martyrdom of St. Catherine, by 
Kosher; also portraits of the celebrated Dr. Wil¬ 
liam Hunter of London, the present Earl of Buchan, 
Baron Napier the inventor of the Logarithms, John 
Knox, George Buchanan, Zachary Boyd the versifier 
of the Bible, John Orr, Esq. of Barrowfield, Profes¬ 
sor Simson, Principal Leechman, Professor Hutche¬ 
son, and Dr. Tobias Smollett. In the same court 
are the Divinity-hall and Library, and apartments 
for different classes. The Divinity-hall contains 
portraits of Martin Luther, William III. and Mary 
his queen. Queen Anne, and of several eminent pro¬ 
fessors of the College. 

Over the passage from the first to the second 
court is the steeple. It has a good clock, and is 
protected against lightning by a metallic rod, which 
rises higher than the vane, and is carried down 185

feet to the earth. In the inner court are class-rooms 
and other apartments. The east side, after having 
stood 220 years, was taken down and rebuilt in 
1810, at an expense of &lt;£8000. It fronts the east, 
and is 159 feet in length, by 50 in breadth. It 
contains the Latin, Greek, Logic, Chemical, Anato¬ 
mical, Medical, and Mathematical class-rooms, and 
a Common Hall, 73 feet in length by 40 in breadth, 
and distributed into 990 seats. Under this is an 
arch-way conducting to the third court, formed by 
the new buildings on the west, the Library on the 
south, the Museum on the east, and a wing of the 
professors* houses on the north. The new front is 
divided into five compartments. That in the centre 
projects about 3}j feet from the plane of the wall. 
The basement is done of chamfered rustic work, and 
supports four engaged columns of the Doric order, 
each three feet diameter, and finished with entabla¬ 
ture and pediment. The end compartments have 
each three panneled pilasters; the intermediate 
parts are plain, and finished above the cornice with 
a balustrade. 

The Library is a handsome well-lighted building, 
and contains a neat gallery supported by pillars. 
Towards the erection of this, a late Duke of Chan- 
dos gave £500, when he visited the college. Here 
are kept, for the use of the professors and students, 
more than forty thousand volumes, many of which 
are exceedingly scarce, and some no where else to 
be found. Among the last class are several valuable

manuscripts, particularly a version of the Bible, 
written about four hundred years ago upon parch¬ 
ment, and curiously illuminated with small emble¬ 
matical paintings at the beginning of each chapter. 

The Hunterian Museum was left, in trust, by the 
celebrated Dr. William Hunter * of London, to the 
professors of the College of Glasgow. It consists of 
rich collections of minerals and fossils; of plants; 
of shells, fishes, beasts, birds, and reptiles of various 
kinds; of rare and valuable manuscripts and printed 
books; of coins and medals, together with many 
other productions of Nature and Art. The collec¬ 
tion of coins and medals is supposed to be the most 
valuable in the world, the Royal Collection of Paris 
excepted. Men of literature and science have free 
access to it upon proper application to the Trustees; 
and others w r ho wish merely to see the rooms, the 
paintings, and such parts of the Collection as can be 
publicly exhibited, are admitted by tickets at two 
shillings each, which are to be had from the College- 
porter. The money arising from these is applied to 
the support and enlargement of the Collection. The 
hours of admittance are from noon till 2 p.m. 

The whole of this princely donation is deposited 
in an appropriate building, erected after designs by 


* Dr. Hunter was born in 1718 at East-Kilbride, a village about eight miles 
south-east from Glasgow, and educated at this University, from which he 
obtained the degree of Doctor in Medicine in 1750. He died in 1783. The 
value of the Museum is estimated at upwards of £120,000. An account of 
it was published in 1813, by Captain J. Laskey.

146 Interior arrangement of the Hunterian Museum. 

Mr. William Stark of Edinburgh. It was founded 
on the first of August, 1804, in the presence of the 
Dean of Faculty, Principal, and Professors in their 
gowns. In the foundation-stone were enclosed, a 
crystal bottle, cast on purpose at the Glasgow Ver- 
reville Works, containing the different British coins 
then in currency, and several papers respecting the 
present interesting state of the country. 

This elegant structure constitutes the eastern side 
of the third court of the University-buildings, and 
projects into the College-garden. The entrance 
front forms a Roman-Doric portico of six columns, 
the whole height of the building. The ascent to 
the principal floor is by a flight of steps the whole 
length of the portico. The other front, looking to¬ 
wards the garden, forms the same contour, except 
that in place of columns, pilasters are used, inter- 
filled with windows, and without the flight of steps. 
The edifice exhibits the temple style, being crowned 
with a stone cupola, and is esteemed the best imi¬ 
tation of classical building in Great Britain. In the 
interior the chief floor contains a hall for antiquities, 
23^ feet diameter, with residing compartments for 
anatomical preparations, minerals, corals, and other 
natural productions. In the attic floor, are the pic¬ 
ture-gallery, library, study, medal, and consulting 
rooms. The basement is occupied by the Hall of 
the Elephant, 42 feet by 23, with apartments for the 
keeper, and stove-rooms. Other rooms will after¬ 
wards be fitted up for the reception of future addi-

tions to the museum. The sum of &lt;£10,000 has 
been expended in erecting the building, bringing 
down the collection from London, and arranging it. 

The Garden of the University of ten acres, is laid 
out in walks lined with trees, and kept in grass. It 
declines gently towards the Molendinar-bourn on the 
east, and is surrounded by a high wall. It is used 
as a public walk, or place of amusement for the stu¬ 
dents; who, in 1818, amounted to upwards of 1400. 

Beyond the Molendinar-bourn, over which a 
bridge is thrown, the ground ascends, and in an ele¬ 
vated situation is placed the Macfarlane Observatory, 
so named in honour of Alexander Macfarlane, Esq., 
of Jamaica, who, in 1757, bequeathed his valuable 
apparatus of astronomical instruments to the Uni¬ 
versity. Under each of the four corners of this 
building was deposited a medal, having on one side 
the inscription, 

OB3ERVATORII MACFARLANEI FUNDAMENTA JECIT, 

ALMA MATER GLASGUENSIS, XVII AUG. MDCCLVII. 

On the other side is a portion of a convex celestial 
sphere, with the constellations, and round it these 
words, 

FELICES ANIMiE QU1BUS H/EC COGNOSCERE CURA. 

Besides the original astronomical apparatus, the 
Observatory possesses a reflecting telescope, con¬ 
structed by Herschel, ten feet in length, and ten 
inches diameter. 

The University has a professor in each of the 
following departments, nominated by the Senatus 
Academicus or Crown.

The Session of College begins in October or No¬ 
vember, and terminates in May or June in different 
classes. That of Botany commences on the 1st day 
of May. Those who attend the Humanity, Greek, 
Logic, Natural, and Moral Philosophy classes, are 
required to wear scarlet gowns. The students do 
not reside in the University, but in private houses. 
Degrees are granted by the Senatus Academicus 
after examination; but that of doctor in divinity 
and doctor of laws is here, as in the other Scottish 
Universities, considered as honorary. The latter, 
however, may be obtained at Glasgow, by submit¬ 
ting to prescribed examinations. 

Degrees in Medicine are conferred in conformity 
to the following regulations. The candidate shall 
appear personally, before the senate of the Univer-

space of three years, or Sessions of six months each, 
he lias regularly attended, in some University or

Anatomy and Surgery, Chemistry and Pharmacy, 
Theory and Practice of Physic, Materia Medica, 
and Botany; and, that during one year, at least, he 
has attended the medical classes in this University. 
—He shall undergo three separate examinations in 
private by the medical professors, and write a com¬ 
mentary on an aphorism of Hippocrates, and ano¬ 
ther on a case of disease propounded to him by the 
examiners. The first examination to be on anatomy 
and physiology, the second on the theory and prac¬ 
tice of physic, and the third on chemistry, materia 
medica, pharmacy, and botany.—The examiners 
shall report to the senate their opinion respecting 
the medical knowledge of the applicant; and, if 
this be favourable, his name, as a candidate for a 
degree, shall be entered in the minutes, and a day 
fixed, w r hen he shall read his commentaries on the 
aphorism and case, and answer such questions as 
may be put to him in presence of the senate. If 
the senate be of opinion that he is worthy of a de¬ 
gree, it shall be conferred, in their presence, by the 
Vice-chancellor, provided the candidate has not 
published a thesis, which he may do or not, accord- 
r ing to option: but if he has, he must defend it, and 
the degree be conferred in the Comitia.—All the 
examinations shall be carried on, and the commen¬ 
taries must be written, in the Latin language.

Description of the Town-hall. 


TOWN-HALL 

was built in 1636, on the north side of the Trongate 
where it commences at the Cross. The basement of 
its front forms a rusticated arcade, with sculptured 
heads upon the key-stones ; and, immediately above 
it, a range of Ionic pilasters fluted, with their en¬ 
tablature. Over this is a balustrade, with vases 
above each pilaster. The arcade forms a spacious 
piazza. The Hall is 24 feet in height, and 55 by 27 
in length, with a coved ceiling. Its wails contain 
trophies and several portraits of the kings of Great 
Britain, and a masterly one, by Ramsay, of Archi¬ 
bald Duke of Argyle, in his robes, as Lord-justice- 
general. The bust of George III. in bronze, is 
placed over the mantle-piece, and the statue of Pitt, 
in marble, by Flaxman, between two colums, in re¬ 
presentation of porphyry, at the east end of the hall. 






Site of the old Jail.—Tontine Coffee-room. 1'51 

The old Jail, * * built in 1636, stood at the east end 
of the Town-hall, but having become too small, was 
sold in 1812 by public roup, to Mr. James Cleland, 
for &lt;£8000, being something more than £45 per 
square yard for the ground. This sale was made 
under the express stipulation that the structure 
should be replaced by another after a design by 
Mr. D. Hamilton, ornamented with turrets and em¬ 
brasures. The ancient steeple is preserved, and 
projects on the High-street. It is 126 feet high, 
terminates in an imperial crown, and contains a 
clock, bell, and musical chimes so arranged, as to 
play a tune t at the end of every two hours, chang¬ 
ing daily at twelve o’clock, noon. 

TONTINE COFFEE-ROOM AND HOTEL. 

The first is built behind the piazza of the Town- 
hall. It was erected, in 1781, by Tontine-subscrip¬ 
tion, J of 107 shares at £50 each. The plans were

ment, by amusing them with the hope of becoming suddenly rich.—The 
nature of the Tontine is this; there is an annuity, after a certain rate of in-

done by Mr. William Hamilton, a very ingenious 
architect; and under his superintendence the work 
was completed. In digging the foundation, a boat 
was found, imbedded in sand and gravel, several 
feet below the surface, where it must have lain for 
ages; which may indicate that the bed of the ri¬ 
ver had once run in this direction. The Coffee- 
room is 74 feet in length, by 32 J in breadth, and 
in height, and is universally allowed to be the 
most elegant of the kind in Britain, and, perhaps, 
in Europe. The entrance is from the Trongate, 
under the piazza. Upon each side of the door are 
placed two large windows, from the floor to the 
roof, which communicate the light to the room from 
the street. About half way down the Coffee-room, 
is a very large Venetian window 7 upon the east, and 
on the other side, exactly opposite, is another, look¬ 
ing into the bar, upon the north side of which, is a 
door communicating with the Hotel. The extremity 
of the room northward, is in the form of a bow, di¬ 
vided by pillars, making one complete magnificent 
window from side to side. Near to the main entry, 
the roof, which is very high, is supported by columns 
of the Doric order, with correspondent pilasters upon 
the walls, and in this place, a dome of glass enlight¬ 
ens, with the other end windows, the south side of 


terest, granted to a number of people, divided into classes according to their 
respective ages; so that annually the whole fund of each class is divided 
among the survivors of that class, till at last it falls to one, and, upon the 
extinction of that life, reverts to the power by which the Tontine was erec¬ 
ted, and which becomes thereby security for the due payment of the annui¬

the room. From the roof also, are hung several ele¬ 
gantly gilt lustres, which, when lighted, give an air 
ot grandeur to the place, pleasantly demonstrative 
of the riches and taste of the city. 

Around the inside of the bow, as well as the four 
fire-places, are ranged the seats for the subscribers. 
Between the door and the large windows upon each 
side, is a space upon the wall for advertisements, 
and immediately below, a small desk with a book, 
wherein the arrivals and departures of the several 
vessels, connected with the city, are daily marked 
down. Subscribers of £l: 12 per annum, are en¬ 
titled to the use of the room, newspapers and maga¬ 
zines; of which no Coffee-room in Britain can boast 
a greater variety. Here are received not only all the 
Scottish newspapers, but also the greatest part of 
those published in London, together with some from 
Ireland, France, Germany, and other parts on the 
Continent. To these are added a select diversity of 
the most popular and fashionable periodical works. 
The daily arrival of the mail produces a very cha¬ 
racteristic scene; all being then full of bustle and 
vivacity. Throughout the day, also, the room is 
crowded with the concourse of subscribers, who as¬ 
semble there to learn the news, to meet their friends, 
or to do business. Strangers too, with a liberality 
peculiar to this city, are invited and freely permitted 
to avail themselves of all the advantages that so spi¬ 
rited an institution affords its supporters. The Hotel 
consists of a suite of apartments handsomely fitted 
up, immediately adjoining the Coffee-room and Ex¬ 
change, and to which the main entry leads from the

south, by a fine hanging stair. Under the piazzas of 
the Exchange are placed several other distinct rooms, 
occupied by under-writers, insurance-brokers, and 
others. The Tontine Coffee-room and Hotel, with 
the other buildings, at present produce a rent of 
above £1000 per annum. The subscribers this year 
are 1189. Only 68 of the original proprietors are 
now alive. 


THE MERCHANTS’ HALL 

consists of two stories of ashler work, and stands on 
the south side of the Bridgegate and near its western 
extremity. Its foundation was laid in 1651, and the 
building finished in l659; by voluntary subscription, 
when Mr. James Barnes was Dean of Guild; and 
when the population of Glasgow did not include 
10,000 souls, nor had a ship of her merchants as yet 
crossed the Atlantic. 

The ground fiat, on each side of the great door 
which is ornamented with two Doric pillars and 
entablature, is occupied as shops. Above this is a 
range of large windows, dressed with pediments, 
which give light to the Hall. Immediately above 
the door, two Ionic columns enclose a sculpture in 
bas-relief, representing a ship sailing, and, in another 
compartment, three old men in the habit of pilgrims: 
below, is the inscription,

Description of the spire of the Merchants’ Hall.—Town-hospital. 155 

The Hall is 80 feet, by 30, in length. In it is 
hung a list of all the Deans of Guild of the city, from 
the erection of the Guildry in 1605, to the present 
time. Here are, also, portraits of its most eminent 
benefactors. It is well lighted from the north, and 
contains two fire-places on the opposite sides. From 
the centre of the roof is suspended a large and beau¬ 
tiful model of a ship, with her whole tackling. 

Immediately adjoining this building, on the south, 
is a very handsome and lofty steeple, 1 64&gt; feet in 
height, the finest in the city. After rising 85 feet, 
in the form of a square tower, it is surrounded by a 
balustrade. From within this it rises again, in the 
same form, but of a more contracted diameter, till it 
meets with another from which it springs as before. 
A third balustrade embraces it, and from this issues a 
pyramidal spire, terminated by the figure of a gilded 
ship. 

This building was from designs by Sir William 
Bruce of Kinross, architect to Charles II. *

* This ancient edifice having become inadequate to its designed use, was 
sold by the Directors of the Merchants’ House, in September 1817, to Messrs. 
Carsewell, builders, for the sum of £7500 sterling, under the express con¬ 
ditions that the height of the new buildings they intend to erect, should not 
injure the appearance of the spire. 

It is proposed to erect a new Hall, corresponding to the commercial 
wealth of the city. The site of the building has not yet been determined on.

and difficulties attending the system of maintaining 
the poor in their own houses—the impossibility of 
always selecting proper and deserving objects, and 
the impracticability of finding persons qualified to 
undertake the management and distribution of the 
charity. Glasgow was the first place in Scotland 
where an hospital was erected, and the earliest inti¬ 
mation that remains on record, regarding the adop¬ 
tion of the plan, is a minute of the Magistrates and 
Council, dated 7th January, 1731. The present 
buildings were erected in 1733, from voluntary 
contributions, by the inhabitants of the city. The 
buildings form a quadrangle, the area in the centre 
being used as airing ground for the paupers. The 
principal range, fronting Clyde-street, consists of a 
centre compartment, with two projecting wings, of 
three stories, and contains the great hall where the 
inmates assemble for family worship, the committee 
room, * and other apartments for the use of the 
hospital. On the other sides of the quadrangle are 
disposed those parts of the building which are chiefly 
fitted up for the reception of the sick and fatuous 
persons on the establishment. The insane were 
removed to the Lunatic Asylum, in 1814. The 
interior disposition of the house is suited for the 
accommodation of upwards of 400. At present, 
there are 471 paupers in the hospital. The ex-

the institution, and a monument in marble to the memory of the late Wil¬

penses of the establishment are defrayed by an as¬ 
sessment upon those inhabitants who do business 
in the town, and who have an income of £300. A 
considerable sum is also contributed by the Town- 
council, Merchants’ House, Trades’ House, and Ge¬ 
neral Session. The expenditure for the last year, 
ending 1st January, 1818, amounted to upwards of 
£13,000. 

Every person in the hospital, capable of working, 
is employed; the young make bobbin-lace, and fill- 
in fleece cards; the old spin, weave, make and mend 
clothes and shoes, tease oakum, and discharge the 
duties of nurses for the sick and infirm. The chil¬ 
dren, accompanied by the chaplain, attend divine 
service on Sundays, in the College Church; and are 
instructed during the week in reading, writing, and 
church music. The appearance of the exterior is 
simple and neat, corresponding with the humble and 
benevolent uses to which the house is applied. 

The extent on which the present hospital stands, 
including the open area, is upwards of 5500 square 
yards; and, with the materials, the whole is calcu¬ 
lated to be worth £7000. 

Although the hospital seems to have been judi¬ 
ciously arranged, and sufficiently large for the popu¬ 
lation of this city at the time of its commencement, 
85 years ago, yet it is not in plan or arrangement 
found suitable to the present improved system of 
polity as to the maintenance and management of the 
poor, nor in extent at all adequate to the increased 
population of Glasgow. The situation does not pos-

sess the advantages which it had in 1733; at that 
time it stood in the centre of the Old Green, now it 
is surrounded on three sides with houses. Conside¬ 
rations such as these operating with the Directors, 
a resolution was formed to dispose of the present 
hospital, and to purchase ground for erecting a new 
house in some eligible situation. They were enabled 
to purchase, in 1817&gt; a piece of ground, possessing 
every local advantage wanted for the purposes of the 
hospital, in consequence of the lands of Spring Gar¬ 
dens, near the High Church, having been exposed 
to sale, consisting of 12,000 square yards, chiefly 
enclosed w ith walls, at the price of £3300. Here 
it is proposed to erect an hospital, in which modern 
improvements may be combined with that enlarge¬ 
ment and increase of accommodation which the mag¬ 
nitude of this city requires. It is estimated to cost 
£ 10 , 000 .* 


* That the new hospital might acquire all the advantages to be derived 
from the experience of other establishments, and the united talents of in¬ 
dividuals, a Committee was appointed to consider and report, on the most 
approved plan, the size, regulations, and constitution, for the new hospital. 
The framing of this report devolved upon James Ewing, Esq., Convener of 
the Committee; who, upon the 7th of January, 1818, brought forward the 
report at a meeting of the Committee, when the thanks of the members 
were unanimously voted to Mr. Ewing for the great research and ability 
displayed in the report; and it was resolved that it should be printed and 
circulated, for the consideration of the Directors. This has been done, and 
the work reflects equal credit upon the heart and head of Mr. Ewing. His 
fellow-citizens may indeed rejoice that they have among them a gentleman, 
who, in the cause of humanity', will bestow the time and research adequate 
to the production of such a report, and exert those talents he has displayed 
in the work before the public. The able author has embodied in language 
perspicuous and elegant, extensive and accurate knowledge of the great 
principles which enter into the important subject of pauperism. The pro¬ 
posals made are judicious and simple, the reflections ingenious and correct, 
and the whole is an able and luminous digest of the most approved systems.

ROYAL INFIRMARY. 

This beautiful building stands nearly at the upper 
end of the High-street. It has a light airy appear¬ 
ance, and was designed by the late celebrated Robert 
and James Adam. 

Its general form is that of a parallelogram, running 
east and west. On the front, and at each side, are 
two projections of five feet deep, and in the centre 
another still more considerable. It consists of four 
stories, the basement of which is rusticated. On the 
centre projection, rise four Corinthian columns in¬ 
sulated, with corresponding pilasters upon the wall. 
These support their entablature, and a triangular 
pediment, above which is a balustrade, with the 
royal arms cut in alto relievo. Immediately over this, 
and in the centre of the building, is a large and lofty 
dome lighted upon all sides. 

On the east and west wings are two very fine 
Venetian windows, corresponding to one upon the 
same level, under the portico, formed by the middle 
columns. These windows and the columns reach the 
height of two ranges; and a little above, an elegant 
cornice runs along the building, exactly upon the 
level with the entablature over the central portico. 
Another tier of windows forms an attic, of less 
height than those in the two last stories; and after 
these, another smaller cornice terminates and crowns 
the building. The end fronts of the edifice, as well 
as the north front, are handsomely finished, and well 
lighted, by successive tiers of windows, correspon-

dent with those upon the principal front. The whole 
of the exterior is executed in hewn stone. In point 
of situation, good air, abundance of water, and con¬ 
venient accommodation for the patients, this Infir¬ 
mary is not excelled by any other establishment of 
the same kind in Britain. It was opened for the 
reception of patients on the 8th December, 1794*; 
and since that time, its beneficial and salutary effects 
have been so much felt, that it is now considered as 
a public benefit and blessing to this part of the coun¬ 
try. 

The Infirmary originally contained eight wards, 
with seventeen beds in each, and could accommodate 
136 patients. In 1816, the Managers, at an expense 
of &lt;£4000, raised by subscriptions and donations, * 
constructed an addition at the back of the building, 
divided into four wards, admitting seventy-two beds, 
thereby furnishing means for the reception of 208 
patients in all. The Institution is supported by vo¬ 
luntary contribution, placed under the management 
of twenty-five Directors, who choose two physicians, 
four surgeons, treasurer, secretary, and clerk; with 
an apothecary, chaplain, two physicians’ clerks, sur¬ 
geons’ clerk, matron, and porter, t 


* Matthew Maclicn, Esq., merchant in Glasgow, on May 15th, 1816, 
bequeathed the princely sum of £1000 to the Royal Infirmary, to be invested 
in heritable securities. 

f The expenditure of the Infirmary, from January 1817 to January 1818, 
for medicines, salaries of servants, coals, repairs of the house, &amp;c., including 
a small balance in the Treasurer’s hands, amounted to £5259:18:10. 

In consequence of the funds being very low, a collection took place at 
the different churches, in February 1818, for the benefit of the Infirmary, 
when the sum of £890:15 was raised. 





Inscription in the foundation-stone of the Royal Infirmary. 161 

The foundation-stone of this chaste edifice was 
laid on the 18th of May, 1792, in presence of the 
lord provost, magistrates, principal and professors 
of the University, and other public bodies, with a 
vast concourse of spectators. Two crystal bottles 
were deposited in the stone. In one of them were 
put different coins of the present reign; in the other, 
several specimens of the Glasgow muslin manufac¬ 
tures, a printed copy of the Infirmary charter, a copy 
of each of the Glasgow newspapers, and a writing 
containing the names of the magistrates and council, 
and principal and professors of the University, &amp;c .;

Terms of board for the patients in the Lunatic Asylum. 


1C2 


THE LUNATIC ASYLUM 

stands on the north-west side of the city, and, with 
the airing grounds, occupies about four acres. It 
consists of an octagonal centre, from which diverge 
four wings of three stories each. In the centre are 
apartments for the superintendent and assistants, and 
day-rooms for the patients, when the state of their 
disorder requires it. The wings contain each, a large 
gallery for exercise, and one row of chambers, admi¬ 
rably situated, both for the health of the patients, 
and the immediate access of the keepers, to all parts 
of the house. The whole plan is so arranged, that 
the patients are divided into different classes, accord¬ 
ing to sex, and rank in life, and according to their 
different degrees of insanity. The same division is 
observed in the grounds for exercise, to which each 
class is separately admitted. It contains 136 apart¬ 
ments, which accommodates 126 patients, exclusively 
of those set apart for the housekeeper, apothecary, 
superintendent, physician, and committee. All the 
apartments are rendered comfortable by the intro¬ 
duction of rarefied air, generated in the sunk story, 
and communicated through concealed flues. The 
weekly board is 8s. for paupers from Glasgow, or 
those towns and parishes which have contributed 
£50 to the institution for every 1500 inhabitants 
they contain; for all others it is 10s. 6d. a week. 
The charge for the middle and higher classes varies 
from 15s. a week to three guineas, for which the

lodgers receive suitable accommodation, attendance, 
and aliment. 

The exterior of the building is of rubble work, and 
the four fronts of the central part are decorated with 
pilasters, the cornice of which runs round the whole 
building. Over the octagonal centre, rises a circular 
attic story, in which are infirmary rooms, and apart¬ 
ments for servants. From the top of this rises an 
octagonal compartment, of a smaller diameter, in 
which is a neat chapel, surmounted by a dome, sup¬ 
ported in the inside by columns. In the sides of the 
dome are eight large windows, which light the chapel 
and the great staircase to the bottom. 

The projection of the wings in every direction, the 
circular attic rising from the centre, and the octa¬ 
gonal dome with its pyramidic termination, give the 
asylum a grand and striking effect. The architect 
has admirably overcome the difficulties arising out 
of his peculiar design. By correctly proportioning 
the wards to the central buildings, by surmounting 
these with an attic, and by crowning the centre with 
a magnificent dome, he has imparted to this edifice 
a character which blends elegance with dignity, and 
wdll secure to it a place among the most eminent 
works of art. 

This Asylum is supposed to be the only building 
of that form in the kingdom, and the best adapted 
to its purpose of any in Europe. In the foundation- 
stone were deposited three bottles, filled with gold, 
silver, and copper coins of the present reign, and 
another containing an almanack of the current year.

energetic and appropriate speech. To this Mr. Ro¬ 
bert M'Nair of Belvidere, the humane projector of the 
Institution, made a suitable and perspicuous reply. 
The expense of this structure, the erection of which 
was conducted by Mr. John Weir, from designs by 
Mr. William Stark, amounted to upwards of &lt;£18,000. 

THE SURGEONS’ HALE 

was built in 179L on the east side of St. Enoch’s- 
square, from designs by Mr. John Craig, at an ex¬ 
pense of £1,050, and is two stories in height; the 
first of rusticated work, finished above the cornice 
with balustrades. In the middle, and at each end, 
are Ionic pilasters with entablature. Between these 
is a Venetian window, which, with two square ones, 
lightens the Hall. In the centre of the basement, 
the door conducts into a lobby hung round-with 
portraits of Hippocrates, Galen, and other eminent 
masters in the medical school. On each side are 
apartments, and at the extremity is a fine stair, 
leading to the Hall, which is lofty, large, and well 
finished. The Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons 
meet in this, and transact the business of the society. 
Here, also, is kept the Library, containing a good 
collection of professional books. The apartment is 
ornamented with a painting of Hygeia, the Goddess 
of Health, surrounded with a group of figures em¬ 
blematical of the Healing Art. 

HUTCHESONS’ HOSPITAL 

was erected in 1803, at an expense of £4,800, from 
a design by Mr. D. Hamilton, and is situated in 





166 The Observatory. 

Ingram-street, facing the street of the same name. 
It extends 59 feet in front, by 55 in depth, and 
forms an elegant termination to the street. The 
basement is of rusticated work, adorned with Corin¬ 
thian columns and entablature, over which is an or¬ 
namented attic. It has a handsome octagonal spire, 
15b feet in height, rising from the back part of the 
structure. The whole of the building is appropriated 
to the purposes of the institution, except a spacious 
room wherein Stirling’s Library is kept. 

THE OBSERVATORY, 

situated on Garnett-hill, was erected in 1810, from 
designs by Mr. Webster of London, in the Egyptian 
style of architecture, and is divided into three de¬ 
partments. The first forms a scientific observatory 
for the purpose of watching and recording the ce¬ 
lestial phenomena, in order to promote the general 
interests of science. The second is popular, and 
furnished with every instrument capable of blending 
instruction with amusement. A camera-obscura- 
apparatus, on a great scale, introduces a vivid repre¬ 
sentation of the surrounding landscape, composing a 
living, moving, and ever-varying panorama, surpass¬ 
ing as far the finest works of the pencil, as nature is 
superior to art. Telescopes of different kinds display 
the magnificent host of heaven, while the solar mi¬

is reasonably expected, that a considerable revenue 
may be derived from this part of the establishment. 
It is the only one to which the public will be indis¬ 
criminately admitted.—The third is dedicated to the 
accommodation of the subscribers. It is furnished 
with maps, charts, and globes, of the largest dimen¬ 
sions and finest execution, and also provided with 
valuable treatises on astronomy, navigation, and com¬ 
merce. The meteorological instruments, destined 
to indicate with accuracy the existing state, and 
approaching changes, of the weather, are also ar¬ 
ranged in this room. On an adjoining terrace, is 
placed the grand telescope of Herschel.—To the 
delicate scientific instruments, the subscribers alone 
will have access. To execute this plan, three thou¬ 
sand pounds were required. This sum was raised by 
one hundred and fifty shares of twenty pounds each. 
The share is heritable and transferable property, and 
the subscribers are as select as possible. The con¬ 
struction, superintendence, and management, of the 
institution, is vested in the proprietors, or in a com¬ 
mittee appointed by them at a general meeting. In 
the foundation-stone were deposited some newspa¬ 
pers, several medals, and a plate containing the 
following inscription: 


insects were discovered devouring the body of a gnat, and scores had lived 
luxuriously for several months on the leg of a moth. These animalcula? 
were magnified so as to appear nine inches long, their actual size being 
somewhat less than the fourteen hundredth part of an inch. The mineral 
kingdom afforded another display of brilliant objects; their crystallization, 
and the splendour of their colouring, exceed any thing the most lively 
imagination can possibly conceive.

ANDERSON’S INSTITUTION. 

In 1798 the managers of the Institution purchased 
a building in John-street, having an ashler front, 
relieved by mouldings, and terminating in a balus¬ 
trade and pediment, with a roof in form of a dome. 
In this they fitted up a spacious circular Hall, 45 
feet in diameter, which can accommodate 500 audi¬ 
tors. There are, likewise, other apartments and 
conveniences for containing the library, museum, 
and apparatus. To the original stock of these, con¬ 
siderable additions have been made, by donation 
and purchase; and the managers have also procured 
every article necessary for furnishing complete illus¬ 
trations of experimental philosophy and chemistry. 

The Institution was incorporated, on June 9th, 
1796, by a charter from the Magistrates of the city. 
It was established by the late Mr. John Anderson, 
Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University, 
who for that purpose, by his will, endowed it with 
his valuable philosophical apparatus, museum, and 
library. It was placed under the inspection and 
control of the Lord Provost, the senior baillie, dean 
of guild, deacon convener, president of the Faculty 
of Physicians and Surgeons, dean of the Procurators, 



Branches of education taught in Anderson’s Institution. 1G9 

and the moderators of the Synod of Glasgow and 
Ayr, and of the Presbyteries of Glasgow and Dun¬ 
barton, any six of whom to be a quorum. The 
immediate superintendence is vested in eighty-one 
trustees, consisting of gentlemen conversant with the 
arts and sciences; from these nine persons are elected 
annually, to whom the principal part of the manage¬ 
ment is committed. 

The views of the venerable founder of this scien¬ 
tific seminary embraced a complete circle of liberal 
education, adapted to the present improved state of 
society. His intentions were directed towards the 
establishment of four colleges, viz. one of Arts, one 
of Medicine, another of Law, and a fourth of Theo¬ 
logy. Circumstances, however, have hitherto limited 
the plan to Physical Science, comprehending Natural 
Philosophy, Chemistry, Materia Medica, and Phar¬ 
macy. There is also a Mechanics’ Class, to which 
a considerable library is appropriated. 

The collection of models and apparatus, in this 
seminary, is very extensive and various, and has 
been essentially useful in promoting the public im¬ 
provement. The school also exhibits a peculiar trait, 
by affording to all ranks, and either sex, an easy 
access to the sublime principles of philosophy. 

Popular and scientific lectures were first given in 
the Institution, by the late Dr. Thomas Garnett. He 
was succeeded by Dr. George Birbeck, who added 
a course of geography and astronomy, and another, 
upon a plain and elementary plan, for the advantage 
of persons engaged in mechanic and chemical arts.

The Professorship of Natural Philosophy and Che¬ 
mistry is at present filled by Dr. Andrew Ure; Dr. 
Cumin, Professor of Botany, delivers lectures on that 
science; and Dr. Pattison is Professor of Anatomy 
and Surgery. * 

THE MAGDALENE ASYLUM 

was erected in 1812, from designs by Mr. James 
Cleland, and is supported by voluntary contribution. 
It is situated on the east of the Lunatic Asylum, 
and is designed for the reception of those unfortu¬ 
nate females who have become desirous of returning 
to the paths of virtue. It consists of three stories: 
the front is divided into a centre and projecting 
wings, terminating in pediments. Apartments are 
arranged in it for a matron, the committee, and 34* 
penitents. The chapel, exclusively of the gallery, 
admits 150 persons. A high wall encloses the 
edifice, together with more than an acre of ground. 

THE TRADES’ HALL 

is situated on the west side of Glassford-street, front¬ 
ing Garthland-street, and forms a central building 
with two wings. It consists of three stories, the first 
of which is rusticated and ornamented by doors in 
the Venetian style. The main door is placed in a

the Institution.

projection, which, on the base of the second story, 
supports four Doric columns, with a triangular pe¬ 
diment. Immediately under this is a large Venetian 
window, which lightens the Hall. Similar windows, 
upon the same level, are in each wing, between 
which and the great central window are two square 
ones, decorated at the top with cornices, and figures 
ol griffins cut in bas-relief. Corresponding windows 
light the third story, which is terminated by a 
handsome balustrade of stone, upon which rest the 
city anus, cut in alto relievo, supported by two 
female figures, as large as life, in a recumbent pos¬ 
ture. From the roof rises a dome covered with lead, 
ending in a fane. 

Upon entering the main door and passing the 
lobby, a hansrinsr stair, which at the end of the first 
flight divides to the right and left, conducts into the 

Hall, a fine room, 70 feet long, 35 feet wide, and 2 4 
feet high, and, excepting the Assembly Rooms, the 
most spacious in the city. The roof is decorated 
with stucco work, in a light and elegant style; above 
the door is a handsome clock, and an inscription in 
gold letters, of the date of opening the Hall. The 
other apartments are well finished and ornamented, 
and serve as committee-rooms. Portraits of persons 
of the Trades’ Rank, who had made donations to the 
house, and the arms of the fourteen incorporated 
bodies, are hung round the walls. The expense of 
this building was £5500.

ASSEMJBEY AND CONCERT ROOMS 

were built by Tontine shares of £20 each, and are 
situated upon the north side, near the western ex¬ 
tremity, of Ingram-street. The foundation was laid 
on the 11th of March, 179^. The basement story, 
which is rusticated, has a very deep square projec¬ 
tion from the middle of the front, supporting four 
Ionic columns, with their correspondent pilasters 
and entablature. Between these columns is placed 
the large centre Venetian window, which, with the 
tw o others on each side of the projection, give light 
to the hall. Four similar pilasters, with those im¬ 
mediately behind the central columns, ornament the 
building at the corners, and rise to an equal height; 
so that the same cornice, which is very deep, runs

along the top of the whole. The front rises a few 
feet above this cornice, and terminates in stone ba¬ 
lusters. 

Upon entering the main door there is a handsome 
lobby, supported by Doric pillars ; to the right and 
left of which are situated apartments, or waiting 
rooms, for the ladies and gentlemen, the house¬ 
keeper’s room, and kitchen. At the further end of 
the lobby, is a hanging stair, which leads to the first 
flat above the basement story. After passing ano¬ 
ther lobby, you enter the Assembly Room, (extend¬ 
ing the whole length of the building,) which is 80 
feet in length, 35 in breadth, and 27 in height. On 
each end of the room are placed the musicians’ gal¬ 
leries, and on the north side, opposite the large Ve¬ 
netian side windows, are two marble chimney pieces. 

Between the windows are placed columns, and a 
number of fine emblematical figures, in the attitude 
of dancing. The ceiling is also ornamented with 
fancy work in the angles, which a large ellipse, 
drawn longitudinally, occasions. On this fiat, and 
in that immediately above, there are several other 
rooms, used as retiring apartments, to whicli two 
smaller staircases lead, from the first flight of the 
great staircase, as well as from the flat below. Upon 
the outside, the building has a very fine appear¬ 
ance, and was designed by the late Mr. J. Adam. 
It cost in building £4800. The wings, which were 
built in 1807 from designs by Mr. Henry Holland, 
are in unison with the main building, and connected 
to it by an ashler screen.

TIIE THEATRE 

is situated in Queen-street, opposite the south-west 
corner of George’s-square. It was erected, from de¬ 
signs by Mr. D. Hamilton, in 1801, by subscription- 
shares of £25 each, at an* expense of upwards of 
£ 18,500 for the building and scenery. The front 
is of polished work, and composed of an arcade base¬ 
ment supporting six Ionic columns, each thirty feet 
high, with corresponding pilasters, entablatures, and 
appropriate devices. Between the columns, which 
project from the wall their whole diameter, are two 
ranges of windows. The principal vestibule, which 
leads to the boxes by a double flight of stairs, is se¬ 
parated from the corridors by a screen interspersed 
with Corinthian columns, which gives the entrance 
a classic effect. The spectatory is elliptic, and dis¬ 
plays two tiers of boxes, slips, and galleries. The 
proscenium is SO feet wide, and decorated with an¬ 
tique ornaments. The stage-balconies are tastefully 
executed. The principal doors are in the front, and 
the whole building is massive and well constructed. 
It is the largest provincial theatre in Europe, and 
has been completed with much skill, judgment, and 
taste, and is inferior only to the best theatres of the 
metropolis. This building is 158 feet long, and 70 
feet wide. Its interior, which can accommodate 
1500 persons, or about £250 per night, when light¬ 
ed up presents a most brilliant and magnificent 
appearance. The standard-scenery, by Naismith, 
particularly the landscapes, are admirable; and the

is situated between John and Montrose streets. It 
was erected in 1788, from designs by Mr. John

each end. The wings project only three feet to¬ 
wards the street; the two staircases form an open

court behind. In the basement of each of these 
in front, are Venetian windows, divided by small 
Ionic columns. In the second story, are others of 
the same kind, in the plain style. Two rows of 
windows, upon a level with these, run along the 
main front, above which is a cornice through the 
wdiole length of the building. Above this, the 
wings rise another story, and terminate in pavilion 
roofs. In the centre of the ground flat is the Com¬ 
mon-hall, 70 feet long by 27 wide; and in the 
wings are six class-rooms, each 30 by 19 feet. The 
central part of the second flat is divided into two 
rooms, each 27 feet by 26, in length; so that the 
w hole building originally contained nine apartments. 
The low' room of the east wing has been added to 
the hall by removing the partition wall, the place 
of which is now supplied by two stone pillars. The 
entrance is through gateways at each end, by the 
court behind. More than half an acre of ground, 
behind the building, is appropriated for a play¬ 
ground to the scholars. 

Anteriorly to May 30th, 1815, four teachers con¬ 
ducted the business of education in this seminary, 
each of whom presided over a separate class. At 
that period, an act of the Magistrates and Council 
appointed the office of Rector, and extended the 
course of education to five years. One of the mas¬ 
ters alternately begins with the boys when they 
enter, and carries them through their successive ad¬ 
vances till the conclusion of the fourth year, when 
they are placed under the rector’s charge. They 





instruct their pupils in the Latin language: the 
rector, who possesses no control over his colleagues, 
besides the higher Latin classics, teaches the ele¬ 
ments of Greek and Geography, for which purpose 
he is furnished with a complete set of globes and 
maps. A committee of the Town-council, attended 
by four of the professors of the University and four 
of the clergymen of the city, visits the school eight 
times a year. The boys’ places are marked at each 
examination, and after the eighth, on October 1st, 
prizes of elegantly bound Latin books are conferred 
on those that stand highest, according to the average 
number, taken from the previous markings. These 
prizes generally amount to one hundred guineas 
annually, and are paid out of the town’s funds. The 
summer session begins early in April, when the 
hours ol attendance are, from 7 in the morning till 
9; from 10 till 12 ; and from 1 till 3, p. m. A va¬ 
cation of six weeks begins on the 4th of June. In 
the winter course, commencing in October, the hours 
are, from 9 till noon, and from 1 till 3, p. m. The 
rector’s salary, exclusive of fees, is LlOO per an¬ 
num, that of the master teaching the oldest class, 
£35 } and that of each of the others, £2 5. The fee 
to the rector’s class is 15s. and to the others 10s. 6d. 
per quarter, besides an expected gratuity at Candle¬ 
mas, 2s. 6d. for coals, and 2s. per annum to the ja¬ 
nitor. Each class is provided with a library of use¬ 
ful and entertaining books. On November 19 th, 
1816, a teacher of writing and arithmetic was added 
to this establishment. His classes meet in a room of

This Monument, being the first erected in this 
country, is situated in the Green, and is a lofty solid 
obelisk, 143 feet in height, including the pedestal. 
It was built at an expense of £2,075, raised by sub¬ 
scription, to commemorate the matchless naval vic¬ 
tories of Horatio, Lord Nelson, and is, at the same 
time, a proof of the patriotism of the citizens of 
Glasgow. On Friday, August 1, 1806, the anni¬ 
versary of the battle of Aboukir, the foundation of it 
was laid by Sir John Stuart of Allanbank, Bart, 
attended by the Office-bearers of the Grand Lodge, 
and in the presence of twenty-three Mason Lodges, 
the different public bodies of the city, and a con-

course of more than 80,000 spectators. After a grand 
procession to the site of the building from the High 
Church, where an appropriate sermon was preached 
by the Rev. Dr. Ritchie, with the usual masonic 
ceremonies the Grand Master laid the foundation- 
stone, in which was deposited a plate containing the 
following inscription:

area within. The chief front, facing the east, is 
divided into five compartments, with a portico in 
the centre. Two recesses, w T ith wings, are at each 
extremity. The portico is 58 feet in length, and 15 
from the plane of the wall. It is executed in the 
Grecian style of architecture, consisting of a double 
row of fluted columns, six in the front, and four with 
corresponding pilasters in the inner row. The co¬ 
lumns are set upon a flight of massy colossal steps, 
and the inner wall of the portico has five doors in 
the first story, leading into the courts; in the second 
are moulded pannels, corresponding with the open¬ 
ings below. The columns are covered by a massy 
and highly ornamented frize and cornice, with a 
pediment; in the tympanum of which are carved, 
in stone, the city arms and other emblematical de¬ 
vices, in bas-relief. The tw T o recesses on the sides 
of the portico are each 47 feet in length. These 
compartments are all plain work, except the centre 
window, which is decorated with a cornice and a 
pair of massy trusses. A plain Doric frize and cor¬ 
nice, with blocking course, finishes this part of the 
building. The two wings are each 31 feet in length, 
and ornamented by two pair of pilasters, coupled 
with fancy bases and capitals, and covered with a 
Doric frize and cornice, having channeled triglyphs 
and plain metops, over which rises a dado with 
moulded base and cope. The under window's of the 
wings are also decorated with a dressing, consisting 
of a pair of trusses and a pediment. The whole of 
this front is executed in polished, and, except the 




Despription of the Justiciary-hall, &amp;c. 




181 

inside of the portico, rusticated work. The Justi¬ 
ciary-hall is in the centre of the range, behind the 
portico, through the middle of which is the entry to 
it. This is a spacious apartment, and laid out with 
great taste. It is enlightened by seven very large 
windows on the west end, which is circular, of 30 
feet radius. In the east end is the Judges’ bench, 
appropriately decorated, and elevated considerably 
above the floor. On the right of this, are seats for 
the jurymen ; those for the magistrates are on the 
left. In a line with these, other seats are ranged all 
round the circle, the back of which forms a separa¬ 
tion from that part of the room appropriated to the 
use of the audience, which is more elevated. The 
interior of the circle is set apart for the reception of 
those connected with the court. The pannel’s box, 
into which he comes from the prison by a private 
passage, is situated in front of the Judges’ bench. 
The walls of the rooms are ornamented with columns 
of the Tonic order, with an appropriate frize and 
cornice. The ceilings are handsomely executed in 
stucco, corresponding with the whole. 

Immediately to the north of the hall of the Justi¬ 
ciary is that of the Borough-court, being a room of 
considerable dimensions, and furnished with a circu¬ 
lar bench for the Judges. Of the same size, and on 
the south of the hall, is situated the Council-cham¬ 
bers, arranged in the same order. The remainder 
of the ground floor of the front range is occupied 
by the clerks’ apartments for criminal business, and

rooms for the accommodation of the jurymen and 
witnesses during the circuit sessions. A door in the 
north, and another in the south front, lead, by two 
great staircases, to the second story of the public 
offices, which contains the lord provost’s room, and 
other apartments for transacting the public business. 
The south and north fronts are alike in every respect. 
The east and west wings are 24 feet in length, of 
polished rusticated work, corresponding with the 
principal front. The under windows are dressed in 
the same manner as those in the front wings. The 
centre is recessed, and executed in droved work, with 
polished plinth, sub-plinth, belt, frize, cornice, and 
blocking course, and dado over cornice, &amp;c. These 
windows are small, and formed with a polished mar¬ 
gin within the recesses, having iron gratings, by 
which they are secured. This gives the prison the 
appearance of great strength, without lessening its 
elegance. The east wings are connected with the 
public offices, and the west, together with the re¬ 
cessed parts, are constructed for the confinement of 
debtors. There are four stories in each part, divided 
into rooms about 10 feet square each, and having a 
fire-place, window, and conveniences for a bed, in 
each flight. That farthest to the west, being con¬ 
siderably larger than the rest, is -constructed into a 
public day-room, for social intercourse between the 
prisoners of that flat. In the south range there is 
a separate stair, by which female debtors may be 
lodged in the upper stories, without passing through 
the apartments occupied by the men. In each flat 





Felons’ and debtors’ apartments in the Jail. 


183 


there is a water closet, which tends much to the ac¬ 
commodation and cleanliness of the prisoners. 

The three principal fronts are constructed of a 
beautiful white stone, brought about five miles, from 
a quarry belonging to Sir Ilay Campbell. 

The west front is the most gloomy, having no 
openings except in the centre, which is a projecting 
compartment, having three recesses within each 
other. Two of these are arched. This compartment 
is executed in droved rustic work, and in it is the 
principal entrance for prisoners of every description. 
This front, likewise, has wings on the south and 
north ends, with recesses between them and the 
centre, and is built of plain solid work. This part 
of the prison is appropriated for the confinement of 
felons, and is neither lighted from, nor has any 
communication with the street. In the centre of 
this front, and on the ground flat, are situated the 
turnkey’s lodge, jailor’s writing office, guard-room, 
felons’ kitchen, &amp;c. From this there is a back jamb 
which, with a projection from the bow of the Justi¬ 
ciary-hall, divides the opening in the centre into two 
courts, to which the debtors from each front have 
occasional access. From these courts, the felons’ 
prison and the debtors’ galleries are lighted. On 
the underground story of the back jamb, are two 
cells for prisoners under sentence of death. These 
are entirely constructed of cast iron, and built round 
with a stone wall, through which the cell is lighted 
by a wdndow towards the court. As the prisoners 
are to be unfettered in these cells, there is a small

outer room, into which only those who are allowed to 
converse with them are admitted. This apartment, 
being separated from each cell by an open grated 
door of longer dimensions, through it the conversa¬ 
tion must, at all times, be carried on. In this room 
is a fire-place. Over it, and extending towards the 
front, in the second story, is the jailor’s dwelling 
house, all the windows of which look either into the 
south or north court, except those of the kitchen, 
which are toward the west. The entrance to this 
dwelling house and the apartments above it, is from 
the west, by a separate stair. The flat immediately 
above, and of the same dimensions, is converted into 
an hospital for the sick; and the flat above that, is 
a chapel for worship. Both the flats are principally 
lighted from the courts. The whole of these apart¬ 
ments occupy all the centre compartments of the 
west range, with the back jamb. In the remainder 
of this range, on the right and left of the centre, are 
constructed the prisons destined for felons, composed 
of cells of equal dimensions, strongly divided by stone 
parapet walls. They are also arched and paved with 
stone, and cramped with lead and iron. Each of the 
flats, having a passage and day-room for air and ex¬ 
ercise, is likewise furnished with a water-closet, and 
the four stories can either communicate with each 
other, or be separately enclosed as necessity may re¬ 
quire. Drains are constructed in the court-yards, 
and by these the water from the roof, courts, and 
water-closets, is carried into the Clyde, by the Mo- 
lendinar-bourn, over which is an arch formed into a 
street, within a few feet of the prison walls. All the

ground floor of the prison is strongly arched, which 
not only adds to its strength, but is the means of 
keeping it dry and comfortable. 

The situation of this stately edifice is well chosen, 
and the arrangements judiciously made for the pur¬ 
poses to which it is designed. It is much more 
healthful and airy than most buildings of the kind, 
in being separated from all other houses by streets. 
These are, a continuation of Ctyde-street along the 
river, a street formed on the arch of the Molendinar- 
bourn on the west, the opening which terminates in 
St. Mungo’s-lane on the north, and the Saltmarket, 
stretching to the Clyde, dividing it from the Green 
in front. In its construction, much attention has 
been paid to the health and comfort of the unfortu¬ 
nate; and, while it is to be lamented that the crimes 
of men render such a structure necessary, it is at the 
same time agreeable to reflect that, in promoting 
security, humanity has not been overlooked. 

The superintendence of building the Jail was 
entrusted to Mr. James Cleland, whose zealous ex¬ 
ertions on the public account have been eminently 
conspicuous on many occasions. From his judicious 
suggestions, the cells for the reception of criminals 
under sentence of death, were constructed. In 
these, the w r retch who had hitherto pined in irons, 
and under a restricted use of his limbs, may now, 
even in his dreary cell, employ them with freedom 
in acts of exercise and devotion. Mr. Cleland also, 
before the final arrangements had been adjusted, 
visited, at his own expense, the principal jails in

useful hints. On this occasion he had the honour 
of advice and assistance from James Neild, Esq. of 
Stoke-Hammond, Bucks, the Howard of the present 
day. 

This structure, the erection of which cost £.34,811, 
exclusive of the ground, was defrayed from the funds 
of the Corporation, and built by Messrs. Waddell 
and Park, masons in Glasgow, under the immediate 
management of Mr. Mathew Park, of whose abilities 
and professional knowledge, it is hoped it will long 
remain a splendid monument. On Tuesday, Septem¬ 
ber 18th, 1810, the Lord Provost laid the founda¬ 
tion-stone ; within which were deposited specimens 
of the gold, silver, and copper coins of his present 
Majesty, the newspapers of the day, and a plate on 
which were engraved the names of the gentlemen of 
the magistracy and council, and this inscription:

Guard-house and Police-office.—Bridewell. 187 


THE GUARD-HOUSE AND POLICE-OFFICE. 

The former, erected in 1810, is a plain conveni¬ 
ent building, situated on the east side of the foot 
of Montrose-street; the latter was removed in the 
same year to the foot of South Albion-street, near 
its junction with Bell-street. 

THE BRIDEWELL 

was erected in 1799, on the north side of Duke- 
street, nearly where it crosses the Molendinar-bourn. 
It is six stories in height, and 106 feet long, by SO 
in width, with projecting wings. A passage, with 
two large windows at the ends, divides each flat, in 
which are 21 cells, 8 feet by 7 in length, exclusive 
of a chapel * and large work-room. The door is in 
the centre of the front, and conducts to a large stair 
which connects the passages. The wings are three 
stories high, and are occupied by the keepers, and 
as warehouses. The prisoners are lodged in separate 
cells, and employed in such labour as they can per¬ 
form, under the inspection of the keeper, who takes 
an exact account of their earnings. After defraying 
the expenses of their maintenance, the surplus is paid 
to each at the expiration of their confinement, when 
the sum of £10 has been known to be received by 
some of the more industrious. The members of the

Town-Council visit, and report upon the state of the 
Bridewell. This building is enclosed with a high 
wall. 

THE BARRACKS 

are situated at the north side, and towards the east¬ 
ern extremity of the Gallowgate. They were erected 
in 1795, and, with the extensive area, occupy about 
3\ acres of ground, enclosed by a lofty wall. They 
consist of three compartments fronting the south, two 
of which are built at right angles to the third. The 
middle is four stories in height, having the Royal 
Arms in demi-relief within a pediment in the centre 
of the building, in which are apartments for the of¬ 
ficers, the mess-room, and public parlours. The side 
buildings are divided into seventy-two rooms, each 
of which contains fourteen men. A kitchen, on the 
ground flat, is appropriated to the use of every three 
rooms. Behind the barracks is built a neat well 
aired hospital, and apartments for the use of the sick 
soldiery. 

MARKETS IN KING-STREET. 

That on the east side of the street, being the one 
for beef, is 112 feet, by 67 , in length. In its centre 
is a gate, on each side of which are two Ionic co¬ 
lumns supporting a pediment. Upon the other end 
is a hall where the Incorporation of Butchers meets 
to transact business. On the opposite side are the 
mutton and fish markets, with a front of 173 feet, 
by 46, in length. In the centre of the former is a

gate, adorned by Ionic columns, with a Doric por¬ 
tico. Two other doors are arched at the top, and 
faced with rusticated work. The whole is paved, 
and covered with roofs, supported by stone piers. 
In each area is a well, by which it is always kept 
clean. Much taste is displayed in the execution of 
the Fish market. In Bell-street is another Flesh 
market: the ground which the whole markets oc¬ 
cupy is about 2,500 square yards. * 

THE GREEN MARKET. 

The site of this market, which was formerly in 
the Candleriggs, is now occupied by a handsome 
range of buildings. It is now removed to the New 
Wynd, to the ground on which the Wynd Church 
stood, and is laid out in a compact and neat manner. 

THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE 

was constructed in 1810, and stands a little south 
from the Bridgegate, and covers 4,736 square yards 
of ground. It contains seventy-seven separate kil¬ 
ling-rooms, two cattle-yards, and two alleys, with 
accommodation for the searchers and scavengers.

is conveyed, in pipes, through all the killing-rooms, 
and every nuisance is removed, by means of exten¬ 
sive sewers, into the river. * 

THE BAZAR 

is a market for general stores, situated on the east 
side of Candlerigg-street, formerly a Bowling-green, 
and occupies a space of 2377 square yards, formed 
into two divisions. In one of these the weekly mar¬ 
ket is held; where accommodation, free of expense, 
is provided for the country people under an arcade. 
The other is formed into 36 Bazar-shops, fronting 
alleys, where purchasers walk under cover. These 
alleys and markets are all paved and supplied with 
water, and every thing offensive is removed by drains 
into the nearest common sewer. The building was 
designed by Mr. James Cleland, and has a very neat 
ashler front. The Bazar-shops let from J6l0 to j£ 14- 
per year. 

THE OLD BRIDGE 

was originally constructed of wood. The present 
one, built of hewn stone, was founded in 1345, by 


* Hitherto the cattle brought to the Glasgow markets for sale, have been 
exposed on one of the public streets, to the inconvenience of the buyers 
and sellers, and the endangerment of the inhabitants. This nuisance is soon 
to be removed: at the east end of the Gallowgate, in Graham’s-square, a 
piece of ground, containing about 9000 yards, has been laid off for a cattle 
market. It is surrounded with a stone wall, paved, and fitted up with pens 
for holding the sheep and cattle: large sheds are provided for the cattle not 
sold on the market day. A small duty is exacted for each head of cattle. 
Attached to the market is a public-house, for the accommodation of the 
farmers and the clerk of the market. 







The New Bridge. 




191 


William Rae bishop of Glasgow. It stretches across 
the Clyde from the lower extremity of Stockwell- 
street, to the village of Gorbals, and consists of ten 
arches, two of which have been built up. The south 
arch fell, on July 7th, 1671; “ the very day of Glas¬ 
gow Fair,” says M f Ure, in his History of Glasgow, 
“ and about 12 of the clock; and though hundreds, 
yea, I may say thousands, had passed and repassed, 
on horse and foot, yet not a single person got the 
least harm.” An addition was made to its width, in 
1777, by adding 10 feet to its eastern side: it is now 
415 feet long, and 22 wide within the parapets. The 
middle arch of the bridge was built at the expense 
of Lady Lochow, she having asked it as a favour 
from the bishop, that he would allow her to assist in 
this public-spirited undertaking. Above this arch, 
her bust was formerly placed. 


THE NEW BRIDGE 

crosses the Clyde from Jamaica-street, to Tradestown 
on the south. It was founded in 1767, and finished 
at an expense little less than £g000. It consists of 
seven arches, rising upon piers with angular points, 
and extends 500 feet in length, and 30 wide within 
the parapets, having a paved footpath on each side. 
Directly over the centre of each pier, is a circular 
arch, which relieves the action of the water against 
the work, when the river swells, and gives an air of 
lightness and elegance to the bridge. Immediately 
above, is an entablature, with a fret parapet. The 
work was completed from plans by Mr. Miln, the

architect who designed Blackfriars’-bridge, London, 
and executed by Mr. John Adam, builder in this 
city. 

THE WOODEN BRIDGE 

was built in 1803, after a design by Mr. Peter Ni¬ 
cholson, at the expense of £1200, and maintains 
communication between the foot of Saltmarket-street 
and Hutchesontown. It is formed by one arch, 340 
feet in span, with eight supports and break-waters. 
Its breadth, within the parapets, which are formed 
of upright spars with diagonal braces, is seven feet 
four inches. This bridge is constructed solely for 
the accommodation of foot passengers, from each of 
whom a pontage of one halfpenny is levied on the 
Sundays. * 

THE POST-OFFICE 

is a new building, situated in Nelson-street. It has 
an ashler front, relieved in the centre, and terminating 
in a pediment. The apartments are well laid out for 
dispatch of business; and, for the accommodation of 
the public, there is also a large lobby to wait in, un¬ 
til the letters are delivered to those who are in the 
practice of calling for them; and where, also, paid 
letters are taken in. 


* In 1814, the magistrates and council of Glasgow, with some of the 
feuers in Hutchesontown, obtained an Act of Parliament for building a new 
stone bridge over the river, a little below this one. The design is by Mr. 
John Rennie. The expense will amount to nearly £20,000. 





The Weigh-housc.—The Bonding Warehouses. 


195 


THE WEIGH-HOUSE 

is situated on the north side of the east end of Ing¬ 
ram-street, adjacent to the Ram’s-horn church. It is 
of a square form, with a pavilion roof, and adorned at 
the angles and sides of the doors with Ionic pilasters. 
Goods are warehoused in it, on payment of a small 
sum as storage. Duties on certain commodities are 
levied here; and it is also much frequented by car¬ 
riers for the purpose of loading and delivering, and 
of ascertaining the weight of the different articles. 

BONDING WAREHOUSES. 

It has long been an object of importance to the 
merchants and traders in this commercial city, that 
a place should be appropriated for the depositing of 
goods, in security of his Majesty’s duties. Much 
delay and inconvenience were occasioned by the 
distance to transport the goods from the Bonding 
Warehouses in Greenock and Port-Glasgow, to this 
city. In March 1818, Bonding Warehouses were 
therefore erected in Howard-street. The buildings 
are substantial and commodious: they consist of four 
stories, terminating with a handsome belfry, which 
contains a clock. Their appearance bespeak the 
purposes to which they are applied, and the plan 
and arrangement reflect credit on Mr. W. Reid, the 
architect. 






194 Lock Hospital.—Botanic Garden. 





THE LOCK HOSPITAL 

is situated in the Rottenrow, and so completely 
enclosed that the inmates cannot see beyond the 
court-yards. Convenient apartments are fitted up 
for the committee, housekeeper, and surgeon. This 
charitable institution, built in 1808, is supported by 
private subscription. Its object is, by the contri¬ 
bution of medical and other assistance, to alleviate 
the sufferings of unfortunate females, whom their 
licentious lives may have subjected to the miseries 
ever attending the practice of vice. At the same 
time, by lessons of virtue, and habits of industry, 
such an impression is attempted to be made on these 
unhappy beings as may have a salutary influence on 
their minds and future conduct, 

BOTANIC GARDEN. 

“ Hither emerging from yon orient skies, . 

Botanic Goddess, bend thy radiant eyes; 

O’er these soft scenes assume thy gentle reign, 

Pomona, Ceres, Flora, in thy train; 

Obedient sails from realms afar will bring 
For thee, the unnamed progeny of Spring, 

And in one point, admiring Nature find. 

The fruits and leaves of every curious kind.” 

BARWIN. 

In 1817* the Glasgow Botanic Garden was insti¬ 
tuted. The funds required for its establishment 
w r ere raised by subscription, in transferable shares 
of ten guineas each, and by a contribution of ,£2000 
from the Faculty of the College of Glasgow; for 
this liberal donation, the Professor of Botany has the

exclusive right of lecturing at the garden, and the 
college of annually returning three of their number 
as directors of the institution. 

The garden is situated to the west of the city, 
between the Sandyford and Dunbarton roads, and 
distant about 1^ miles from the Cross. It consists 
of nearly Scotch, or 8^ English acres, held in feu 
from Archibald Campbell, Esq. of Blythswood, and 
is completely surrounded with a stone wall, having 
an entrance from each of the two roads lying on its 
north and south sides. 

The garden is divided by gravel walks into several 
irregular compartments, which are intended to com¬ 
prise, besides a general arrangement of herbaceous 
plants, collections of British, American, medical, and 
esculent plants; together with those used in agricul¬ 
ture and the arts, and two collections for the use of 
students—one arranged after the system of Linnaeus, 
and the other after that of Jussieu, now generally 
adopted on the continent. The trees and shrubs are 
not arranged after any particular system, but are 
scattered or groved together in various parts of the 
garden. A small pond, with stone compartments, 
contains the aquatic plants, and is partly surrounded 
with a handsome artificial rock, the stones composing 
which were brought from a considerable distance. 
Near the centre of the garden is placed a large and 
commodious green-house, and two stoves, one of 
which contains a cistern for aquatic plants: and a 
circular health-house and conservatory, which it is 
intended at a future time to erect at the ends of the

stove, will complete the range. Behind the houses, 
and concealed by a sloping bank of planting, are the 
forcing-pots, hotbeds, sheds, and furnaces, with a 
room for the accommodation of workmen. Near the 
principal entry to the north stands a neat lodge, with 
a verandole, the under part of which, entered from 
the front, is occupied by die curator of the garden; 
and the upper part, consisting of one large room, and 
entered by an outside stair, is appropriated to the 
use of the proprietors, and as a lecture room, and one 
side of it is intended to be fitted up as a library, and 
for the reception of Hortus Siccus. 

The management is vested in a president, vice- 
president, and nine directors, three of whom go out 
in rotation, and three new ones are annually elected 
in their place. The election nf managers takes place 
on the second Monday of December. 





itoltttcal Constitution 

OF THE CITY. 


Various alterations made in the Set of the city. 

SINCE the first erection of Glasgow into a Royal 
Burgh, several alterations in the Set of the city 
have been made. William and Mary, in 1691, by 
their charter, empowered the magistrates and coun¬ 
cil to elect the Provost, and conferred powers of 
choosing all other officers, as fully and freely as the 
city of Edinburgh , or any other Royal Burgh . The 
form and manner of this election by the Town- 
Council, has since varied according to the different 
constitutions adopted at subsequent periods. In 
1711 * the original set underwent some alterations; 
and, in 1748, another was adopted, and afterwards 
confirmed, upon a petition from the magistrates and 
council, in 1801, to the convention of royal burghs, 
and is now declared to be as follows. The af¬ 
fairs of the Burgh shall be governed by a Provost, 
three Baillies of the Merchants’ Rank, and two 
Baillies of the Trades’ Rank, and twelve Counsel¬ 
lors of the Merchants’ Rank, and eleven Counsellors 
of the Trades’ Rank; a Master of Works, who must 
be of the Merchants’ rank; and a Treasurer of the 
Merchants’ and Trades’ Rank, alternately. These

two Officers are Counsellors, ex ejficiis. The offices 
of the Gorbals Baillie, and the Baiilie and Depute- 
Baillie of the River, do not add to the number of 
Counsellors; and like the Treasurer, are chosen 
from each of the ranks alternately. The Dean of 
Guild and Convener of the Trades’ House, are 
Counsellors, ex officiis, during the first year they are 
in office; after which, they must be elected or¬ 
dinary Counsellors. On the first Tuesday which 
shall happen after the 29th of September, (Michael¬ 
mas day,) the whole Council being summoned, are 
put into leets or lists, from whom they elect the 
Provost and Baillies; and on the Friday thereafter, 
the newly elected Provost and Baillies, and the two 
preceding sets of Magistrates meet and disqualify 
the two senior Merchants’ and Trades’ Counsellors, 
and elect others in their place. The Lord Pro¬ 
vost (who from courtesy is styled Honourable) and 
the five Baillies are charged with the executive, while 
the Magistrates and Council conduct the other public 
affairs of the community. To this great body belongs 
a vote in the election of a member to represent the 
citizens in Parliament. The present representative is 
Kirkman Finlay, Esq. This important privilege, 
however, they only enjoy in common with the burghs 
of Renfrew, Rutlierglen, and Dunbarton, which have 
equal shares with the city of Glasgow. 

The revenue of the burgh arises chiefly from an 
impost of two pennies Scots on the Scottish pint of 
ale or beer, brewed, or sold within the city; ladies 
and multures, which are certain dues on grain, meal, 
fruit, and similar articles; dues on cattle killed with- 





Revenue and expenditure of the burgh.

in the burgh ; dues from the washing-house and 
tron; rents of markets, church seats, houses, milns, 
and miln lands; burgess entries, feus of land, and 
ground-annuals. Its expenditure is induced by the 
burgh assessment, criminal prosecutions, alimenting 
criminal prisoners, expense of the jail and bridewell, 
expense of civil, ecclesiastical, and police establish¬ 
ments, ministers’ stipends, officers’ salaries, repairs 
of heritable property, and general improvements. 

By the original as well as present constitution of 
the city, the civil establishment of Glasgow con¬ 
sists of three different bodies; the Magistrates with 
the Town-Council; the Merchants’ House; and the 
Trades’ House. 

By the addition to the charter of the burgh, in 
1801, it is provided that every person who shall be 
elected into any one of the offices of Provost, Baillie, 
Dean of Guild, or Deacon Convener, shall, on his 
refusing to accept, at the first meeting of Council 
after the election of the Dean of Guild, be fined in 
the sum of eighty pounds sterling; and also that every 
Counsellor nominated, and declining to accept, shall 
be fined, within three months after the election, in 
the sum of forty pounds sterling. The fines so in¬ 
curred, are to be levied for the behoof of the poor 
of the Merchants’ and Trades’ Houses respectively, 
according to the rank of the refusing member. 

By King James’s charter, in 1450, the bishop and 
his successors held the city as a burgh of regality, 
by paying yearly upon St. John’s day a red rose, if 
the same should be asked. These ecclesiastics, to 





i&gt;00 Present Magistrates and Counsellors. 

awe the inhabitants, appointed powerful nobles as 
baillies. The Lennox family long held this office, 
and, in 1621 , acquired an absolute right to it from 
the Archbishop. The Duke of Lennox at length 
resigned it to the crown, which, till 1748, appointed 
the Baillies of regality. At present, the executive 
government is vested in the magistracy, and the 
public interest in the Town-council. The gentle¬ 
men who now compose this municipal body are,

Constitution of the Merchants' House. 


201 


MERCHANTS’ HOUSE. 

It is not till the beginning of the seventeenth 
century, that any authentic record can be found of 
the existence of a mercantile incorporation in this 
city, though commercial pursuits had long previously 
occupied the attention of its citizens. The first in¬ 
stitution of the present Merchants’ House, originated 
in a dispute between the Merchants’ and Trades* 
ranks, regarding the government of the city. The 
merchants had exercised the whole sway, monopo¬ 
lised the magistracy, and assumed the sole right 
of managing the funds; precedence and superiority 
of this sort provoked the animosities of the Trades, 
who were more numerous, and they insisted on a 
participation of office. The contest was determined 
by a mutual submission of the points of difference to 
Sir George Elphinston, then provost, the parson of 
Glasgow, and two ministers of the city, “ anent their 
privileges, places, ranks, and prerogatives.” The 
award of these arbitrators is termed the Letter of Guil - 
dry, is dated 6th February, 1605, and contains the 
original constitution of the Merchants’ House. This 
decreet arbitral was approved and ratified by the 
magistrates and council, on the 9th February, 1605, 
and &gt;vas afterwards confirmed by Act of Parliament, 
Charles II. on the 11th September, 1672. 

The members of this respectable body are divided 
into two classes—foreign and home traders. The 
incorporation acts in three capacities—as an elective 
body, a charitable association, and a deliberative as-

sembly. The Dean of Guild presides over this bo¬ 
dy : he is chosen from among the members, and 
continues in office for two years ; this officer with 
his council, consisting of thirty-six of the members, 
together with the Lord Provost, Merchant Baillies 
and the Collector, represent the community, and 
manage the concerns of the Merchants’ House. 

Part of the money mortified to the House, and 
from which its fixed revenue arises, is left to the free 
disposal of the members, while in other cases they are 
tied down and restricted, in the application of the 
funds, to certain rules and regulations prescribed 
by the donors. The capital in 1818 consisted of 
£24,572 : 11 : 6 sterling; and the expenditure of 
last year among the poor of the hospital and contin¬ 
gent charity, amounted to the sum of £1200 10 1. 

Every person who settles in this city as a merchant 
or trader, must immediately enter with the Dean of 
Guild, by paying according to his situation, if a 
stranger or otherwise, one of the following sums, for 
which he is admitted a burgess and guild-brother. 

If he be a stranger merchant,-8 0 

If he be a stranger tradesman,---8 0 

If he be the eldest son of a burgess, his father alive, ~1 9 6 

If he be the eldest son of a burgess, his father dead, 110 
If he be the younger son of a burgess, whether his 

father is living or dead,--— -~~-„—1 12 0 

If he be married to the daughter of a burgess„~~~l 15 0 
If he have served an apprenticeship,~~~~- ^.1 1 6 0 

Having paid one of these sums, and not less than 
a guinea to the gold book, he is furnished with a

203 


burgess ticket, upon producing which, to the clerk 
of the Merchants’ House, and paying ten guineas, he 
is enrolled a matriculated member. Independently 
of these sums, the entering member is required to 
pay the stamp. 

THE TRADES’ HOUSE, 

which forms the third member of the political body 
of the city, is composed of representatives from each 
of the fourteen incorporated trades, together with a 
president, who is called the Deacon Convener, a 
Collector, and Clerk, &amp;c. besides extraordinary mem¬ 
bers, which, however, are never more than three in 
number. 

The Deacon Convener and Collector make up the 
ordinary members of the Trades’ House, amounting 
in all to fifty-six. The extraordinary members are 
the Trades’ Baillie, while in office, the Deacon Con¬ 
vener and Collector, if chosen out of the last nine 
trades during the time they are in office, and for 
two years after they go out. In this case, the total 
members are fifty-nine, but if the Convener and 
Collector are chosen out of the first five trades, it 
makes no alteration in the members of the house, 
the number in that case being fifty-six. Upon the 
first Wednesday after the election of the Town- 
council, the Deacon Convener is chosen. 

The revenue of this body politic arises partly from 
heritable property, from freedom-fines paid by those 
of the trades’ rank, and partly from sums mortified 
to the house. Their funds are placed under the 




20-1 


Stock of the Trades’ House. 


management of the Convener, Trades’ Baillies, Col¬ 
lector, and the ordinary and extraordinary members 
of the house. Their stock at present, 1818, amounts 
to upwards of £ 16,333. Last year they paid in inci¬ 
dental expenses, and to twenty-seven poor members 
from the different incorporations, who are termed the 
hospital poor, the sum of J07O8 : 4. 

The fourteen incorporations, with the Merchants* 
House, are the only chartered societies that have a 
share in the government of the city, and from whom 
the Counsellors, and, consequently, the Magistrates 
are elected. The other citizens, however, individu¬ 
ally, are not debarred from having a voice in, or a 
share of, the government, because each of them may, 
by becoming a member of the one rank or the other, 
acquire every privilege which either enjoys. The 
charter of the city of Glasgow is now therefore upon 
as liberal a plan as any in the kingdom, and as well 
calculated to promote the interests, and equalize the 
rights of government, among the citizens. 

Each of the Incorporations has a Deacon, except 
the Maltmen, who have a Visitor and Collector, with 
a certain number of Masters. These, with the Mem¬ 
bers in the Trades’ House from each Incorporation, 
together with the fee of admission, and expenditure 
to the poor, are exhibited in the following table.

Circuit-court.—Sheriff-court. 


Courts of fustier. 

THE CIRCUIT-COURT 

meets twice a year, in April and in September. It 
is attended generally by two Judges, the Sheriffs of 
Lanark, Renfrew, and Dunbarton, and by the lord 
provost and magistrates of the city. Before it are 
tried all criminal cases, -which are competent to the 
Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh, excepting the 
crime of high treason. The judges give judgment 
in civil matters, in appeals from inferior Courts of 
Record, where the sum does not exceed £25; when 
above that sum, the sentence must be acquiesced in, 
or the cause advocated to the Court of Session. 

SHERIFF-COURT. 

There are two sessions in the year of this court. 
The first commences on the 12th of May, and rises 
on the 12th of July; the other ©n the 12th of No¬ 
vember, and ends on the 12th of March. It meets 
upon Wednesday every -week during these periods. 
Persons tried before this court for capital or corporeal 
punishment, or banishment from the country, must 
be tried by a jury of fifteen persons. 

All civil actions may be tried by it, except a few 
peculiar to the Court of Session. The Sheriff also 
possesses a -high criminal jurisdiction, and has the 
power of punishing capitally; but the exercise of his

authority in felonious concerns, is chiefly confined in 
practice to matters of theft, and other crimes of a 
lesser moment. His sentences are, however, subject 
to the review of the Courts of Session and Justiciary. 

COMMISSARY-COURTS 
OF GLASGOW, HAMILTON, AND CAMPSIE. 

These are held in this city. Their jurisdiction is 
so very extensive as to reach over great part of the 
shires of Renfrew, Stirling, Dunbarton, and Ayr, 
besides Lanarkshire. They were constituted during 
the reign of James I.; and were formerly held, by 
the bishop, in the consistory-house, adjoining the 
cathedral. They meet upon the Thursdays, during 
the session, in the ordinary Court-hall. The Com¬ 
missary, like the Sheriff-Depute, is appointed by the 
crown. Civil actions for debt may be also decided 
in this court, to the extent of £40 Scots , or £3: 6: 8 
sterling. 

BAILLIE, OR TOWN-COURT. 

This is of very ancient date, having been instituted 
as early as the erection of the town into a royal burgh. 
The Magistrates officiate, in rotation, as judges; and 
the procedure is conducted in writing, and under the 
superintendence of legal assessors. 

The procedure is either of an ordinary, or of a 
summary nature. For the decision of ordinary civil 
cases, the court is held at regular intervals, and for 
the discussion of those which require extraordinary 
despatch, the court is open every lawful day; and 




208 The Dean of Guild-court. 

the proceedings take place without any stated diets. 
No claim is received or enforced by this court, 
unless it exceed thirty shillings sterling in value; 
and in those of a criminal nature, the magistrates 
are authorized to decide, and to order punishment 
according to the nature of offence, by imprisonment, 
stripes, pillory, or banishment from the burgh: they 
can, however, judge in no capital causes, or such as 
may affect loss of limb. 

The court is held at the Public Offices, on Friday, 
at 11 o’clock a. m., once every week during the ses¬ 
sion, and, at least, once every month during the 
vacation of the Court of Session. 

DEAN OF GUILD-COURT. 

The Dean of Guild, assisted by a council of eight, 
one half merchants, the other tradesmen, is the judge 
in this court. His business is to determine disputes 
between conterminous proprietors; to adjust and re¬ 
gulate the weights and measures; to take care that 
buildings within the city be carried on according 
to law ; that encroachments be not made upon the 
public streets; to consider the state of buildings, 
whether they be in such a condition as to threaten 
damage to those dwelling in them, or to the neigh¬ 
bourhood ; and to grant warrants for repairing, 
pulling down, or rebuilding them, according to the 
circumstances of the case. 

Parties and their Procurators are occasionally 
heard viva voce; but the principal part of the pro¬ 
cess is conducted in writing; and when it appears 





Justice of Peace-court—Court of Conscience—Maritime-court. 209 

necessary, the court has recourse to the advice of its 
legal assessors. The court is held once a fortnight, 
on Thursday, at 11 a. m., throughout the year, in 
the Burgh-court-hall, for despatch of ordinary busi¬ 
ness; but when an urgent case occurs, a court is 
called on the special application of parties. 

JUSTICE OF PEACE-COURT. 

The gentlemen who hold the office of Justice of 
Peace for the nether ward of Lanarkshire, are the 
proper judges in this court. All actions for debt, 
to the amount of £5 sterling, are here competent; 
also, all such as have for their conclusion, the fines 
or penalties to any amount, that may have been in¬ 
curred by illegal traffic, or by offences against the 
revenue, &amp;c. This court meets in the Circuit-court-

SYSTEM OF POLICE. 

By an Act of Parliament, passed in 1800, but 
altered and amended in 1807, the management of 
the Police is vested in the Lord Provost, five Baillies, 
Dean of Guild, Deacon Convener, and twenty-four 
Commissioners, one from each of the wards into 
which the city is divided. These commissioners are 
elected on the last Monday of July, annually, when 
the eight senior members go out of office, and their 
place is supplied by re-election, or the appointment 
of others, whose names are added to the bottom of 
the list. They are chosen by the majority of votes, 
in each ward, of those who occupy dwelling-houses, 
shops, warehouses, or other buildings valued at &lt;£l0 
or upwards, of yearly rent. The votes are given on 
written tickets, deposited in boxes placed in certain 
shops within the respective wards. By the present 
act, all houses, warehouses, shops, and other build¬ 
ings, may be assessed in the following sums, but not 
in higher: viz. those valued at four pounds, and un¬ 
der six pounds, fivepence in the pound; six pounds, 
and under ten pounds, sevenpence halfpenny; ten 
pounds, and under fifteen pounds, elevenpence far¬ 
thing ; all above fifteen pounds, one shilling and 
threepence. * Innkeepers, whatever may be the rent 


* The commissioners, by the act, have it in their power to levy Is. 3d. 
per pound on the highest scale of rents; but this establishment has been 
managed with such rigid economy and judicious propriety, that the highest 
rate never exceeded Is. per pound. 





Police rates of assessment. 211 

of their property, cannot be assessed in more than 
ten pounds. Houses, shops, &amp;c. under four pounds, 
are not subject to Police duty. 

The object of the Police is to see that order and 
peace be preserved, to direct the cleaning of the 
•streets, the ranging of the lamps, and the conduct 
of every thing connected with the security, comfort, 
cleanliness, and decoration of the city. The assess¬ 
ment, * for the year 1818, is as follows: 

Rent at £4, and under £6,~~~~~4d. per pound. 

Do. at £6, —~~~~~— £10,-6d. per do. 

Do. at £10,- £15,~~~~~9d. per do. 

Do. at £15, and upwards,--.Is. per do. 

The commissioners hold their meetings once in 
the quarter, on the last Mondays of February, May, 
August, and November. Extraordinary meetings 
may, however, be called at any time by the Lord 
Provost, or in his absence by the senior magistrate, 
upon the requisition of any four of the commission¬ 
ers. The assessment, to be levied for the ensuing 
year, is ascertained on the last Monday of August, 
and the accounts of the funds are regularly balanced, 
and a statement of the payments and disbursements 
for the preceding year, is made out and printed, on 
the last Monday of July. A copy of this is delivered 
to each of the commissioners, and the members of 
the Town-council, Merchants’ and Trades* Houses, 
and for the inspection of the burgesses and such as 


* The assessment is made on the aggregate rent; namely, if a person 
possesses a shop at £5, and a house at £10, he is charged at the highest as¬ 
sessment upon £15 of rent. 








212 Police office-bearers and assistants, &amp;c. 

contribute to the assessment. The book, to which 
they have free access, lies open during six weeks in 
the Council-chamber. In addition to the sum raised 
by assessment, the magistrates and council are bound 
to pay, annually, to the establishment, not less than 
&lt;£800, from the funds of the community, by half 
yearly payments, at Martinmas and Whitsunday. 
To carry into effect the intentions of the Police, the 
following office-bearers and assistants are appointed: 

Master of Police, James Mitchell, with a salary of £280. 

Collector and Treasurer, Joshua Heywood,-- 200. 

Clerk, James Todd, —,---„-- 100. 

Surveyor, J. Gardner,---- 60. 

There are besides three constables, twelve officers, 
and four inferior officers, who are paid from 18s. to 
20s. per week; twenty of patrol, and seventy-eight 
watchmen, who receive from 11s. to 12s. per week; 
and seventeen scavengers, who likewise receive 11s. 
per week. 

The watchmen are on their stations at 10 o’clock 
at night, during the whole year, and so continue 
until 5 in the morning in the months of May, June, 
July, and August; till 6 in the months of March, 
April, September, and October; and till 7 in the 
months of November, December, January, and Feb¬ 
ruary. A constable with six officers attend in rota¬ 
tion, at the office, Albion-street, half an hour before 
the watchmen take their stations, to call the roll. 
The officers thereafter patrole the streets; and the 
twenty of patrole observe if the watchmen are doing 
their duty, apprehend vagrants, suspicious and dis-

orderly persons, and observe if the lamps are burning 
properly. A regular report of the whole is entered 
in a book, by the constable of the night, for the in¬ 
spection of a magistrate and the Master of Police in 
the morning, and the commissioners at the weekly 
Board. 

Since the establishment of the Police, the city has 
become remarkable for its cleanliness, and the order 
preserved in it. Much regularity is now conspicuous 
on all public occasions; such as the weekly market 
days, held on the Mondays, Wednesdays, and Satur¬ 
days, and also during the great annual fairs, which 
are those of Whitsun-monday, Glasgow Fair in July, 
St. Mungo’s on the 25th December, or Yule , and on 
the Thursday before Easter, called Skyer s Thursday. 
Innumerable improvements have also been made in 
almost every corner of the city, especially in the 
paving and lighting of the streets, * and the con¬ 
struction of public sewers, executed on a suitable 
and extended scale. In the winter season there are, 
generally, about 1400 lamps lighted every night. 
The following is a state of the funds: 

The Receipts ending July 1816, were £10,649 11 0£ 

Disbursements to that period,-- 9,6 97 16 6§

* Previous to April 1817, the streets were watered in dry and sultry 
weather with watering-canns; but in that month, a fire-engine butt, placed 
on a cart, having a copper pipe perforated with holes projecting from the 
end, was first used, and completely answers its purpose. It is drawn by one 
horse, and is capable of watering more of the streets than thirty-two sca¬ 
vengers can sweep.

Account of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons. 

IN Glasgow, as in other great cities, utility unites 
men into different societies, either for the improve¬ 
ment of the mind, for their pleasure, for the increase 
of knowledge, or for the good of mankind. 

FACULTY OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS. 

The Physicians and Surgeons were first formed 
into a corporate body, by a charter from James VI. 
in 1 599&gt; upon an application of Peter Low, * surgeon 


* The monument of this gentleman “of facetious memory,” is still 
preserved on the south side of the High Church-yard, and contains this 
inscription: 

“ Stay passenger and view this stone; 

For under it, lies such a One, 

Who cured many, while he liv’d; 

So gracious he no man griev’d; 

Yea, when his Physic’s Force oft fail’d 
His pleasant purpose then prevail’d: 

For of his God, he got the Grace, 

To live in Mirth and die in Peace. 

Heavens have his soul, his Corpse this stone: 

Sigh Passenger, and then begone. 

Ah me! I Gravel am and dust, 

And to the earth return I must; 

O painted piece of living clay, 

Man, be not proud of thy short day.” 







Freedom Fine to the Faculty, and their Funds. 215 

in Glasgow, in conjunction with Robert Hamilton, 
Professor of Medicine in the city. This Char¬ 
ter, which was confirmed by Charles II. in 1672 , 
contains very ample privileges, particularly a right 
which the Faculty still exercises, of granting diplo¬ 
mas, after examination, to students in medicine and 
surgery. Without such, none are allowed to prac¬ 
tise within the boroughs of Glasgow, Renfrew, and 
Dunbarton, and the sheriffdoms of Renfrew, Lanark, 
Kyle, Carrick, Ayr, and Cunningham, without be¬ 
coming liable in a fine of £3 : 6 : 8 sterling for each 
offence. Likewise, by a special privilege, the mem¬ 
bers of Faculty are exempted from all “ weapon- 
schawing, redes, hosts, bearing of armour, watching, 
warding, stenting, taxations, or assize inquests, 
justice courts, in actions civil or criminal, excepting 
in giving their counsel in matters appertaining to 
the said arts.” * 

The freedom fine of admission into the Faculty is 
£150. Licentiates within the city or suburbs pay 
twenty, and those who practise in the country five 
guineas. For every diploma taken out, five guineas 
is paid by students, after examination. From their 
ordinary funds, the Faculty, in 1792, set apart £1300 
as a fund for the support of their widows and chil¬ 
dren, which, with the annual payments by the mem¬ 
bers who chose to contribute to the first and second 
rates, was calculated to afford an annuity of £20 to 
widows on the first rate, and £ 100 to children when 


* The members of Faculty are only exempted from being ballotted for 
the regular militia, having soldiers billeted on them, and passing on assize. 












216 Annuities to Widows. 

no widow was left; on the second rate, £15:12:6 
to widows, and £78 : 2 : 6 to children; and on the 
third rate, £ll : 5 to widows, and £56 : 5 to chil¬ 
dren. The free stock of this fund, at Whitsunday 
1817, amounted to £13,611 : 9, affording an annuity 
of £46 to widows on the first rate, £40 to those on 
the second, and £34 to those on the third; with a 
provision to children, where no widow is left, if 
under twenty years of age, on the first £322, the 
second £280, the third £238, or the balance of these 
sums, if the mother shall die or marry before the 
whole sum is drawn as her annuity; and to children 
above twenty years of age, the first £215 : 12 : 6, 
the second £182 : 5 : 3, and the third £150, or the 
balance as above. 

The annuities are paid in advance, from and after 
the first term of Whitsunday or Martinmas immedi¬ 
ately following the death of the husband. At Whit¬ 
sunday 1817, annuities, amounting to £406, were 
paid to ten widows; and, in 1816, one family of 
children above twenty received £215 : 12 : 6. 

From the admission money exigible from en¬ 
trants with the Faculty, £87 .* 15 is applied to the 
Widows’ Fund, which entitles the widow of the 
entrant to be placed on the third, or lowest, rate 
of the fund, by which she will receive £34 per 
annum, during the period of her widowhood; for 
the second rate, which entitles the widow to receive 
£40 per annum, the member must pay the sum of 
£l : 2 : 6 annually ; and for the first rate of £46 per 
annum, the sum of £2 : 5 yearly. No person above

sixty years can be admitted to an interest in the fund ; 
and if above twenty-eight years of age, at entrance, 
he must pay an additional rate conformable to an 
equitable scale. * 

The Faculty have a stock and property as their 
ordinary fund, worth about ten thousand pounds, 
from the interest and rents of which the general 
expenses are defrayed, and assistance is given to de¬ 
cayed members and the families of those who died 
previously to the establishment of the present fund. 

The following regulations respecting the granting 
of diplomas, were instituted by the Faculty on the 
10th September, 1811. Every candidate for a di¬ 
ploma must, previously to his being taken on trial, 
produce satisfactory evidence that he has studied 
medical science three complete winter sessions either 
at a University or under resident members of the 
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons of Edinburgh, 
London, or Dublin, or under members of the Faculty 
©f Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow; and that, 
during that period, he has attended public lectures 
on the following subjects, namely, two courses of 
Anatomy and Surgery delivered in different sessions, 
one course of Chemistry, one of Materia Medica, one 
on the Theory of Medicine, one on the Practice of 
Medicine, and one on Midwifery; and that he has 
attended one year in a public hospital, and studied 
Practical Pharmacy, in a regular Surgeon’s or Apo- 


* In 1812, the Faculty voted Mr. Hugh Miller, Surgeon, Collector to the 
"Widows’ Fund, a valuable piece c|f plate, as a mark of their esteem for his 
important services.

thecary’s shop, during at least six months.—Candi¬ 
dates, who have served an apprenticeship of three or 
more years to a regular practitioner, must produce 
evidence of their having attended all these lectures, 
and a public hospital during the above-mentioned 
period; but the duration of their studies may be 
abridged to two winter courses. 

The Faculty is governed by a President, Visitor, 
Collector, two Box-keepers, a Seal-keeper, Librarian, 
and two Inspectors of Drugs. 

THE FACULTY OF PROCURATORS 

have, during more than three centuries, been united 
into a society for the purpose of managing their 
affairs, and for raising a fund for decayed mem¬ 
bers, and their widows and children. To promote 
these objects, and to enlarge and confirm their pri¬ 
vileges, a royal charter, upon an application being 
made to his present Majesty, was granted in June 
1796, erecting them into a corporation, with power 
to make by-laws, to hold a seal, and to elect office¬ 
bearers. The Faculty is governed by a Dean of Fa¬ 
culty, a council of five Managers, a Treasurer, Clerk, 
and Fiscal. There are two general meetings of the 
Faculty, annually, on the third Friday of May, and 
the third Friday of November. 

Before being admitted a member of Faculty, it is 
necessary that a person have served an apprentice¬ 
ship of five years with one of the Members practising 
before the courts of this city, and a further term of, 
at least, one year as a clerk, either with the practi-

tioners here, in the Court of Session, or any proper 
Law-court. He must also be twenty-one years of 
age, and have attended the Scottish-law-class in any 
of the Universities of Scotland at least one session, 
and undergo both a public and private examination 
on his knowledge of Law and the practice of the 
Courts, by Committees of the Faculty. The ap¬ 
prentice-fee is £30, and £5 to the library when the 
indenture is booked. The entry money as a Procu¬ 
rator and Member of Faculty for the son of a Mem¬ 
ber is £25, for the grandson of a Member £35, and 
for every other person, whose indenture has been 
regularly booked, £50, besides £l0 to the library.* 
The Faculty established a Widows’ Fund in 1812, 
which is derived from their capital. From the sum 
of £50 paid by the Members at entrance, £20 are 
applied to this fund, which entitles a widow to an 
annuity of £l8: 2 : 6. Each Member Is also required 
to pay 20s. annually, or twenty guineas in full. If 
there be no widow left, the children receive a sum 
equal to five years of their mother’s annuity. The 
stock of the Faculty is restricted to £1000, the ba¬ 
lance to be transferred to the Widows’ Fund.

tings on the Political Economy of the Capital and 
of the river Thames. The society embraces a wide 
range, and was instituted by a royal charter bearing 
date July 31st, 1783. It consists not only of Mem¬ 
bers residing in Glasgow, but includes Merchants, 
Traders, and Manufacturers in Paisley and Green¬ 
ock. Agreeably to the charter, two general meet¬ 
ings are held, the one on the first Wednesday of 
January, the other on the first Wednesday of July. 
The chief outlines of the charge to the directors are, 
to watch over the general interests of commerce, 
and to point out new sources of promoting them; 
to attend to applications made to parliament, which 
may be thought to injure the trade and manufactures 
of this country; and to correspond with the con¬ 
vention of Royal Boroughs and Board of Trustees 
for Fisheries and Manufactures, for the purpose of 
suggesting improvements.—The admission-fee to 
the Chamber of Commerce is ten guineas, or £5:5, 
and half a guinea per annum. 

COMMISSIONERS ON THE RIVER CLYDE. 

Their business is to encourage commerce by faci¬ 
litating the navigation of the river. In 1688, the 
Broomielaw quay was first enlarged at the expense 
of 30,000 merks Scots. In 1759, an act of Parlia¬ 
ment was obtained for improving and deepening the 
river; in 1792, the quay received an addition of 
360 feet to the west end, and, in 1811, a further 
enlargement of 900 feet was begun and completed. 
The Commissioners have executed many inestimable 




Height of neap and spring tides at the Broomielaw. 221 

improvements, so that vessels of considerable bur¬ 
den are now navigated to the quay. In 1806, a 
schooner of 150 tons, direct from Lisbon, unloaded 
her cargo at the Broomielaw, while those of 40 tons, 
only a few years before, reached it with difficulty. 
At present, vessels of about 140 tons arrive at the 
same place. * At the west end of the Broomielaw, 
the river is 140 feet wide, and increases about four 
feet every quarter of a mile, for the first two miles 
downwards; the next three miles, five feet for every 
quarter of a mile, and so on. At Dunbarton, the 
river is two miles broad, and at Greenock, nearly four. 
Glasgow is distant from Port-Glasgow, by water, 
about 22 miles. The fall from the former to the 
latter, is 8 feet 6 inches. The tide flows about 4 
hours and 20 minutes; much depends, however, 
upon the weather and winds. Neap tides at Glas¬ 
gow are about 3 feet 6 inches, and spring tides 
about 5 feet 6 inches; and vessels drawing 9 feet 6 
inches of water can come up to Glasgow in an ordi¬ 
nary spring tide. The current, during a high fresh, 
runs at the rate of 4 miles an hour to the Broomie¬ 
law, and is perceptible a mile above Rutherglen; at 
ordinary tides, it averages about 2 \ miles an hour. 
In common tides, the first turning at Port-Glasgow 


* From July 1795 to 1796, there arrived at the Broomielaw 1326 vessels 
from 10 to 70 tons burden, and their tonnage amounted to 55,980. From 
July 1805 to 1806, 1678 arrived from 10 to 100 tons, and the tonnage was 
80,863. From July 1815 to 1816, 2243 arrived from 40 to upwards of 100 
tons, the tonnage 140,791. In the course of the month of January, 1818, 
there arrived 391 vessels, 78 of which were considerably above 100 tons, and 
the amount of tonnage per register was 23,764.

is 2 hours and 45 minutes earlier than at Glasgow. 
Since Mr. James Spreull’s appointment to the su¬ 
perintendence of the river, on 8th May 1798, some 
very valuable and important improvements have 
taken place; in particular, he has formed a num¬ 
ber of parallel dykes, at the inner extremities of the 
jettees, which have prevented the tide from form¬ 
ing eddies behind the jettees ; and with great zeal, 
skill, and perseverance, he has been successful in 
scouring the bottom of the channel, and in plough¬ 
ing and harrowing up some large stones, which had 
become serious obstructions to the navigation ; and 
by his unremitted exertions, these noble projects 
are hastening towards a prosperous completion. 

THE BANKS.* 

Banking is, comparatively, of recent origin in 
Scotland. The Parliament, in 1695, established at 
Edinburgh the Bank of Scotland, with a nominal 
stock of £ 100 , 000 : but £30,000 were found to be 
a capital quite sufficient, at that period, for transact¬ 
ing the banking business of North-Britain. On the 
qth of April 1696 , branches were planted at Dun¬ 
dee, Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Montrose, but were 
all recalled: on December 26 th 1696 , from Aber- 


* Previously to 1764, the notes issued by the Glasgow Banks, had what 
was called the optional clause: the tenor of the obligation ran thus; ** We 
promise to pay A. B. or bearer, on demand, or, in our option, at six months 
after demand, we paying interest thereon at the rate of five per cent.” As 
this optional clause did not meet the approbation of the mercantile interest, 
application was made to Parliament at the above period, when an Act was 

passed prohibiting the clause in question. 





Insurance Offices.

deeti anti Montrose; on January 2 d 1697 , from 
Glasgow; and on October 6th 1698 , from Dundee. 
Branches were again established, on the 14th of 
July 1731, at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, and 
Berwick, which, however, were all discontinued on 
July 10th 1733. The Royal Bank was instituted 
in 1727, at Edinburgh, and in September 1783, 
settled a branch in Glasgow, which still continues to 
transact business in their splendid Office in Queen- 
street, to a very great extent. In 1 749 , some Mer¬ 
chants of Glasgow settled a bank in the city, and 
circulated notes to a great amount. This is named 
the Ship Bank, is situated in Argyle-street, and con¬ 
tinues to increase in high respectability and credit. 
The Thistle Bank was established in 1761, and is 
conducted in Virginia-slreet; another, begun in 
1809, is denominated the Glasgow Bank, the affairs 
of which are managed in an office on the north side 
of the east end of Ingram-street. 

Besides these, are the following branches ; 


Aberdeen Bank.

LITERARY SOCIETY. 


This was established in 1752, and consists chiefly 
of the professors in the University, and clergymen of 
the city and neighbourhood. Subjects of all kinds, 
having reference to science or taste, are discussed at 
their meetings, which are held once a fortnight, in 
the Faculty-hall of the College. Each member in 
his turn reads an essay, which is criticised afterwards 
by the other members. He who gives an essay one 
night is president the next.—As an instance of the 
attachment which may be formed by a person of taste 
to an institution of this kind, the late John Millar, 
Esq. professor of law, eminent for his writings on 
political economy, had such a predilection for this 
society, that he never once foiled, in the course of for - 
iy years , to attend the meetings, and read a discourse 
in his turn.

Philosophical Society.—Stirling’s Public Library. 225 

PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. 

This was formed in November 1802, with the 
intention of advancing the knowledge of physics by 
a free interchange of ideas. When they meet, one of 
the members reads an essay upon some philosophical 
subject; the merits of which are afterwards discussed. 
A library is formed for the use of the society, which 
is governed by a president, vice-president, treasurer, 
secretary, librarian, and twelve directors, chosen by 
ballot. It is composed of three classes of members, 
resident, honorary, and corresponding, of whom the 
two latter receive diplomas without fee. No person 
can be admitted a resident member, unless proposed 
by three persons, and elected by ballot at an ordinary 
meeting. Each member at entry pays three guineas, 
and half a guinea yearly afterwards. 

STIRLING’S PUBLIC LIBRARY 

was instituted in January 1791 , agreeably to the 
will of the late Mr. Walter Stirling, who bequeathed 
£ 1000 , his library, dwelling-house, with his share 
of the tontine buildings, in favour of the Lord Pro¬ 
vost in office, three members from the Town-council, 
three from the Merchants’ House, three from the 
Presbytery of Glasgow, and three from the Faculty 
of Physicians and Surgeons, for the establishment of 
a library, and supporting a librarian, for the use of 
the inhabitants of Glasgow. The directors meet 
four times a year, for the purpose of managing the 
business of the library. In 1792, they were incor-*

porated into a society, by a seal of cause from the 
magistrates and council. The number of subscribers 
is 424; of volumes, upwards of 6000 . Every atten¬ 
tion has been paid to the proper selection of books, 
for the purchase of which, above £l00 are expended 
yearly. The entry money originally was £3: 3, it 
was raised to £5: 5, and it is now &lt;£10: 10.—The 
library is kept in a spacious hall of Hutchesons* 
Hospital. * 


* Literature was not only patronized, but successfully cultivated, by our 
kings of the Stuart race. The subjoined notices respecting the ancient Royal 
Library of Scotland, under their auspices, are offered to those whom such 
topics are calculated to please.—No. I. appears to be a list of the king’s books, 
but in what reign it was made has not been ascertained. No. II. may be 
called an Invoice of Books, with their prices, but the name of the bookseller, 
or person who furnished them, is unknown. It is followed by an order from

every month for the transaction of business. By a 
charter from the magistrates, of date September 13th, 
1811, the institution has been incorporated; and the 
books, consisting of more than 4300 volumes of select 
works in science, literature, and taste, are vested in 
trust of the curators for behoof of the public. On 
all occasions the senior curator, present, presides; 
and no book can be received into the library till ap¬ 
proved by a majority of voices in a general meeting. 

As this institution is formed on popular principles, 
the terms of admission are arranged on an inviting 
and moderate scheme. By this, each subscriber is 
bound to pay 10s. 6d. annually, and 12s. under the 
name of entry money, but his right is, at any time, 
transferable. The number of subscribers, in 1818, 
exceeded 550; by which means, the society is enabled 
to expend two hundred and fifty pounds yearly, to¬ 
wards increasing the stock, the value of which is

greatly advanced by the reception of many periodical 
works of the first celebrity and merit. 

The library is kept in Millar’s school, George’s- 
street. 

ROBERTSONIAN LIBRARY. 

This institution was formed in the year 1814, 
and already contains nearly 4000 volumes. It con¬ 
sisted, originally, of the library of the Rev. James 
Robertson of Kilmarnock, which had been long dis¬ 
tinguished as one of the first collections of theological 
literature in this part of the country, and as contain¬ 
ing many rare, curious, and valuable works. To 
those, there has since been added an extensive col¬ 
lection of books of the first celebrity, in almost all 
departments of science; also, the most celebrated 
periodical and other literary works of the day. The 
proprietors belong to that portion of the Secession 
Church of which Mr. Robertson was a minister, and 
founded the library both with the view of aiding 
their own studies, and cherishing a spirit of biblical 
and literary inquiry among the students and mem¬ 
bers of their own and other religious connexions. 

It was laid open to the public at large on the 
most liberal terms. Subscribers are admitted on 
paying 10s. 6d. each per annum. There are two 
hundred shares of £5 each, and one hundred and 
eight readers. The annual proceeds, after paying 
expenses, are laid out in purchasing books.—This 
library is situated in Mitchell-street.

252 Trades* House School.—Highland Society. 


TRADES 7 HOUSE SCHOOL 

was instituted in 1808, for educating 108 boys, sons 
of trades’ burgesses, and is governed by the deacon 
convener, who is styled governor; the oldest trades' 
baillie, deputy governor; late convener, late gover¬ 
nor; and the collector of the Trades’ House, trea¬ 
surer; and one from each Incorporation, making in 
all eighteen. These boys are taught the English 
language, writing, arithmetic, book-keeping, geo¬ 
graphy, and church music, and receive the present 
of a bible when they leave school. They continue 
in it during four years; and a Juvenile Library is 
established for their use. This is increased by a 
sum given annually from the Trades’ House. The 
whole of the late Deacon William Tassie’s library 
was given, in 1811, to this school, by his will. Each 
Incorporation sends two boys for every member re¬ 
presenting them in the house, and pays, for each, 
fifteen shillings annually towards the expense of con¬ 
ducting the school, (See Table, page 205, J besides a 
proportionate additional sum yearly for books. The 
Trades’ House makes up the deficiency of salary to 
the schoolmaster, and furnishes a school-room. 

GLASGOW HIGHLAND SOCIETY. 

The benefits of this charitable institution, which 
was founded in 1727* are confined to the sons of 
indigent parents, either natives of the Highlands of 
Scotland, or of Highland descent. This society 
maintains sixty boys, twenty of which go out of the

school yearly to trades. During the first three years 
of their apprenticeship, besides education in the eve¬ 
ning, they are clothed at the expense of the society. 
The schools are frequently examined by the box- 
masters; and inquiry respecting the behaviour of the 
apprentices is made at the workshops of the masters, 
at least twice a year. At the expiry of the time 
specified by the indenture, exemplary good conduct 
and professional merit, entitle each boy to a silver 
medal, with an appropriate inscription. 

The funds required for these purposes, arise from 
the rent of the Black Bull Inn and shops, and from 
the entry money of new members. 

MARINE SOCIETY 

was formed in 1758, for relieving seamen belonging 
to the river Clyde, and their families. There are 
above 800 persons who receive aliment from this 
institution, from £3 to &lt;£l: 10 per annum; which 
sum is raised from 4d. per ton on all vessels in the 
Clyde, and 4d. per month from sailors’ wages. 

SOCIETY OF THE SONS OF THE CLERGY. 

This society has been formed for the purpose of 
relieving the indigent descendants of ministers of 
the church of Scotland. It is formed of the sons of 
clergymen who are enabled to assist others who have 
been less fortunate than themselves. It was estab¬ 
lished in 179&lt;b and the following year incorporated 
by a charter from the magistrates. Not less than 
five guineas is paid by each member on admission ; 

u 3 







234 Society of Teachers.—Widows* Fund Society. 

and by this sum, donations, and the collections at the 
church doors, when an annual sermon is preached 
for behoof of the society, its funds are supported. 

SOCIETY OF TEACHERS 

was projected in 1794, for the purpose of relieving 
such ordinary members, their widows and children, 
as may be deprived of the means of supporting 
themselves. When any member by indisposition is 
prevented from attending his business, he is allowed 
at least &lt;£l: 1 per month; and if he has more than 
one child, under fourteen years of age, 2s. additional 
per month is added. Widows are allowed, while 
they remain so, 10s. 6d. per month, with the above 
allowance to children. If the mother die, or marry, 
the child or children of the deceased member, below 
the age of fourteen, receive the mother’s allowance ; 
and that sum also is given to a widower’s children, 
if necessary. 

GLASGOW WIDOWS’ FUND SOCIETY 

was formed in 1805, for the purpose of securing an 
annuity for the widows of members, and an allow¬ 
ance to their children. The original entry money 
was six pounds, with twenty-four shillings, to be 
contributed in quarterly proportions of annual pay¬ 
ment. It is governed by a set of equitable and ju¬ 
dicious laws, administered by a preses, treasurer, and 
twelve directors. If the late husband of the widow 
has been five years a member of the society, the wi¬ 
dow is entitled to J02O per annum in her own right. 


Annuity Society. 


235 


and each child, under fourteen years of age, £2 per 
annum. Each of the orphan children of a person 
who shall have been a member for five years, is al¬ 
lowed £6 per year, until they arrive at the age of 
fourteen. In 1817, the entry money was raised to 
£18, and the stock of the institution vested in heri¬ 
table property, of which the yearly rental exceeds 
£ 900 . Their capital, in May 1817, amounted to 
.€11,096: 11 : 2. At that period, the society con¬ 
sisted of 307 members, and they paid annuities to 
19 widows, and allowance to 51 children. 

GLASGOW ANNUITY SOCIETY, 

the first of the kind in Scotland, was instituted in 
January 1808. The object of the institution is to 
secure a fund for its members in advanced age: for 
this purpose, a certain payment is made quarterly, 
or a sufficient sum sunk at once, which entitles the 
members after a certain age to an annuity for life. 
The tables are formed on equitable and accurate 
principles, to regulate the payments, which have 
been examined and approved of by Mr. Morgan, 
the celebrated calculator of London. The annuities 
commence at 50, 55, and 60, and may amount to any 
sum from £l0 upwards.—The society have vested 
their capital in heritable property, in Annuity-court, 
York-street, which yields a rental of £243. The 
quarterly payments amount to about £200 per an¬ 
num : the stock will therefore be very considerable 
before any material demand is made on it. Persons 

of either sex are admitted. 

• - ••••■•' 


236 Agricultural Society.—Thistle and Rose Society, &amp;c. 


AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY. 

This was formed about the year 1787* At first 
its sole object was the improvement of agriculture, 
but afterwards it was also made subservient to chari¬ 
table purposes. It consists of members from above 
thirty parishes, and from among these delegates are 
chosen to manage the society. 

THE THISTLE AND ROSE SOCIETY 

was instituted in 1807, upon the most extensive 
scale and liberal principles of any in this city. The 
members, after being three years in the society, are 
obliged to receive 15s. per week when unable to at¬ 
tend their employment, and £l when confined to 
bed. 

WINE AND SPIRIT-DEALERS’ SOCIETY. 

The plan of this society includes provision for 
sickness, a fund for an annuity at the ages of 50, 
55, and 60, a fund for funeral expenses, and one for 
annuities to widows. Tables are calculated for each 
of these classes, to regulate the payments. A mem¬ 
ber has it in his power to limit or extend his interest 
in this society, by holding in all, or either of the 
tables, one or more shares as may be most agreeable 
to himself. It was instituted in 1811. 

THE COMPANY OF GROCERS 

was established in 1789, and afterwards incorporated 
by a charter from the magistrates. The admission 




rf . rt f . ry rrf . r ^

money to this society is £ 7 : 10, and the relief they 
allow their members when in distress is from J06 to 
£\2 per annum. 

GLASGOW AUXILIARY BIBLE SOCIETY 

was instituted in 1812, with the design of supporting 
the parent society in London; whose well known 
object, and that of similar institutions, is the dissem¬ 
ination of the Sacred Scriptures, without any note 
or comment, over all the earth. It is aided by the 
contributions of more than thirty branch associations, 
formed in the city and adjacent districts. 

SOCIETY FOlt SUNDAY SCHOOLS 

was formed in 1787, and afterwards incorporated by 
a charter from the magistrates, for the purpose of 
educating poor children. There are twelve Sunday 
schools in the city and suburbs, in which instruction 
is given to upwards of 600 children. 

In addition to these schools, there are Sabbath 
School Associations, in which about 1400 poor chil¬ 
dren are taught to read. 

THE FEMALE SOCIETY 

was instituted in 1799 , by a number of ladies, who 
are the directresses, and who visit their pensioners. 
Its object is to relieve the wants, and mitigate the 
distresses of indigent females, by the distribution of 
small pensions. Widows and orphans constitute the 
great proportion of those (about 250 yearly) who 
experience the benevolence of this institution. 





238 Stranger Poor’s Society.—Stranger’s Friend Society, &amp;c. 


THE SOCIETY 

for the relief of the Stranger Poor was formed in 
1790, by some benevolent citizens. Their funds 
have increased so rapidly, that many thousands have 
been relieved by the administration of pecuniary and 
medical assistance. 

STRANGER’S FRIEND SOCIETY 

instituted in January 1803, is conducted by persons 
of the Methodist communion, and is deserving of pub¬ 
lic patronage. The directors of it visit the abodes of 
necessitous strangers, and alleviate their misfortunes 
by supplying them with money, medical assistance, 
and sometimes clothing. 

SOCIETY 

for the encouragement of Penitents, was formed in 
1817, and is supported by voluntary contribution. 
The attention of its members is directed to the two¬ 
fold object of endeavouring the reformation of boys 
discharged from the prison and bridewell, and that 
of females who have been the victims of seduction, 
but who, convinced of the evil of their ways, have 
manifested at least the appearance of penitence. It 
is governed by a president, secretary, treasurer, and 
twenty-nine directors. 

COW-POX DISPENSARY. 

The Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons appoint 
two of their members to attend every Monday, in

their hall, St. Enoch’s-square, for the purpose of 
inoculating, gratis, with the cow-pox, the children 
of the poor, of whom, above 40,000 have been ino¬ 
culated. 

Independent of this Dispensary, a Cow-Pox In¬ 
stitution is just forming, (April 1818,) by a number 
of medical gentlemen, for the purpose of extending 
the benefits to all the poor gratis , and to others at a 
moderate rate. 

PROVIDENT BANK. 

Provident or Savings’ Banks are now generally 
recognised as being highly beneficial to the lower 
classes of society. Sums of one shilling and upwards 
may be deposited in them, and these bear interest at 
the rate of four per cent, when they amount to 12 s. 
6d., and have lain a month in the bank. When a 
contributor deposits so much as £&gt;\0, his stock is 
transferred in his name to any of the ordinary banks 
he may desire, and the receipt delivered to him. 
When a person wishes to withdraw any part of his 
money, the sum cannot be less than 6s. at one time. 
—An institution of this kind was established at Glas¬ 
gow, in 1815, and is placed under the management 
of a governor, deputy governor, and twenty-eight 
directors. The Royal Bank of Scotland allows the 
Provident Bank five per cent, for money lodged there, 
and from the one per cent, above the usual interest, 
with a per centage on a subscription fund of more

240 The General Session—St. Nicholas’ Hospital, &amp;c. 


THE GENERAL SESSION 

is composed of the clergy of the city and their elders. 
They distribute the money collected at the church 
doors, and that received for tolling bells at funerals, 
for proclamation of marriages, and donations. They 
likewise receive two-thirds of the collection at the 
Cannon-street Chapel, £l6‘ per annum from the Gae¬ 
lic Chapel in Ingram-street, and £30 from the Gaelic 
Chapel in Duke-street. They pay a certain sum for 
supporting the Town-hospital, a salary to each of six 
teachers of charity schools, and the balance, in cer¬ 
tain proportions, to the sessions of each of the nine 
parishes.

ST. NICHOLAS’ HOSPITAL 

was founded by Bishop Muirhead, in the 15th cen¬ 
tury, for the maintenance of twelve old men and a 
priest. Archbishop Leighton, in l677&gt; mortified 
£150 sterling, for the benefit of two poor men. 
There are ten pensioners on this society, at £3 per 
annum.

rections of different donors; and the remainder is 
expended in the relief of decayed members, their 
widows, and descendants. 

THE TRADES’ HOSPITAL 

was founded previously to 1605, for the support of 
twenty-seven poor men, belonging to the fourteen 
incorporations, paid in different proportions. 

HUTCHESONS’ HOSPITAL 

originated in mortifications by two brothers, George 
and Thomas Hutcheson, in the years 1639,1640, and 
1641. These, intended at the time for the support of 
no more than twelve old men and twelve boys, have 
been increased by subsequent mortifications, dona¬ 
tions, legacies, and good management, to funds so 
very considerable, that the patrons have been enabled 
not only to increase the number of old men and boys, 
but also to extend the benefit of the charity to women. 
The patrons of this institution are the Lord Provost, 
Dean of Guild, Deacon Convener, the members of 
the Town-council, and the established ministers of 
the city. Besides for the original number, provision 
is now made for seventy-six boys, including four on 
Blair’s and eight on Baxter’s Mortifications. The 
boys on Hutchesons’ foundation receive £3 sterling, 
per annum, in name of maintenance; and the whole 
are educated, during four years, in the English lan¬ 
guage, writing, arithmetic, and church music. 

The original sum bequeathed for these humane

purposes was a tenement of land, barn and yard, and 
ground whereon to build the hospital, and likewise 
68,700 merles , or £3816 : 13 : 4 sterling. This had 
accumulated, in 1818, to £27,344 : 14 : 1, and the 
expenditure, at the same period, was £2958 : 19:7* 
The property has increased so much in consequence 
of feuing the ground on which Hutchesontown is 
built. 

George, the eldest of these venerable brothers, was 
a public notary and w r riter in Glasgow, and is reputed 
to have been a very honest man in his profession. He 
was so moderate in his charges, that, it is credibly 
reported, he never would take more than sixteen pen¬ 
nies Scots for writing an ordinary bond, be the sum 
ever so large. Thomas, his brother, was also a writer, 
and keeper of, and clerk to, the Register of Seasines 
of the regality of Glasgow and its district. He died 
on September 1st, 1641, in the fifty-second year of 
his age, and is buried in the south side of the Cathe¬ 
dral, where his monument still remains. 

SCOTSTARBET’S MORTIFICATION. 

Sir John Scott of Scotstarbet, mortified and con¬ 
veyed to the Magistrates and Council, in 1653, the 
lands of Pucky, in Fife, for the purpose of putting 
twelve “ Scotch bairns ” to apprenticeships within 
the city. These are incorporated, and educated with 
those in Wilson’s School, and receive clothing instead 
of apprentice-fees. The above lands rent for up¬ 
wards of £90 per annum.

Snell’s, Mitchell’s, and Tennent’s Mortifications. 243 

SNELL’S MORTIFICATION. 

The Mortification by Mr. Snell deserves particu¬ 
larly to be mentioned, as perhaps one of the largest 
and most liberal in Britain. That gentleman, in the 
year 1688 , bequeathed a considerable estate in War¬ 
wickshire for the support of ten Scottish students at 
Baliol College, Oxford, who shall have studied for 
some years at the University of Glasgow. By the 
rise in the value of lands, and the improvements 
which have, from time to time, been made on that 
estate, the funds now afford T70 per annum for ten 
years, to each of the ten exhibitioners. Another 
mortification, at the same college, of £20 per an¬ 
num to each of four Scottish students, though under 
a different patronage, is generally given to the Glas¬ 
gow exhibitioners ; so that four of them have a sti¬ 
pend of £g0 per annum, continuing for ten years. 
The university has the sole nomination and appoint¬ 
ment to these exhibitions. 

MITCHELL’S MORTIFICATION. 

Mr. William Mitchell, merchant in London, a 
native of Glasgow, in 1729&gt; mortified the sum of 
J02OOO sterling, for the maintenance of several poor 
burgesses or their children. 

TENNENT’S MORTIFICATION. 

Mr. Robert Tennent, merchant in Glasgow, in 
1741, bequeathed for the poor children in the cha¬ 
rity-schools erected by his brother, the sum of 5000

merks; and 6000 merks for the support of three 
widows of citizens. He also left 10,000 merks, to 
be lent by the magistrates for five years, in separate 
sums, free of interest, to fifteen merchants and five 
tradesmen of the city. The magistrates now appro¬ 
priate the interest of these funds to different widows, 
and furnish shoes and stockings to charity-schools 
under the management of the General Session. 

WILSON’S MORTIFICATION. 

Mr. George Wilson of London, but originally of 
Glasgow, in 1778, bequeathed £3000 for the purpose 
of clothing and educating a certain number of poor 
boys. The original has been augmented by subse¬ 
quent donations; forty-eight boys now receive the 
benefit of this institution. 

BAXTER’S MORTIFICATION. 

Daniel Baxter, bookseller in Glasgow, died in De¬ 
cember 1784, and left his whole subject in favour of 
Hutchesons’ Hospital, which, after paying legacies 
and expenses, amounted to £2700 sterling. From 
this fund several old men have pensions, and eight 
boys are educated in Hutchesons’ School. 

COULTER'S MORTIFICATION. 

Mr. James Coulter, merchant in Glasgow, in 1788, 
left £200 sterling, in trust to the Magistrates, as a 
fund for an annual premium to such as should im¬ 
prove or invent any machine calculated to facilitate 
the manufactures. He likewise left £1200, the in-

terest of which to be divided in sums from £4 to 
£10, to respectable persons in indigent circumstan¬ 
ces. Before his death he gave £400 towards the 
erection of a Bridewell, and £500 for the formation, 
in conjunction with his brother, of a Humane So¬ 
ciety in the city. 

MILLAR’S MORTIFICATION. 

Mr. Andrew Millar, merchant in Glasgow, in 
1790, bequeathed his whole estate, amounting to 
£7,074 : 10 : 6 sterling, for the purpose of clothing 
and educating, for three years, a certain number of 
indigent girls. Sixty of these are now in the school, 
and the expenditure for their support, in 1818, 
amounted to £462 : 9* The original stock has ac¬ 
cumulated to £8,417 : 15 : 11. 

MACALPINE’S MORTIFICATION. 

This Mortification was founded in 1811, by the 
late Mrs. Helen Macalpine, spouse of Archibald 
Broadley, tailor in Glasgow. By her deed of settle¬ 
ment she conveyed to the trustees therein named, 
her whole property, amounting to between £2000 
and £3000, the annual produce of which, after pay¬ 
ment of her debts, funeral expenses, and a few lega¬ 
cies, she appointed to be laid out in the maintenance 
of men and women in poor circumstances, under 
certain qualifications specified in that deed; the men 
receiving annual pensions of £lO, and the women of 
£5 each. The trustees are, the Convener of the 
Trades, the two Trades’ Baillies, and the Ministers

246 Principle of Friendly Societies, &amp;c. 

of the nine established churches of Glasgow, for the 
time being. 

Such is a brief enumeration of the public insti¬ 
tutions, incorporated societies, and charitable foun¬ 
dations * in Glasgow. There are, likewise, many 
other similar associations of inferior consideration, 
and of less extensive influence. These are known 
by the name of Friendly Societies , and their number 
is about 140, within the city and suburbs. The 
first of this kind was established, in 1743, under the 
name of the Journeymen Dyers’ Society. As they 
are all formed upon nearly resembling schemes, the 
following statement will exhibit an outline of their 
general plan. 

Members are admitted between fourteen and forty 
years of age; the entry money is from 5s. to 20s.; 
the quarterly payments Is. Id., which entitle a 
person, after having been two or three years a mem¬ 
ber, to 5s. or 6s. a week when sick and bedfast, from 
3s. to 4s. when able to walk about, and from Is. to 
2 s. when superannuated. Funeral expenses of 
or £2 are also allowed; and in some instances, the 
widows of deceased members receive, each, from £l 
to £2 per annum. 


* An estimate was made in 1817, whereby it is made apparent that, in 
1816, a sum not less than £104,391: 2 was distributed in Glasgow by public 
and private charity.

THE STAGE. 


Early dramatic performances. 

THE earliest dramatic entertainments exhibited 
in England, as well as every other part of Europe, 
were of a religious kind. So early as the beginning 
of the twelfth century, it was customary in Eng¬ 
land, on holy festivals, to represent, in or near the 
ehurches, either the lives or miracles of saints, ol* 
the more mysterious parts of holy writ, such as the 
Incarnation, Passion, or Resurrection of Christ.— 
These scriptural plays were denominated Miracles , 
or Mysteries: but they were so far from being con¬ 
sidered as indecent or profane, that even a supreme 
pontiff. Pope Pius II., about the year 1416, com¬ 
posed and caused to be acted before him on Corpus 
Christi-day, a Mystery, in which was represented 
the court of the King of Heaven. 

As learning increased, and was more widely dis¬ 
seminated, from the monasteries, by a natural and 
easy transition, the practice migrated to schools and 
universities, which were formed on the monastic 
plan, and in many respects resembled the ecclesias¬ 
tical bodies. Licentious pleasantries were sometimes 
used in these religious representations, which might 
imperfectly lead to subjects entirely profane, and to

comedy; and this, perhaps, much earlier than is 
imagined. * 


* A Mrs. Hughs (1665) is thought to have been the first female actress that 
appeared in any regular drama on a public stage. She performed the part 
of Desdemona, in the ‘ Moor of Venice,’ at Drury-lane, London. The fol¬ 
lowing verses, spoken by way of introducing her to the audience, were writ¬ 
ten by Thomas Jordan, an actor and poet. * 

PROLOGUE. 

“ I come, unknown to any of the rest. 

To tell you news; I saw the lady drest: 

The woman plays to-day: mistake me not, 

No man in gown, or page in petticoat: 

A woman to my knowledge; yet I can’t. 

If I should die, make affidavit on’t. 

Do you not twitter, gentlemen ? I know 
You will be censuring: do it fairly though. 

’Tis possible a virtuous woman may 
Abhor all sorts of looseness, and yet play; 

Play on the stage,—where all eyes are upon her :— 

Shall we count that a crime, France counts an honour? 

In other kingdoms husbands safely trust ’em; 

The difference lies only in the custom. 

And let it be our custom, I advise; 

I’m sure this custom’s better than tli’ excise. 

And may procure us custom: hearts of flint 
Will melt in passion, when a woman’s in’t. 

But, gentlemen, you that as judges sit 
In the star-chamber of the house, the pit. 

Have modest thoughts of her; pray, do not run. 

To give her visits when the play is done, 

With * Damn me, your most humble servant, lady ;* 

She knows these things as well as you, it may be: 

Not a bit there, dear gallants, she doth know 
Her own deserts,—and your temptations too.— 

But to the point:—In this reforming age 
We have intents to civilize the stage. 

Our women are defective, and so siz’d, 

You’d think they were some of the guard disguis’d; 

For, to speak truth, men act, that are between 
Forty and fifty, wenches of fifteen; 

With bone so large, and nerve so incompliant, 

When you call Desdemona, enter Giant.

First attempt to establish a theatre in Glasgow. 249 

At the beginning of the 16th century, the per¬ 
formance of Mysteries became so common in Scot¬ 
land as to be complained of as a nuisance. * The 
first set of itinerant players in Glasgow, performed 
in 1750 in a room called Burrell's Hall, in the High- 
street. About 1752, a wooden booth was erected 
against a wall in the castle-yard, near the cathedral. 
It was projected by Mr. Lee, and Messrs. Digges, 
Love, Stampier, and Mrs. Ward, were the perform¬ 
ers. In 1762, Messrs. Jackson, Beate, and Love, 
solicited the building of a theatre, which was erect¬ 
ed in Grahamstown, opened in 1764*, and rented by 
Beate and Love, who engaged the Edinburgh com¬ 
pany, among whom was Mrs. Bellamy, to perform. 
Unfortunately, an unruly mob set fire to the house, 
and she lost property to the amount of £$00. Af- 


We shall purge every thing that is unclean. 

Lascivious, scurrilous, impious, or obscene; 

And when we’ve put all things in this fair way, 

Baiiebones himself may come to see a play.” 

EPILOGUE. 

•• And how do you like her ? Come, what is’t ye drive at ? 

She’s the same thing in public as in private; 

As far from being what you call a whore. 

As Desdemona, injur’d by the Moor: 

Then he that censures her in such a case, 

Hath a soul blacker than Othello’s face. 

But, ladies, what think you ? for if you tax 
Her freedom with dishonour to your sex. 

She means to act no more, and this shall be 
No other play but her own tragedy. 

She will submit to none but your commands. 

And take commission only from your hands.” 

* The first regular theatre erected in Scotland subsequent to the Refor¬ 
mation, was in the Cannongate of Edinburgh. It was opened in the winter 
of 1646.

Various managers from 1768 till 1804. 

ter this, the theatre was repaired and occupied, at 
different times, by the Edinburgh company, till it 
was taken by one Williams, who possessed it from 
1768 till 1771. Messrs. Wilkinson, Mills, and Jack- 
son succeeded, but it was also burnt down in the 
winter of 1780, and every thing in it completely de¬ 
stroyed. The wardrobe was estimated at £1000. 
Mr. Jackson, in 1781, purchased a piece of ground 
in Dunlop-street, and built another theatre, at the 
expense of £3000, which continued in his possession 
and direction, with the exception of a few years, 
during which it was conducted by Mr. S. Kemble. 

From the rapid increase of Glasgow, Mr. Jack¬ 
son’s theatre was found too small. To remedy this 
defect, a subscription took place for a new royal 
theatre, at £25 shares, and was soon filled up. 
Ground was purchased in Queen-street, and a splen¬ 
did building, which does honour to the city, has 
been erected, at an expense of upwards of £18,500, 
including the ground and scenery. Messrs. Jackson 
and Aikin contracted, in 1804, for a six years’ lease 
of it, for £1200 per annum; but, previously to the 
expiry of this, Mr. Aikin disposed of his interest in 
it to the late Mr. Rock, many years a favourite per¬ 
former in this city, who became the acting manager, 
for which, from his knowledge of the stage, and po¬ 
pularity as an actor, he was well fitted. In 1808, 
it was taken by Mr. Beaumont, of the Aberdeen 
theatre, at the yearly rent of £1200, who brought a 
very good company, and produced several new pieces 
in very excellent style, but his expenses and general

arrangements were so much beyond the support he 
received, that he was obliged to relinquish it, after 
sustaining considerable loss. Mr. Bartley, now 
of Drury-lane Theatre, and Mr. Trueman, became 
the lessees in 1809* at the reduced rent of £ 60 0 
yearly. The management principally devolved up¬ 
on the former of these gentlemen, who was extremely 
popular, both as manager and actor, and performed, 
in a most respectable manner, an extensive range of 
characters, both in tragedy and comedy. It was let, 
in November 1811, at £500 yearly, to Mr. Montgo¬ 
mery, manager of the Greenock, Dumfries, and other 
theatres, but he only held it during one season. Mr. 
M f Cready, the manager of the Newcastle Theatre, 
was the next tenant: he opened it in April 1813, 
and brought an excellent company, among whom 
was his son, Mr. William M'Cready, w r ho was much 
admired, and is now a favourite actor at Covent- 
garden. With no usual activity, Mr. M'Cready 
brought forward a variety of new pieces, some of 
which were tolerably attractive; but the success he 
met with was not sufficient to induce him to retain 
it longer than one year. 

In consequence of a considerable debt due upon 
the property, and which was constantly accumulat¬ 
ing, it was exposed to public sale in April 1814, by 
the original proprietors, and purchased by Messrs. 
Robert Ferrie, Patrick Playfair, William Mills, and 
Colin Arrot, merchants in Glasgow, for £5000, and 
under the burden of a ground-annual of £100. Im¬ 
mediately after, these gentlemen let it to Mr. Henry 






252 First appearance of Kean and Miss O’Neil on the Glasgow boards. 


Johnston, formerly of Covent-garden Theatre, who, 
during his first season, in consequence of fortuitous 
circumstances, was uncommonly successful. The 
celebrated Mr. Kean, of the Drury-lane Theatre, 
was engaged for six nights, upon the unprecedented 
terms of £l00 per night; and on this occasion the 
prices of admission were raised, the boxes to 7s., the 
pit to 5s., first gallery 3s.,. and second gallery 2s. 
Mr. Kean made his appearance upon the 20th of 
April, 1815, and so great was the desire to see this 
distinguished performer, that a number of families 
came for that purpose from distant parts of the 
country. The receipts during the six nights he 
performed amounted to nearly £2300; and upon 
the last of these nights, Mr. Kean’s benefit, the re¬ 
ceipts amounted to £450—the greatest sum that had 
ever been taken for one performance. Miss O’Neil, 
of Covent-garden Theatre, made her appearance for 
a few nights the following summer, and during 
her engagement, also, the prices of admission were 
raised, the boxes to 6s., the pit to 4s., and the first 
gallery to 2s. This created considerable opposition, 
principally on account of the admission not having 
been altered while she performed in Edinburgh, 
where the theatre is much smaller than that of 
Glasgow, and materially injured the house. Mr. 
Johnston relinquished the management in May, 
1817, after having held it for three years. 

It was now found, after repeated trials under dif¬ 
ferent managers, that the Glasgow Theatre, uncon¬ 
nected with that of Edinburgh, or some other theatre 






Theatre rented by Mr. W. Murray. 253 

equally respectable, was not capable of supporting 
dramatic entertainments. In consequence of this, a 
negotiation took place with the representatives of the 
late Mr. H. Siddons, who hold the Edinburgh The¬ 
atre, and it was taken by them for one year at the 
rent of £700. It was opened by a most respectable 
company, under the direction of Mr. William Mur¬ 
ray, a gentleman who, from his intimate knowledge 
of the stage, and respectability of character, promises 
to give every satisfaction as manager. At the head 
of the performers is his sister, Mrs. H. Siddons, who 
is not more distinguished as an actress, than for her 
amiable conduct in private life. The system of ma¬ 
nagement hitherto pursued is unexceptionable, and 
has given the most perfect satisfaction to the admir¬ 
ers of the drama. In consequence of the junction 
of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Theatres, the season 
is altered, commencing in the month of October, 
and continuing till about the beginning of January, 
when the company go to Edinburgh, and remain 
four months. They afterwards return to Glasgow 
for about two months. In July and August the 
Theatre will be open for a short time, for the per¬ 
formance of London actors, or, as they are generally 
called, Stars. 

In March 1818, the Theatre was again sold by 
auction, and bought by a few gentlemen at £5400. 
-—Mr. Murray opened it on March 25th, for four 
nights, when Mr. Kean paid his fourth visit to Glas¬ 
gow, and performed to very crowded houses. The 

Y ' 




254 Assemblies, Concerts, &amp;c. 

receipts amounted to £850.—Mr. Murray’s former 
lease expiring in May, he again renewed it for three 
years, at the reduced rent of £400 per annum, ex¬ 
clusive of interest on money expended on repairs. 

ASSEMBLIES, CONCERTS, &amp;c. 

These were long kept in one of the Tontine rooms, 
but are now held, weekly, in the hall built for that 
purpose in Ingram-street. On one week during the 
winter season, is a dancing assembly, and, on the 
next, a card one, and so on alternately throughout 
the whole season. The first dancing assembly is on 
the Queen’s birth-day. 

The Gentlemen’s Subscription Concerts are held 
in the Assembly-rooms. They are well attended, 
and supported by the first vocal as well as instru¬ 
mental performers in the country. 

In April, 1818, the members of the Glasgow Mu¬ 
sical Fund, which was instituted in 174-5, united in 
giving a grand concert in aid of the association, and 
which they intend to continue annually. Judging 
from the first specimen, it bids fair to become a 
yearly treat to musical amateurs. 

There are also a number of other concerts held 
during the winter, by the teachers of music, in dif¬ 
ferent parts of the city. 

A number of the citizens becoming partial to the 
healthful exercise of bowling, two greens have been 
prepared for their accommodation, one situated in 
Sauchiehall-road, and another in Hutchesontown.

Early introduction of Manufactures. 

MANUFACTURES were introduced at an early 
period into Scotland. Her people, under regulations 
of David I., manufactured the wool of their flocks, 
their flax, and their leather. Every village, then, 
had its smiths, tanners, shoemakers; and every town, 
its dyers, goldsmiths, and armourers. Salt-works 
also had become objects of great attention, because 
they furnished an ample revenue to the king and 
the nobles; and, during the same reign, water-mills 
were subjected to tithes, and tenants restricted to 
grind at particular mills. Before the age of Alex¬ 
ander II., who died in 1249, wind-mills had been 
universally introduced, and Glasgow, at an earlier 
date, had become noted for its malt-kilns. At a 
subsequent period, a manufactory of plaids, and 
works for making soap and ropes, were established 
and carried on with success. The sugar-baking 
business was, so early as the year 1669, carried on 
in Glasgow to a very considerable extent. Soon 
afterwards the trade of tanning was entered into, 
and manufactories of coarse linens were established. 






The manufacture of Muslins, Glass, &amp;c. introduced into Glasgow. 257 


A spirit of industry and enterprise now manifested 
itself in the different classes of this rising commu¬ 
nity. But the Union produced a conspicuous pro¬ 
gress in the extension and improvement of the ma¬ 
nufactures of this city, as well as of the kingdom. 
The manufacture of linens, lawns, cambrics, and 
other articles of similar fabric, continued the staple 
of Glasgow, till superseded by the introduction of 
muslins. In 1730 the manufacture of green glass 
bottles commenced; the work-house was erected on 
the spot where the Jamaica-street bottle-house now 
stands. At this period, so limited was the demand 
for bottles, that the workmen were employed for 
only four months in the year. A manufactory of 
flint-glass, or crystal, was established here in 1777 
by a company from Newcastle, which is still conti¬ 
nued by Mr. John Geddes, at Verreville, to the west 
of the city, who has brought this art to a state of 
great perfection, and brings forward for sale, in his 
warehouse, Argyle-street, specimens of this superb 
ware, not to be surpassed in the kingdom. In Glas¬ 
gow an incle-loom was first established. Mr. Alex¬ 
ander Harvey, a spirited citizen, at the risk of his 
life, brought over from Haerlem two incle-looms and 
a workman; by means of which he was, in 1732, 
enabled to introduce the manufacture of this article 
into his native city. The incle manufactory is still 
extensively prosecuted. 

Glasgow had the honour of introducing the art of 
type-founding into Scotland. The manufacture was 
begun, in the year 1743, by Mr. Alexander Wilson,

was ably and successfully carried on, and Professor 
Wilson lived to enjoy the advantageous results of 
unwearied industry and well directed talents. This 
foundry became the most celebrated, as it was nearly 
the most extensive, in Europe. This business is still 
continued by the Professor’s descendants, under the 
firm of Alexander Wilson &amp; Sons, on an extended 
scale, and with increased reputation. The exactness 
of the types, the beauty of their form, and the du¬ 
rability of the materials, give them a decided pre¬ 
ference. Mr. Jackson, author of the ‘ Four Ages/ 
and c Letters on Various Subjects/ confers the fol¬ 
lowing commendation on the Glasgow types: “ That 
the types of our modern splendid books, and most of 
the foreign as well, are not formed upon a scale of 
aliquot parts; so that the letters disagree with each 
other, and have, besides, an affected sharpness and 
precision, which nothing but the exactest proportion 
can excuse—that Caslon’s types are very perfect, but 
that in the Glasgow letter is united every desirable 
property, being by far the most beautiful of any yet 
invented.” 

Wrought on the same principles, and of equal 
execution in beauty and excellence, are the types of 
Mr. William Millar of Edinburgh, who, during nearly 
twenty years’ service in Messrs. Wilson’s works, ac¬ 
quired such perfection in his art as to be enabled 
to rival the best productions of his former respec¬ 
table employer. 


Privileges granted to the first Scottish Printers. 259 

Printing was invented about the middle of the 
fifteenth century, and the first books were printed, 
in 1450, at Mentz on the Rhine. It was intro¬ 
duced into England, in 1471, by William Caxton, 
who established a printing press at Westminster. 
The gallant James IV., a patron of all the liberal 
arts, encouraged the erection of one in Edinburgh, 
during 1507. * About the year 1630, printing 


* The following privilege by the king to Walter Chapman and Andro 
Millar, the first Scottish printers, is a document of some importance in the 
literary History of Scotland:—“ James, &amp;c. To al and sindrj our officiaris

was first executed in Glasgow by George Ander¬ 
son ; and in l66l he was succeeded by Robert 
Saunders &amp; Son. Robert Urie, in 1730, greatly 
extended the trade, and conferred celebrity on the 
seat of his business by the neatness, beauty, and ac¬ 
curacy, of the works which he printed. As he had 
hitherto surpassed all the printers north of the Tweed, 
he was, in his turn, to be eclipsed by the celebrated 
Robert and Andrew Foulis, natives of this city, who 
were appointed, about the year 1740, Printers to the 
University. These ingenious men brought to their 
art a classic taste, and an elegance of execution un¬ 
rivalled; while the beauty and accuracy of their 
editions of the Greek and Roman classics have not 
been excelled by the best productions of the most 
celebrated of the continental presses. For thirty 
years, the two brothers continued to produce a 
series of classics, well known to the literary world 
as faithful and elegant transcripts of the treasures of 
Greek and Roman learning. With the laudable inten¬ 
tion of giving encouragement to the fine arts in Scot¬ 
land, these enterprising men, in 1753, founded an 
Academy in the city. But the scheme was too ex¬ 
pensive for individuals, and the public spirit had not

The only publications known to have issued from the press of Chapman 
and Millar, are a collection of pamphlets, chiefly metrical Romances and 
Ballads, in 1508, of which an imperfect copy is preserved in the Advocates 
Library; and the Scottish Service Book, including the Legends of the 
Scottish Saints, commonly called the Breviary of Aberdeen, in 1509; of 
which the copies are excessively rare.

yet received such a direction as to produce a proper 
support of so noble an institution. On the death, 
therefore, of its founders, in 1776, the Academy was 
dissolved. It must be recorded, however, that the 
Glasgow Academy had been, during fifteen years , 
established previously to the formation of that in 
Somerset-house, London. 

Delft ware was first made in Glasgow in 1748 ; 
but though the ware produced is of excellent qua¬ 
lity, yet the manufactory of it has not been extended 
in proportion to the facilities which the situation of 
the city affords, from the cheapness of fuel, and the 
easy command of water conveyance in the direction 
of every market. The attention of the inhabitants 
having been early and strongly directed to other 
objects, is the cause which must be assigned for the 
limited extent of this trade. Bricks, tiles, and all 
the coarser kinds of pottery are made here in abun- 
dance; as are also hats, nun’s thread, cotton and 
worsted stockings, and gloves of all kinds. Large 
quantities of shoes and saddles are fabricated here, 
and exported to America. There are also manufac¬ 
tories of tobacco and snuff. 

The first printfield belonging to the city was, about 
the year 1742, set down at Pollokshaws, a village 
three miles south from Glasgow, by Messrs. Ingram 
&amp; Co. A brewery was erected, in 1762, at Ander- 
stown, which is still conducted by Mr. Cowan. A 
very extensive one was constructed by Mr. Robert 
Struthers at the Green-head, another built by Messrs. 
Tennent, in the Well-park, at the foot of the Craigs- 






262 The Cotton Trade. 

park rocks, besides which, others have been esta¬ 
blished not less extensive. Their annual produce 
is estimated at above j£80,000. Several extensive 
bleachfields have been opened in the vicinity of the 
town. Oil of vitriol, which, previously to 1750, was 
imported from England and Holland, is now made 
here in considerable quantities. 

It was the year 1775 which ushered in that ma¬ 
nufacture which has become the staple of this city, 
given importance to Glasgow, and conferred wealth 
on its citizens. It was the discovery of Arkwright 
which crowned the attempts of the manufacturers of 
cotton-wool with success, and caused the extension 
of the manufacture of muslin in this country. * The 
cambric and lawn manufacturers of Glasgow em¬ 
barked with spirit in the undertaking, and were as 
successful as the most sanguine expectations could 
have anticipated. A tax proposed to be laid on cotton, 
and which threatened to crush the infant manufac¬ 
ture, was by the able exertions of Patrick Colquhoun, 
Esq. at that time a merchant in Glasgow, and one of 
its most spirited citizens, abandoned as improper. 
For these disinterested services, he received the 
thanks of his townsmen, and the manufacturers of 
cotton presented him with services of plate. The 
progress of the cotton manufactures was soon rapid 
and extensive. Numerous spinning works were es¬ 
tablished, and the different fabrics of cotton-cloth

who warped a muslin web in Scotland.

were executed with taste and spirit. Dying and 
printing of linen and cotton-cloths, a branch of ma¬ 
nufacture which had hitherto been conducted on 
a limited scale, was now greatly extended. A num¬ 
ber of other manufactures of linen, woollen, iron, and 
other articles subsidiary to more important branches, 
were successfully prosecuted, and continued to in¬ 
crease with the growing importance of the city. 

A cud-bear manufacture was established, in 1777, 
by the late Mr. George Mackintosh. This dye-stuff 
is made from rock-moss, and is chiefly used in 
colouring woollen and silk goods. Turkey red is 
also dyed here in great perfection. It was first 
begun, in 1785, by a Mr. Papillon, from Rouen, 
under the patronage of Mr. Mackintosh and the late 
philanthropic Mr. David Dale. Here are likewise 
two manufactories of an article which is found to be 
an excellent substitute for sugar of lead, in the pro¬ 
cesses of dying and printing goods. 

Belonging to this city there are fifty-two cotton- 
mills. The spindles in these are calculated at 
511,200, and the capital employed may be esti¬ 
mated at £1,000,000. Two mills were sometime 
since erected in Hutchesontown, at an expense of 
£32,000 each. Of the extent of the cotton manu¬ 
facture, which has been the source of immense 
wealth, and the means of occupation to numbers of 
the industrious of this city and suburbs, no positive 
estimate can be given ; but some facts may be men¬ 
tioned to illustrate its importance. There are be¬ 
longing to Glasgow eighteen works for weaving by 





264 Calendering-houses, Steam-engine makers, &amp;c. 

steam-power, containing 2800 looms, which produce 
8400 pieces of cloth weekly; and the number of 
hand-looms employed by the manufacturers of this 
city, has been declared, on the authority of those 
versant in these matters, to be about 32,000. Con¬ 
nected with the city there are eighteen calico print¬ 
ing works; to which has been lately added, by Henry 
Monteith, Bogle &amp; Co., an extensive manufacture of 
Bandana handkerchiefs: the cloth for which being 
dyed a fine Turkey red, the pattern is afterwards 
produced by discharging the colour of the figure by 
a chemical process. In the city, seventeen calender¬ 
ing-houses are established, containing 39 calenders 
moved by steam, which finish upwards of four times 
the quantity of work performed by the same ma¬ 
chinery, when moved by horses. One of these 
houses contains 119 hands; and the whole of the 
establishments can calender, in one day, 118,000 
yards, besides dressing 116,000 not calendered, and 
glaze 30,000. 

In the city and suburbs there are nine iron 
foundries, and several extensive works for making 
steam-engines, with the machinery requisite for the 
different manufactures. Employed in the different 
processes of manufacture, there are in Glasgow and 
its immediate vicinity, seventy-three steam-engines 
of from four to fifty horse power. For this most 
useful engine our country is indebted to Mr. Watt, 
a native of Glasgow, now of Soho ; who, though not 
the original inventor, has yet by his improvements 
rendered it his own. In 1768 he obtained a patent 







Manufactories of wood-work, paper, &amp;c. 265 

for his engine; ancl by an act of parliament obtained 
in 1775, the name of Mr. Boulton of Birmingham 
was, in consequence of their joint improvements, 
conjoined with his, and the patent extended for 
twenty-five years. 

Wood-work is also extensively done, in all its 
branches, within the city; particularly that of the 
cabinet-makers, which is, in general, executed in a 
style of exquisite elegance and taste. 

Paper of every kind is likewise made here of very 
excellent quality, both for writing and printing. 

At Port-Dundas and Bridgetown there are distil¬ 
leries in which whisky is made in great quantities. 

Whin and freestone abound in the neighbourhood, 
where there is also plenty of clay for making bricks, 
tiles, and common pottery. On the east of the town, 
coal is found in great abundance, forming five dif¬ 
ferent strata, from 3 to 4^ feet in thickness. 

Such is a short account of the leading branches of 
the manufactures of this city. Sketches of others 
of less importance and extent might have been intro¬ 
duced ; but as their combined influence on society is 
inconsiderable, it has been deemed unnecessary to 
enter more minutely into a detail of them.

Commerce of &lt;@las(joto. 


“ Art plies his oar, and Commerce pours her horn.” 

Antiquity of commerce in Scotland. 

SHIPS have, in all countries, been used for the 
purposes of war and emigration, before they were 
employed in facilitating the more genial objects of 
commerce and trade. In a. d. 719* a furious naval 
action took place off Ardanesse, on the coast of Ar- 
gyle, between Selvach the chief of Lorn, and Duncan 
chief of the clans of Kintyre and Argyle. The com¬ 
mercial chronologists, Anderson and Macpherson, 
have adopted the opinion that, the Scots had a fishery 
at home, and a traffic with the Dutch, so early as 
a.d. 836; but the manners of the one country, and 









Privileges granted to commercial towns. 267 

the state of society in the other, throw doubts on its 
probability. Scone seems to have been one of the 
earliest commercial towns in Scotland. Alexander I. 
granted to its monastery the custom of ships coming 
to it. Perth also had a foreign trade in those early 
times. Stirling followed next to these; and, to Dun¬ 
fermline, David I. conferred the customary dues paid 
by ships coming to the port of Inveresk. This prince 
also gave to the Bishop, the tenth of the cane * of all 
ships which should come to Aberdeen; and his grant 
was confirmed by Malcolm IV. But the spirit of 
enterprise yet slumbered, and the extension of com¬ 
merce was cramped by the monopolies of the monks, 
who were then the only guild-brothers. The burghers 
of Dunbarton tried to exclude the men of Glasgow 
from trading in that shire, till Alexander III. inter¬ 
posed. Other places entertained the same narrow 
prejudices, and entered into similar frivolous contests. 
The Flemings were, in those ages, the great traders 
of the European world, and had already sent colon¬ 
ists into England, Wales, Berwick-on-Tweed, St. 
Andrew’s, and other towns on the coast of Scotland. 
Previously, also, to the death of Alexander III., on

eause.

263 Branches of commerce entered into by Glasgow merchants. 

March 16th, 1286, a trade had been opened to Gas¬ 
cony for the importation of wine and corn. Fishing, 
hitherto, was only practised in the lakes, rivers, and 
along the flat shores of the ocean; and the products, 
of whatever extent, seem to have been consumed at 
home. 

When Edward I. invaded Scotland, in 1300, he 
carried with him his nets and his fishers to supply 
his table. The succession war must have destroyed 
the shipping, which Edward I. tried to embargo in 
1294. History has recorded the building, during 
that year, of a large vessel at Inverness. But the 
citizens of Glasgow were hitherto unknown in the 
commercial world. Their earliest branch of trade 
was the curing and exportation of salmon caught in 
the Clyde, which, so early as the year 1420, they 
had carried to a considerable extent. From the mid¬ 
dle of the 16th to the beginning of the 17th century, 
they appear to have had vessels at sea, which made 
attacks on the shipping of England ; * for, in 1546, 
an order was issued by the privy council of Scotland, 
that the ships belonging to Scotland (and those of 
Glasgow are particularly mentioned) should not an¬ 
noy “ the ships belonging to the uncle of our sove¬ 
reign lady the queen.” T owards the conclusion of the 
17th century, they exported, chiefly to France, their 
salmon and herrings, and imported brandy, salt, and

pieces of ordnance, was fitted out from the Clyde, in the reign of Charles 
II., to cruise against the Dutch. 





Trade opened to America and the West Indies. 269 

wines. Their ships also, at this period, navigated 
the Baltic, whence they brought home iron, and other 
northern wares. In 1667, a concern was entered 
into by several of the citizens, to carry on the trade 
of whale fishing; the business was however unsuc¬ 
cessful, and after losing the money sunk by them in 
the speculation, the partners abandoned it. Their 
spirit of enterprise, at the same time, prompted them 
to adventure boldly in the expedition of Darien, 
which, after exciting hopes that were never to be 
realized, was prematurely blasted by the invidious 
jealousy of the Spaniards, and the opposition, at 
Hamburgh and Jamaica, of the illiberal government 
of King William, a splendid monument of whose 
patriotic policy still decorates the cross of this city. 

The Union of the kingdoms, in 1707, offered, 
however, new views to the traders of Glasgow. The 
markets of America and the West Indies were then 
opened to their ambition, and the vessels that carried 
out their goods brought tobacco in return. Glasgow 
soon became a mart for tobacco, and the chief me¬ 
dium through which the farmers-general of France 
were supplied with that article. The citizens carried 
on this trade in vessels chartered from the English 
ports; and it was not till 1718, that a ship built on 
the Clyde, the property of Glasgow, crossed the 
Atlantic; this was quickly followed by others of 
increased size and value. The tobacco trade of the 
city soon attracted much notice, and its prosperous 
state at length excited the envy of the merchants in 
London, Bristol, Liverpool, and Whitehaven, who 

z 3

entered into a perfidious combination for its discour¬ 
agement and ruin. For this purpose, they accused 
the Glasgow merchants of frauds against the revenue, 
first before the commissioners of customs in London, 
afterwards by petitions to the lords of the treasury, 
and, when both these measures failed, by a direct 
application to the House of Commons. Though no 
fraud against the revenue could be established, yet 
the powerful influence of the English merchants pre¬ 
vailed, by procuring the appointment of officers at 
Greenock and Port-Glasgow, in whose power it was 
to teaze and harass the Glasgow traders, by the re¬ 
strictions they imposed on the commerce of tobacco. 
The operations of the merchants thus cramped, the 
trade declined and languished, till in 1735 it began 
to assume its former vigour and prosperity. Subse¬ 
quently to 1750, a new mode of conducting the trade 
with America, by sending out factors to dispose of 
the goods on credit, instead of bartering them, was 
adopted by the merchants. Its increase, consequent¬ 
ly, became very rapid and extensive, so that, in 1772, 
out of 90,000 hogsheads of tobacco imported into 
Britain, 45,000 belonged to Glasgow. This trade 
engrossed almost all the whole capital and commer¬ 
cial enterprise of Glasgow; and any manufactures 
that were carried on, were chiefly of articles adapted 
to the demands of the Virginia market; the supply 
of that state with European goods, and taking off the 
produce of its soil in return, were held by the mer¬ 
chants of this city alone.—About the same period, 
John Glassford, Esq., a merchant of this city, had. 




Articles chiefly imported and exported. 271 


at one time, Irventy-five ships with their cargoes, all 
his own property, and traded for more than half a 
million sterling per annum. 

The ill advised and perverted councils of the British 
cabinet, which led to war with America, and termi¬ 
nated in the declaration of independence by that 
country, were fatal to the commercial interests of 
Glasgow, and proved the ruin of many of its mer¬ 
chants, to whom large sums were due by the Amer¬ 
icans. The commercial spirit is enterprising and 
active, and that of Glasgow, shut out from its usual 
field of speculation, America, soon discovered new 
resources. To the markets of the West Indies, and 
the continent of Europe, the commerce of Clyde was 
soon directed; and the West India trade is now the 
source of wealth, and the chief field for the commerce 
of Glasgow. 

The principal articles for exportation from the 
Clyde, to America and the West Indies, are British 
manufactures, coals, fish, salt, and similar commo¬ 
dities. To the continent, besides her manufactures, 
Glasgow sends raw and refined sugar, coffee, cotton, 
rum, and other productions of the western hemis¬ 
phere. From the West Indies and America, she 
imports coffee, cotton, sugar, pearl and wood ashes, 
rum, wheat, flour, mahogany, staves, and fruits; 
from Spain and Portugal, wines and other produc¬ 
tions of these countries; and, from the Baltic, wood, 
iron, flax, hemp, pitch, tar, Russia leather, and wheat. 
To Ireland, goods made in the city are sent, and 
hides, grain, salted beef, butter, meal, linens, and

other commodities of that country,, are received in 
return. 

In January 1817, the Anna Robinson, a country 
built ship, arrived at Greenock, the first from India 
since the removal of the monopoly. Several of the 
first mercantile houses in Glasgow have embarked in 
this trade, which bids fair to open a wide and lu¬ 
crative field for the manufactures of the city, and a 
source of opulence to its merchants. 

Glasgow has been raised by these diversified 
branches of trade, to a high rank among commercial 
cities; her citizens have become rich and opulent, 
her public buildings numerous and magnificent, and 
her benevolent institutions splendid, and extensive 
in usefulness.

274 Inns, Mail Coaches, &amp;c. 




THE Inns and Taverns in Glasgow are numerous, 
and adapted to the accommodation of all ranks of 
travellers, besides private lodgings, of various con¬ 
venience and expense. 

Mail and other Coaches. It is a curious fact, 
that, about 140 years ago, the Jirst Stagecoach com¬ 
menced running between Glasgow and Edinburgh. 
This was drawn by six horses, contained six inside 
passengers, and was to run once or twice a week as 
encouragement offered. At the same time, in order 
to promote so novel a design, a contract, dated Au¬ 
gust 6, 1678, was entered into by the magistrates of 
this city and William Hoorn of Edinburgh, which, 
among other things, provided, “ that the burgesses 
of this Burgh were to have seats in preference to all 
others.” The history of this mighty adventure is 
now lost; but the following account of the number 
of these vehicles of public intercourse and conveni¬ 
ence, may exhibit a comparative state of the progress 
of manners produced by the vigour of commercial 
enterprize. From Glasgow run, daily, one mail for 
London, and two for Edinburgh; and fourteen other 
coaches, once or twice a day, for Edinburgh, Kil¬ 
marnock, Ayr, Carlisle, Dumfries, Greenock, Perth, 
Hamilton, Dunbarton, Paisley, &amp;c. The city is 
likewise supplied with street-coaches and sedan- 
chairs.

Lucretius. 

MAN receives the distinctive modifications of his 
physical and moral character from the atmospheric 
temperature and topical phenomena of the region 
wherein he dwells. Places low, humid, and warm, 
exhibit a race of people dull, feeble, phlegmatic, 
listless, having large persons, flabby and ungraceful. 
Enamoured of peace and repose, they are uninvigo¬ 
rated by the operations of an active life, and ob¬ 
noxious to all the varieties of catarrhal, cutaneous, 
and lymphatic disease. Such are the goiters and 
cretins of the Piedmontese valleys; a stupid progeny 
and imbecile, overwhelmed with indolence, incapable

of sentiment or action, and enjoying perception only 
of animal desire. How different was the character of 
the valligenous tribes from that of the other ancient 
Greeks! Never did iEtolia, Boeotia, Arcadia, Mes- 
senia, or Thessaly, burn one grain of incense on the 
altars of the Arts and Philosophy. These asylums of 
oracles, sorcery, and enchantment, beheld the splen¬ 
dour of Athens, but caught not a ray of its blaze. 

Mountaineers, however, and the dwellers of re¬ 
gions dry, elevated, and airy, possess the animal and 
intellectual energies in a degree more perfect and 
sublime. They are athletic, bold, active, prompt, 
patient. Possessing eminently the manly virtues of 
fortitude, courage, and patriotism, they are restless 
and irascible, fond of the chase, of war, and of inde¬ 
pendence. Capable of matchless perseverance, and 
alive to sentiments of true glory, they excel in science 
and triumph in battle. Children of the Appenines, 
the Samnites long resisted the Roman arms. The 
Asturian and Cantabrian highlanders asserted their 
freedom in defiance of Augustus, and in aftertimes 
supported the shock of the Goths and Saracens. 
Amid the recesses of Lebanon, the Druses and Ma- 
ronites preserve a wild freedom against myriads of 
foes. The Andes and uplands of Chili maintain the 
brave Indians whom Spain has never been able to 
subjugate. From the alpine glens of Immaus and 
Caucasus, Mithridates drew his armies, which the le¬ 
gions of Italy could with difficulty repress. The 
mountaineers of Albion are renowned over the world 
for the excellency of their genius, and the deeds of

their valorous enterprise. Cyrus conducted the con¬ 
querors of Asia from the ridges of Taurus and the 
Caramanian wilds. From the hills of Macedon, A- 
lexander led a handful of highland warriors to subdue 
the universe. 

Glasgow, although situated only eight miles farther 
south than Moscow, enjoys, with a regular vicissitude 
of the seasons, a climate as genial as that of the cen¬ 
tral regions of Europe. Its situation, though rather 
low, is not humid: it involves a moderate intermix¬ 
ture of both dry and wet weather. Placed on the 
southern aspect of an open plain, and exposed to 
the bracing action of the sea-breeze from the west, 
the atmospheric temperature and local circumstances 
of the city are favourable to the expansion of health 
and activity, and to the growth of that energy of 
spirit, which has raised the town to opulence and 
fame.

on the personal and intellectual constitution of the inhabi¬ 
tants. 

The estimate of the temperature of London, by Mr. 
Kirwan, for eight years, is 52°; the greatest cold is 20°, and 
has place in January ; the greatest heat 81°, and generally 
in July. Proportionally to its latitude, London is therefore 
exposed to more intense cold in winter than Edinburgh, 
whose mean temperature in January is 34° 5 f , and that of 
the metropolis 35° 9'. At Glasgow, it is 33° 15'. 


MORTALITY BILL. 

PRELIMINARY SKETCHES. 

The human race is understood to be renewed every 
thirty-three years. Supposing three generations for 
an age, and the world to be only five thousand se¬ 
ven hundred years old, there will have been 171 
generations since the creation, 124 since the deluge, 
and 53 since the commencement of the Christian aera. - 
If thirty-three years be allotted to each generation, 
then 33,333,333 individuals die yearly; 91,324 
daily; 3803 hourly; 65 every minute; and one 
every second. In one year 37,037,037 persons are 
bom; 101,471 in a day; 4228 in an hour; 70 in a 
minute; and one in a second. The most ancient 
families are unable to retrace their descent to more 
than thirty generations. 

Out of 1000 infants, 300 nursed by their mothers, 
500 by nurses, die. Ou\ of the same number of

children who are born within the same period, only 
740 will survive at the termination of a year; in 
three years 600; in five, 584; in ten, 540; in thirty, 
446; in sixty, 226; in eighty, 49; in ninety, 11; in 
ninety-five, 9; and in ninety-seven, 1. Among 115 
deaths, is 1 of a woman in child-bed: only 1 in 400 
die in labour. Natural small-pox destroys 3 in 100, 
the inoculated only 1 in 300; death from vaccination 
is extremely rare. More girls than boys die of the 
natural small-pox. Only 11 persons in 3126 live 
100 years. Longevity is greatest in elevated situa¬ 
tions. One hundred women die for 108 men. Sixty 
years is the probable duration of a woman's life, and 
married women live longest.— In March, August, 
and September, deaths are most numerous: in No¬ 
vember, December, and February, fewest. Out of 
1000 deaths, are 249 in winter, 289 in spring, 225 
in summer, and 237 in autumn. The half of all 
born die before the age of seventeen. The propor¬ 
tion of the old who die in cold weather, to those in 
warm, is seven to four. Of 27 35 infants who die 
very young, 1292 expire on the first day after birth; 
the remainder in their first month. The healthiest 
children are born in January, February, and March. 
—Married women are to all the female inhabitants 
of a country as 1 to 3; married men to all the other 
males as 3 to 5. The greatest number of births is in 
February and March, which answers to May and 
June. Twin-births are to single as 1 to 65; mar¬ 
riages, as 175 to 1000. In the country, 4 children 
are born to each marriage; in towns, 3|. Widows

are to widowers as 3 to 1; remarried widows to wi¬ 
dowers as 4 to 5; widows to the whole inhabitants 
as 5 to 51; widowers, as 1 to 15. One fourth of 
mankind lives in towns, three-fourths in villages. 
Of 1000 living men, 28 deaths yearly are allowed.

* The extent of London from west to east is about 7£, its breadth from 
north to south nearly 5 miles. The circumference of the whole, allowing 
for various inequalities in the extension of streets, cannot be less than 30 
miles. Hence it may be fairly estimated, that the buildings of London 
cover at least 18 square miles, with the deduction of the Thames, which ex¬ 
tends nearly 7 miles in length, and about a quarter in breadth—By the cen¬ 
sus in 1811, the population amounted to 1,090,104 persons, for the cities of 
London, Westminster, and suburbs.

urbs, which we believe to be the case, the whole decrease 
may be attributed to the mildness in that particular com¬ 
plaint.

Commencement of the route to Loeh-Lomond. 


Having concisely endeavoured to make the 
Stranger acquainted with the history, together with 
the local, political, and commercial state of Glasgow, 
it may be agreeable to offer a few such descriptive 
sketches as will facilitate and enliven the progress 
of those, whose object may be to explore and admire 
the magnificent scenery embosomed by the Caledo¬ 
nian hills. From the city of Glasgow, therefore, 
the Traveller, with “ future ” his companion, 
will commence his journey towards the romantic 
land of the west. 

Having passed through Anderston, the road, by a 
short and agreeable walk, conducts to Partick on 
the Kelvin, a fine stream, made interesting by the 
diversity of its accompaniments, whether considered 
as adapted to usefulness or pleasure. At the east 
end of the village the road branches off to the right, 
and crosses the river by a strong new bridge, over¬ 
looked by Gilmour-hill, the seat of Mr. Robert Bo¬ 
gle, a spacious mansion, surrounded by young and 







286 Gentlemen’s seats on the banks of the Clyde. 

thriving woods. On the left are the mills belonging 
to the Incorporation of bakers of Glasgow; from 
this point the river is seen spreading into expansive 
sheets, or murmuring in frequent falls. The ancient 
bridge, in the same direction, engages the atten¬ 
tion, together with the venerable ruins of the former 
abode of the Episcopal dignitaries of Glasgow. 

The traveller now proceeds through a luxuriant 
plain, having the Clyde on the left, and, on the 
right, many neat villas and seats. Among these, 
Jordan-hill, the property of Mr. Smith, is conspicu¬ 
ous from its situation, and celebrated for the suc¬ 
cessful temerity of a former possessor. This was a 
Captain Crawford, who, during the early part of the 
reign of James VI., surprised the fortress of Dun¬ 
barton, carried it by escalade, and made most of the 
garrison prisoners. Scotstown, the residence of Mr. 
Oswald, is, soon after, observed on the left, whence 
there is a fine view of the opposite banks of the 
Clyde, adorned by several mansions, among which, 
Elderslie, the seat of Mr. Spiers, demands consider¬ 
ation from its local beauties. The ancient borough 
of Renfrew is, at the same time, seen amid the sur¬ 
rounding trees, at a short distance from the river, 
with which it communicates by a small canal. Pro¬ 
ceeding through the little village of Yocker, remark¬ 
able only for its large whisky distillery, the passenger 
soon obtains a view of Renfield, the dwelling of Mr. 
Campbell of Blythswood, situated beyond the river, 
on an angle formed by a junction of the White Cart 
with the Clyde. At some distance onward, and

upon the right, stands Garscadden-gate, a Gothic 
appendage to a modern mansion, much more roman¬ 
tic than appropriate. Beyond where the canal cros¬ 
ses the road at Dalmuir Paper-works and Bleach- 
fields, is Mr. Collins’s house, on the right, then 
Mountblow, belonging to Mr. Bowie, on the same 
side, and, a little farther on, a prospect is obtained 
of Semple-house, the seat of Lord Semple, delight¬ 
fully situated on the southern side of the river. 

The eminence distinguished by the name of Dal¬ 
notter-hill is now to be asceilded by the traveller, 
when one of the noblest prospects, which topogra¬ 
phy has delineated or imagination pictured, will ex¬ 
pand before him. 

The Clyde here spreads into an ample and majestic 
stream, producing, in the landscape, a most pictu¬ 
resque effect, while the reception of the Great Canal 
into its bosom, at no great distance, adds a singular 
diversity to the view. In front, the semi-insulated 
rock of Dunbarton abruptly rears its rugged head 
above the waters; and, on the right, the ruined fort 
of Dunglas with its ivied fragments, remain, on its 
jutting point, the solitary wrecks of primeval power. 
Nearer, and beyond the river, stands Erskine, the 
seat of Lord Blantyre, pleasantly situated amid ex¬ 
tensive woods. This charming spot, till 1(538, be¬ 
longed to the illustrious house of Marr, whose family 
name it still retains. The same side is diversified 
by an irregular coast, covered with brushwood, 
through which the rude rocks are seen dipping 
their bases into the stream, or raising their mossy

passing vessels, enliven the scene, which is bounded 
on the west by the mountains of Argyleshire, top¬ 
ped with their azure clouds. 

Descending from this magic spot, the delighted 
journeyer will soon arrive at the village of Kilpa¬ 
trick, the termination of the Roman Wall. Here, 
may be contemplated the tombstone of its patron- 
saint in the place of graves, and his stone, seen peer¬ 
ing from afar above the ebbing waters of the Clyde. 
—-In the same neighbourhood are the Dalnotter 
Iron-works, erected beneath the protuberant brow 
of the Kilpatrick hills. 

The curious are invited to walk about a mile and 
a half, out of the road, from this place, to view the 
remains of a Roman bridge over a brook, at the vil¬ 
lage of Duntocher, and in the line of Antoninus's 
Wall. * It is supported by rugged rocks, over 
which falls a pretty cascade: and an inscription 
records that it has been preserved from dilapidation 


* In July 1812, there was found in the farm of Braidfield, near Graham’s 
Dyke, in the parish of Old Kilpatrick, a stone, in the highest state of pre¬ 
servation, upon which is the inscription,

There are four figures upon it, two males and two females; one of whom

by Lord Blantyre, who repaired it in 1772. Near 
this bridge a Roman Sudorium, or hot-bath, was 
discovered in 1775, and in the same vicinity is the 
site of a fort constructed by that vigorous people? 
On one of the stones taken from this, and preserved 
in the wall of a cottage, the letters N. E. R. O. still 
remain very legible. 

Leaving Kilpatrick, the road passes Bowling-Bay 
at the junction of the Canal with the Clyde. Em¬ 
bowered in woods, on the right, is Glenarbach, a mo¬ 
dern house, the property of Mr. Robertson; then is 
Friskyhall, Mr. Smith, singularly situated between the 
highway and the river. The next remarkable object 
is the ruin of Dunglass-castle, standing on the point 
of its cognominal promontory. It is conjectured that 
this place was a Roman station, occupied for com¬ 
manding the fords of the Clyde. In the time of 
Oliver Cromwell it was fortified for the same pur¬ 
pose ; but it was blown up, in 1640, by the treach¬ 
ery of an English boy, page to the Earl of Hadding¬ 
ton, who, with many persons of high rank, were at 
the same time destroyed. The ruins, though not 
very considerable, are not destitute of interest or 
attraction. On the right, is Auchintorlie, or Silver - 
batik, the seat of Mr. Buchanan, who has erected, 
towards the west, a rural temple on the conspicuous 
summit of a woody height. On the same side, at a 
short distance forward, opens the streamy dell in 
which stands the House and Printfield of Milton, 
belonging to Mr. P. Mitchell. This is an impres¬ 
sive seclusion, in which the ingenuity and powers

of art are exhibited in strong contrast to the wild 
beauties and romantic majesty of nature. 

Dunbuc, the hill of roes , overlooking the right, 
next rears its threatening brow; from the summit 
of which the magnificent prospect will amply repay 
the toil of ascending its rugged sides. A short walk 
winding round its base conducts to the borough of 
Dunbarton, situated at the confluence of the Leven 
and the now-expanded Clyde. 

Dunbarton-castle is celebrated for its antiquity, 
for the feats of which it has been the scene, and for 
the singular conformation of its forted rock. This 
seems to have been a retreat of the primeval Britons, 
and probability has pointed it out as having been 
the birth-place of Ossian’s Cathlin, the soft-handed 
daughter of Cathmol, by the streams of Clutha. It 
was also the Hall of Reuthamir’s race, of car-borne 
Carthon chief of Balclutha’s walls of towers, the son 
of Moina of the dark blue eyes and Clessammor of 
roaring Lora, who ignorantly slew the heroic war¬ 
rior while he fought as the strength of a thousand 
streams. From a munition of the first inhabitants, 
the place was converted by the Romans into a fort 
named by them Theodosia, which in aftertimes is 
recognised in the appellation of Aldcluith, the rocky 
height on the Clyde. When the Britons of Strath¬ 
clyde resumed their independence, it became their 
capital, and the frequent object of attack by the 
Northumbrian Saxons, and the predatory crews 
of the North. It was, probably, the Penrhyn-Rhe- 
onydd of Merddin and the Caledonian Druids before 




Antiquity of Dunbarton-castle as a fortress. 291 

they were expelled by Rhydderech Hael, after his 
conversion to Christianity in the sixth century, by 
some Culdee from Iona, when he became the pro¬ 
tector of Kentigern, the celebrated patron-saint of 
Glasgow. When the Vale of Clyde became subject 
to the Scots, they changed its designation to that of 
Dun-Briton, the fortified hill of the Britons, which, 
in the corrupted form of Dunbarton, it still retains. 

The entrance into this fortress is by a gate on the 
south-east. Within the rampart by which it is de¬ 
fended, are the guard-house, and lodgings for the 
officers. From thence, to that part of the rock where 
it divides, the ascent is by a long flight of stone 
steps. Here is a battery, barracks for the garrison, 
and a well of excellent water. At the foot of the 
first ascent is, also, a small cistern, in which a com¬ 
mon trout existed upwards of thirty years. On the 
lower summit of the rock arc several batteries 
mounted with cannon. The access to the top of 
the other, which is the highest, is more difficult. 
This terminates in a peak, covered with a quantity 
of loose stones, which have been dignified with the 
appellation of Wallace’s seat , 

* ( Can the eye gaze upon the crumbling tower. 

And wake no traces of its former hour; 

Shall no tear start—no struggling sigh break loose.

hills, is in a great degree interesting, diversified and 
sublime. On the south, is seen the Clyde, studded 
with ships, while its banks are beautified with ver¬ 
dure and rich with cultivation, intersected by wood¬ 
lands, and embellished by elegant villas. Towards 
the north and west, the river spreads into an ample 
Frith, on both sides exhibiting prospects indicative 
of happiness, fertility, industry, and wealth. On 
the north is the town of Dunbarton, and part of 
the river Leven, winding through a rich country, 
and fertilizing its delightful vale, while Ben-Lo- 
mond, of majestic height and grandeur, rears its 
“ cloud-capt ” summit far above all the circumam¬ 
bient hills. The double-headed rock of Dunbarton 
is 560 feet high, a mile in circumference at the base, 
and is removed about the same distance from any 
other elevated ground. Some parts of it have mag¬ 
netic powers, and these were oecoi’tainod and marked 
out with paint, by the late Professor Anderson of 
Glasgow College. Tradition ascribes its origin to 
the wrath of some hags, whose resentment prompted 
them to tear the huge mass from the side of a moun¬ 
tain, and to hurl it at the head of the good St. Pa¬ 
trick, a native of Dunbarton, (called by himself and 
the monastic writers Bonaven Tabernise,) and the 
apostle of Ireland. The worthy saint, however, was 
fortunate enough to escape, and the bolt of ven¬ 
geance remains to this day, where it fell, a notable 
proof of the malignity of the Devil, and of the gi¬ 
gantic feats of his faithful servants. 

The town of Dunbarton, which contains a popu- 




Dunbarton, and its traffic. 293 

lation of upwards of 3000 inhabitants, is pleasantly 
situated near the confluence of the two rivers. By 
Alexander I. in 1221, it was erected into a royal 
borough. It has a good safe harbour, and possesses 
about 2000 tons of shipping, navigated by upwards 
of 70 seamen. Although enjoying several municipal 
privileges, it does not appear to have made much 
progress in the extension of its commerce and ma¬ 
nufactures. There are, however, three considerable 
glass-houses in it belonging to the Dunbarton Glass- 
work Company. Above 200 hands are employed in 
them, and they pay, annually, about £60,000 of 
duty to government. The traveller will find conve¬ 
nient lodgings in the place, and great diversity of 
scenery in the adjacent country. 

Having left this town, and crossed the river Le- 
ven, by a handsome bridge, the Tourist will leave 
the road to Helensburgh on the left, and pursue 
that, on the right, conducting to Loch-Lomond, per¬ 
haps the object and the limit of his journey. This 
will lead him along the banks of Leven’s “ transpa¬ 
rent stream ” amid scenery equally picturesque and 
charming, when his attention will soon be attracted 
by the Tuscan monument erected to the memory of 
Doctor Smollett, * by his cousin-german, James 
Smollett, Esq. of Bonhill. Upon it is a laboured 
epitaph, in Latin, descriptive of his genius and cha¬ 
racter. It was written partly by Dr. George Stuart, 


* The venerable birth-place of Smollett, on the banks of the Leven, de¬ 
faced by time and neglected by its proprietor, hastened to decay, and, in 
1812, •was taken down.

A short way beyond the monument is the village 
of Renton, occupied by above 1200 inhabitants; 
opposite to this, and on the other side of the river, 
is Levenside, the finely wooded residence of the late 
Lord Stonefield. Farther on, and between the road 
and the Leven, are Dalquhurn and Cordale, the pro¬ 
perty of Messrs. Stirling, who are owners of these 
two spacious printfields; and, with other Companies 
on the banks of the river, conduct business to a very 
great extent. Upon the same side is Bonhill, the 
seat of Mr. Smollett. A rural hamlet, of the same 
name, with its church and spire, is agreeably situa¬ 
ted on the eastern bank of the stream. Proceeding 
through the rising village of Alexandria, the road 
afterwards passes between Broomley, belonging to 
the Misses Alston, on the left, and Levenfield, the pro¬ 
perty of Messrs. Todd and Shortridge, on the right. 
Farther on, and at no great distance, upon the left, 
stands Tillicheun, the splendid seat of the late Mr. 
Stirling, now the property of Mr. Horrocks, built in 
the Gothic style, from an elegant design by Lugar, 
on a bold eminence, commanding a prospect diver¬ 
sified by a magnificent assemblage of wood, water, 
lawn, and distant country, and skirted on the north 
and south with rivulets, fringed by shady woods. 
Fronting this, from the eastern side of the river, 
stands Levenbank, belonging to Mr. Arthur. The 
road now conducts to Woodbank, the property of 
Miss Scott: opposite, is the ferry crossing the Leven 
to Balloch, at which place there is an annual fair for 
horses and black cattle, on the 17th of September. 





296 Killearn, the birth-place of George Buchanan. 

From this a road leads to Buchanan, the residence 
of the Duke of Montrose, and to Killearn, the native 
village of George Buchanan, celebrated for the ex¬ 
cellency of his genius as a poet and historian. An 
obelisk, 19 feet square at the base, and rising to the 
height of 103 feet, was erected, in 1788, to his me¬ 
mory, in the middle of the village, at an expense of 
.£500. The plan was suggested by the late Robert 
Dunmore, Esq., at a company assembled in the vi¬ 
cinity ; a subscription was immediately opened, and 
one of the number, the late Mr. Craig, furnished 
the architectural design as his contribution. In the 
foundation-stone a crystal bottle, hermetically sealed, 
was deposited. It contains a silver medal, on which 
is the inscription,

Leaving Woodbank a short way, the first view is 
obtained of Loch Lomond embosoming its woody 
isles. Near its southern extremity, and between it 
and the road, stands Cameron House, a seat of Mr. 
Smollett of Bonhill, commanding a fine view of the 
expanding lake. About a mile forward is Auchin- 
denan, now named Belretiro, the Beautiful Retreat , 
by its owner, a younger branch of the Smolletts; 
and nearly opposite this, and on the eastern side of 
the lake, stands Ardoch Castle, the property of Mr. 
John Buchanan of Ardoch, in a beautiful sloping

park, sheltered on the north-east by woods and hills, 
while the elegant mansion is thickly overshadowed 
by lofty trees. Leaving Arden, belonging to Mr. 
Buchanan, and Nether-Ross, on the left, the traveller 
will pass, upon the same side, Dun-Fion, the Hill 
of Fingal , probably, one of the ancient retreats of 
that illustrious Caledonian king. Soon after, a small 
bridge conducts across a stream, receiving its appel¬ 
lation from the vale of its source, Glen-Fruin, the 
Rushy or Sedgy Dale. This place is distinguished 
as having been the scene of a sanguinary conflict 
between the fierce clans of the Colquhouns and Mae¬ 
gregors, about the beginning of the 17th century. 

Passing between Mid-Ross and Auchintulloch, the 
traveller will arrive at Ross Lodge, the property of 
Mr. Colquhoun, situated on the margin of the loch, 
at the opening of Glenfmglas. From this, the road 
winds through an ample wood, and soon reaches 
Rossdoe, a modern mansion, built by Sir James Col¬ 
quhoun, on a rich peninsula projecting far into the 
lake, and commanding a delightful prospect of the 
surrounding scenery. In this vicinity is the tower 
of an ancient castle, formerly the seat of the chief of 
the clan. Leaving this charming spot, and winding 
through a majestic alley, the road approaches Cam- 
stradden, the property of Mr. Colquhoun. In its 
neighbourhood is a hill, in the side of which is a 
valuable quarry of blue slate, of which above five 
hundred thousand are annually exported to Stirling¬ 
shire, Glasgow, Greenock, and Paisley. Beyond this, 
is a bridge over the Water of Luss, which rushes in 
a furious torrent from the lofty mountains on the left.

and precipitates itself into the lake. It preeceps per 
saxa sonans spumantia rivus. 

Luss, situated on a headland, and surrounded by 
extensive woods, is soon after entered. It is a place 
of no great extent, but its site is delightful, being 
near the middle of the lake, and commanding a view 
of several islands, and of high mountains, indented 
with deep ravines. The church and manse stand 
close to the edge of the water, and are nearly con¬ 
cealed by shadowy trees. The inn of the village 
affords comfortable accommodation for the Traveller 
while he traverses this region of picturesque scenes, 
and enjoys their beauties. A boat will also be rea¬ 
dily obtained here, to visit and survey every part of 
the celebrated Lake of Isles. 

Loch-Lomond, whether regarded on account of 
its magnitude, or the diversity and grandeur of its 
scenery, is, doubtless, the most interesting and mag¬ 
nificent of all the British lakes. It is about thirty 
miles in length, and, though sometimes not more than 
one, is frequently eight or ten in breadth, covering 
an expanse of above 20,000 acres in extent. 

This far-famed lake is mentioned, about the end 
of the 14th century, by Richard of Cirencester, in 
his work on the ancient state of Britain. He de¬ 
nominates it Lyncalidor, which is its descriptive 
appellation, the Llyn-celydd-dwr of the primitive 
Britons, signifying The Lake of the Waters of the 
Woody Region. It is also more particularly noticed 
in the Chronicle of Tysilio, a Cambrian Annalist, 
who is supposed to have written in the 7th century. 
By him it is named Llwmonwy, the water of the

Bare or Unwooded Mountain. His account of it is 
curious. The Scots and Piets having shut up Hoel, 
the nephew of the chivalrous Arthur, in the fortress 
of Aldcluyd at the mouth of the Leven, this vigor¬ 
ous prince soon compelled them to retire, and chased 
many of them into Murief (Murray), while others 
took shelter in an island of the Lake of Llwmonwy, 
which he afterwards surrounded with a guard. “ In 
this lake,” says Tysilio, “ there are three hundred 
and sixty islands, and it receives as many rivers from 
the mountains of Prydyn, the waters whereof flow in 
one stream, called Lleven, into the sea. In each of 
these isles there is a large rock, and an eagle’s nest on 
each; and when these eagles assemble on one rock, 
and there scream, it is known that some calamity 
from abroad is coming on the country.” 

From the Stron-Hill, just above the village of 
Luss, a delightful view is obtained of the lake and 
its verdant isles. The Grampians, towering in rough 
gigantic masses, bound the distant prospect, while the 
wearied eye reposes with delight on the beauty and 
sublimity of the adjacent objects. Having indulged 
in this pleasurable survey, the stranger will descend 
the hill; and, while his pilot ferries him over to Inch 
Tavanach, he will be entertained with the usual tale 
of the “ fish without fins, waves without wind, and 
the floating island,” accompanied by the accustomed 
explanatory dissertation detailed in every tour. While 
he is so happily entertained, an opportunity may be 
taken to describe the principal islands, beginning 
with the most southern.

Description of its Isles. 


This, then, is Inch Murrin, one mile broad, and 
two in length. It is the property of the Duke of 
Montrose, is luxuriant and well wooded, and pas¬ 
tures about two hundred deer, under the care of a 
game-keeper, who, with his family, resides upon it. 
Near its west end stand the ruins of an old castle, 
formerly the residence of the Earls of Lennox; and 
in the same vicinity is a neat hunting-seat, erected, 
in 1793, by the present proprietor. Next to this 
is Grange, an islet of a mile in length, which, with 
Inch Torr, another of the same size, is thickly co¬ 
vered with woods of ancient oak. Inch Caillaich 
was, heretofore, the burial-place of the Macgregors, 
and is still used for the same purpose by the people 
of the parish of Buchanan. It is inhabited, and pro¬ 
duces some grain, but is in general elevated and very 
woody. 

On the south of it is Inch Clear, of small size, and 
entirely overgrown with trees. Inch Aber, of less 
extent, is immediately opposite to the mouth of the 
Endrick, from which circumstance it seems to have 
obtained its name. Inch Fad lies on the north of 
Inch Caillaich. It is narrow, and only half a mile in 
length; inhabited, however, and producing excellent 
pasture and grain. Inch Moan is a mossy isle, on 
the west of the former, being three quarters of a 
mile long, and one broad. It contains more than a 
hundred acres, from which the village of Luss is 
supplied with peats. On the north of Rossdoe is 
Inch Galbraith, a small circular isle, on which are 
the ruins of a castle, once belonging to a family of

the same name. It is covered with wood, and is a 
resort of the osprey or sea eagle, and other birds of 
prey. Inch Tavanach is an island of larger dimen¬ 
sions, and is situated to the north of the last. It is 
of considerable elevation, commanding a view of the 
whole lake, is three quarters of a mile long, half a 
mile broad, and contains 150 acres, chiefly covered 
with woods and heath of an exuberant growth. It 
is a retreat of the roebuck, and of a steep ascent, 
which, however, has been facilitated by a winding 
road made by Sir James Colquhoun, to whom it 
belongs. North-east from this is Inch Conagan, a 
small isle, abounding with oak and fir; and more to 
the eastward is Inch Cruin, a woodless spot, of nearly 
the same extent, which is sometimes used as an asy¬ 
lum for the insane. Surrounded by a cluster of lesser 
isles, is Inch Lonay, farther to the north, and con¬ 
taining above 150 acres, one half of which is covered 
with a natural wood of very large old yews. It is 
stocked with deer, and is the property of Sir James 
Colquhoun. Cardach, Buck Inch, Ross, and other 
inconsiderable isles, in the same direction, rear their 
green heads above the water, but are not remarkable 
for their size or value. 

The depth * of Loch-Lomond is very various. 


* Loch-Lomond at the deepest shows the thermometer on the surface 
standing at 63'*, at the bottom 41'): Loch-Tay is 70 fathoms deep near its 
middle; its temperature is 62" on the surface, 410 and two-tenths at the 
bottom: Loch-Ketturrin is 78 one-third fathoms in depth, opposite the farm 
of Letter; its temperature is 630 on the surface, and 41" at the bottom. 
The greatest depth of Loch-Ness is 129 fathoms, but its temperature has 
not been ascertained. 

2 C 






302 Gradual rise of the waters of Loch-Loniond. 

South from Luss it seldom exceeds 20 fathoms, op¬ 
posite the point of Firkin it is 66, near Tarbet 86, 
and about two miles north from that place it is 100, 
which is probably its greatest depth. Its banks and 
islands are abundant in fine natural woods, chiefly of 
oak, ash, birch, holly, mountain-ash or rowan, hazel, 
alder, aspen, yew, hawthorn, and willows. The 
other indigenous plants are nearly the same as in 
other alpine regions, where soil and climate are si¬ 
milar. Among the rare plants produced in this part 
of the country, are the quillwort, awlwort, lesser 
water plantain, flowering fern, crowned lichen, and 
several others. The lake abounds with delicious 
trout, and the southern part of it is frequented by 
salmons, in their passage across it towards the river 
Endrick, in the waters of which this species of fish 
takes particular delight. 

By the deposition of sand and mud at the efflux 
of the river Leven, the lake has been gradually in¬ 
creasing in size during many years. In Camstradden 
Bay the ruins of houses are observed in the water a 
considerable space from the shore, and a once inha¬ 
bited islet between that and Inch Tavanach has now 
altogether disappeared. This seems to have been 
the one described by Cambden, as having a house 
and orchard in his days. At the north end of the 
lake, also, stones were placed at regular distances, 
for the purposes of enabling passengers to cross the 
channel of the river Falloch, but they are now co¬ 
vered by upwards of five feet of water. 

From these short observations, it will be found.

that Loch-Lomond and its environs possess almost 
every requisite to exalt the imagination, to engage 
the attention, to sweeten peace, and to furnish amuse¬ 
ment to solitude. 

“ O Solitude, romantic maid. 

Whether by nodding towers you tread; 

Or haunt the desert’s trackless gloom. 

Or hover o’er the yawning tomb; 

Or climb the Andes’ clefted side. 

Or by the Nile’s coy source abide; 

Or, starting from your half-year’s sleep, 

From Heela view the thawing deep; 

Or, at the purple dawn of day, 

Tadmor’s marble wastes survey ; 

You, recluse, again 1 woo. 

And again your steps pursue.” 

Smollett. 

Having surveyed the beauties of the lake, the 
traveller will doubtless pursue his journey to the 
summit of azure-mantled Ben. For this purpose 
he will be provided with a boat at Luss, to con¬ 
vey him to Rowardennan, a hamlet at the foot of 
the mountain, in which there is a convenient inn. 
As the morning is the fittest time for ascending the 
hill, it will be proper to lodge here during the night, 
and make preparations for the next day’s journey, 
which ought to begin at an early hour. If* however, 
his curiosity prompt, and his leisure permit him, he 
may find a few hours amusement in making an ex¬ 
cursion to Rob Roy’s Cave. This is situated in 
Craigrostan, on the edge of the lake, at the foot of 
Ben-Lomond, a few miles above Rowardennan. In 
the same lone region, he may also contemplate the 
temporary retreat of a magnanimous king. Robert 
the Bruce, with a few generous adherents, passed the

night, after his defeat at Dairy in Strath-Fillan, in 
one of the caves of Craigrostan. 

Having procured a guide, which is absolutely 
necessary, and provisions to serve by the way, the 
Wanderer will, with the rising sun, proceed to climb 
the side of the mountain, which rises with a steep 
ascent for six miles, when a slow, steady, persevering 
pace will, in less than three hours, bring him through 
clouds and the flitting rack of heaven, to its exalted 
summit. From this, if the day is clear, the view is 
indescribably interesting and grand. At the bottom 
is seen the lake, finely variegated by its isles, which, 
having lost their rugged forms, appear as plains amid 
the bright expanse, while its banks are beautified by 
wooded villas and well cultivated lands. Looking 
towards the east, the rich champaigns of Stirling¬ 
shire and Lothian are distinctly spread out to the 
sight; and, by the western view, the high grounds 
of Lanarkshire, the fine vales of Renfrewshire, with 
the Frith of Clyde, and the wide Atlantic, are dis¬ 
cerned from afar. At the same time Ireland and 
the Isle of Man sink in the distance, and blend, as 
it were, with the azure sky. The northern pros¬ 
pect is grotesque and grand, presenting objects, fan¬ 
tastic in their conformation, and terribly sublime in 
the vastness of their forms. The eye, passing from 
the Ochels to the western ocean, sees nothing but 
mountain towering above mountain in every diver¬ 
sity of shape. In this enormous range are observed, 
Ben-Nevis, 4-370 feet above the level of the sea, the 
highest of all the British hills; Ben-Lawers, Ben-

the south-west, Goatfield in Arran, and the lofty 
Paps of Jura lost in distance. To the north-east 
may be seen Loch-Ketturrin, Loch-Ard, and other 
lakes of Perthshire, appearing like embossed mirrors 
amid the valleys of the mountains. 

The north side of Ben-Lomond is very steep, 
forming a terrific precipice more than three hundred 
fathoms deep. From this side springs the famous 
Forth, here an inconsiderable rill, where

Ben-Lomond cleaves the clouds asunder. 

Majestic spurns the lightning’s gleam.

It is soon, however, swelled by the mountain 
torrents into a small brook, which, expanding into 
various little lakes, winds away through the valleys, 
in beautiful mimicry of its meanderings in the Carse 
of Stirling. 

Xhe perpendicular height of Ben-Lomond is 3240 
feet above the surface of the lake, and 3262 above 
the level of the sea. It is elegantly insulated from 
the adjacent hills, and its form being that of a vast 
truncated cone, its appearance, from whatever side 
it is viewed, is much more noble and magnificent 
than any other of the Caledonian mountains. The 
top is bare, and bleached by the warring winds, 
whence its descriptive appellation. The Hill of the 
Naked Height; but its lower parts, on the side next 
the lake, are finely skirted with wood.

the mountain, the Tourist may cross to Inveruglas, 
pass the Point of Firkin, and by a gentle serpentine 
declivity, shaded with lofty oaks, pursue his journey 
to Tarbet, an inn a few miles farther up the lake. 
From this place also there is a conveyance across 
Loch-Lomond, and is frequently the route of those 
who design to make the alpine excursion last de¬ 
scribed. At the inn, he will, doubtless, be shown 
the Pane of the Poetical Inscription, the work of an 
English gentleman who had returned from a visit to 
the King of Hills. Although like other Directories 
it is in every body’s hands, its merits as a poem, and 
its usefulness as a guide, may render it acceptable to 
the traveller of taste. It is, therefore, subjoined. 

Stranger, if o’er this pane of glass perchance 
Thy roving eye should cast a casual glance: 

If taste for grandeur, and the dread sublime. 

Prompt thee Ben-Lomond’s fearful height to climb: 

Here gaze attentive, nor with scorn refuse. 

The friendly rhyming of a tavern muse. 

For thee that muse this rude inscription plann’d, 
prompted for thee her humble poet’s hand. 

Heed thou the poet; he thy steps shall lead. 

Safe o’er yon tow’ring hill’s aspiring head; 

Attentive then to this informing lay. 

Read how he dictates, as he points the way. 

Trust not at first a quick advent’rous pace. 

Six miles its top points gradual from the base. 

Up the high rise with panting haste I pass’d. 

And gain’d the long laborious steep at last. 

More prudent thou, when once you pass the deep. 

With measur’d pace, and sloiv, ascend the steep. 

Oft stay thy steps, oft taste the cordial drop. 

And rest, oh rest, long, long, upon the top. 

There hail the breezes, nor with toilsome haste, 

Down the rough slope thy precious vigour waste: 

So shall thy wond’ring sight at once survey, 

Vales, lakes, woods, mountains, islands, rocks, and sea, 

Huge hills, that heap’d in crowded order stand. 

Stretch’d o’er the northern and the western land;

Thomas Russel, Oct. 3d, 1771. 

The inn of Tarbet is a neat modern house, fitted up 
for the accommodation of strangers, and situated on 
the right hand side of the road. If the plan of his 
tour has not been already laid down, the Traveller 
will have to choose whether he will visit the Trosachs 
and return by Callender and Stirling, or doubling 
the northern extremity of Loch-Long, proceed to 
Inveraray. As either may, therefore, be selected, it 
will be the object of this sketch to delineate both. 
But, that the Journeyer towards the wes-t may be 
detained in comfortable quarters, while his compan¬ 
ion, perhaps, is conducted on his eastward route, it 
will be proper to lead him to Arroquhar, near the 
extremity of the last mentioned lake. 

Leaving Tarbet, then, and turning to the left at the 
inn, the road is carried through a ravine between the 
mountains, and is shaded on each side by lofty trees. 
Its loneness, however, is diversified by straggling 
cottages, and, at the end of two miles, is enlivened 
by a fine view of Loch-Long, spreading its waters 
into an ample expanse, and bathing with its waves 
the rugged bases of the ambient hills. A short way 
before reaching its margin, the road turns to the left. 




308 Glengyle—Locli-Ketturrin. 

and leads to the inn of Arroquhar, at the distance of 
twenty-two miles from Dunbarton, or thirty-seven 
from Glasgow, and where the Tourist may be left, 
for the present, in the possession of every enjoyment 
a romantic country, a spacious lodging, and an hos¬ 
pitable landlord, can bestow. 

Returning to Tarbet. A road is continued from 
this to Tyndrum, at the northern boundary of Loch- 
Lomond, where it doubles to the right, and, descend¬ 
ing through Glengyle, conducts to the Perthshire 
lakes. About two miles, however, from the inn there 
is a ferry, where the traveller may cross the lake, and 
passing the Fort of Inversnaid, by a difficult road of 
six miles in length, will approach Loch-Ketturrin, 
near its western extremity. Having left the small 
lake of Loch-Archlat on the right, and made a short 
turn towards the left, near the hamlet of Stronclach- 
aig, he will gain a view of the object of his wishes 
—a picture, unrivalled, will arrest his attention, and 
fill his mind with admiration. 

Loch-Ketturrin, the Loch-Ceid-Iurrin of the na¬ 
tives, signifying The Lake of the Rocky Region of 
Cold and Gloom , is a beautiful expanse of water si¬ 
tuated in Strath-Gartney, measuring ten and a half 
miles in length, and one and a half in breadth. It 
is formed by the river Teith, and its streamlets de¬ 
scending from the adjacent hills by which it is sur¬ 
rounded. Its form is that of a natant eel, with the 
head towards the west. On all sides it is confined 
by elevated cliffy mountains, and its banks are beau¬ 
tifully skirted with thickets of close growing natural 






Different aspects under which Loch-Ketturrin may be viewed. 309 

woods. On the south are Calagart, Glasschoit, and 
other sequestered hamlets, intercepted from the view 
by the thick foliage of the trees. The dreary pre¬ 
cipices of Glengyle bound it on the west, and, on 
the north, upon the skirts of the swelling hills, are 
Port-nan-ellan, Coilicrach, Ardmacmuin, Strongar- 
valtry, Edralecach, Letter, Breanchoil, and other 
lonely retreats. From its eastern extremity flows 
the Teith, a beautiful and majestic stream. 

On joining its margin, the traveller may, perhaps, 
choose to sail down the lake, in which case, the 
scenery will appear to much advantage, and may be 
charmingly varied by assuming different positions 
during his progress towards the opposite shore. But, 
that a choice may be left to the Tourist, this sketch 
will conduct him to the northern bank, along which 
the road winds, and describe the various stations 
which command interesting views. At Port-nan- 
ellan, the scenery of the lake exhibits the most pic¬ 
turesque flow of harmonizing lines, bold masses, and 
varied hues. When the woods put on the yellow 
tints of autumn, and the bosom of the watery expanse 
is clear, reflective, and finely illumined in gradations 
of aerian softness, the effect of the setting sun is fan¬ 
tastic and charming. When he sinks behind the 
mountains, the darkling hue gradually deepens into 
the dusky shades of evening, and, when night in so¬ 
lemn silence closes around, and the thin blue vapour 
spreads on the distant verge of the water, floating 
along the bosom of the bending steep, when the 
moon rises in graceful movement from behind the

hills, tipping the top-cliffs with the mildest lustre, 
pouring in a lengthened stream of faint yellow rays 
along the surface of the quivering lake, a crowd of 
soft and delightful emotions seizes upon those minds 
which are formed to relish such transcendent scenes, 
and excite feelings of the highest gratification, pro¬ 
duced by an assemblage of that picturesque beauty 
which is combined in a landscape diversified by 
mountain, vale, wood, and water. 

Here Benvenu, Ben-Bheinn-Uch, the Hill among 
Lofty Hills, forms the chief feature in the back ground. 
In the centre, the craggy wilds of Coilichrah, termi¬ 
nating in a promontory pushing its rugged front into 
the lake, are prominent in the landscape. The inter¬ 
vening objects are beautiful indentations and swelling 
capes, above which bushy woods and hanging rocks 
boldly project, in variegated hues, and a rich diversity 
of luxuriant herbage. The opposite side of the lake 
forms, to this, a striking contrast. It is brown and 
barren, and enlivened with ne’er a spot of green, save 
where some lonely spring, oozing through the russet 
heath, spreads a fresh verdure along the banks of its 
rippling course. Lceta susurrantes fugiunt per gra - 
mina rivi. 

The hills upon the left rise bare, bleak, and cheer¬ 
less. In the foreground some islands, together with 
a solitary hut, the former residence of Rob Roy, *

to the Hebrides, vol. I. p. 204; and in Campbell’s Journey through North 
Britain, vol. I. p. 123. The story of Rob’s adventures have lately been 
made the groundwork of the interesting novel which bears his name.

the famous freebooter, come into the prospect with 
singular effect. 

A knoll, somewhat to the right of this station, 
forms an advantageous position whence to view the 
effect of scenery on this part of the lake. On turning 
round, and looking up Glengyle, a lone house amid 
a desert, wild and rude, excites a chilling sensation 
when the idea arises of spending a winter in so drear 
a region. 

On approaching the eastern shores of the lake, 
the entrance into it presents a wild magnificence, 
peculiar to the spot. On the left, the hoary cliffs, 
hung with weeping birch and a variety of brushwood 
matted and thickly interwoven, are seen shelving in 
airy grandeur. Above the rest, and directly opposite 
to Benvenu, the bare pinnacle of Binean raises its 
t( fantastic forms unseen, save by the poet’s eye.” 

“ High on the top-cliffs of yon conic steep 
Scotland’s dread genius stood, and gazed afar 
On Rome’s proud legions. Hark ! the sounding shield 
Twangs on his arm, while echo pours along. 

And rouses Albion’s chieftains.—Quick through wood, 

O’er wild, from winding valley, mountain, plain. 

Come pouring forth, fierce and indignant, those 
To conquer, to repel the foe, resolved 
Gloriously to fall, fighting for freedom. 

Freedom’s injured cause.”— 

A. Campbell. 

As he winds along the shore, it interchangeably 
displays to the wondering traveller, in finely flowing 
sweeps, its woody shores, and a mountainous dis¬ 
tance, forming a back-ground at once elegant and 
lofty. The nearer prospect exhibits a bold mass of 
almost vertical rock, whose creviced sides are covered 








512 Remarkable features of the lake. 

with pendent trees, of picturesque appearance, and 
consisting chiefly of weeping-birch, rowan, oak, and 
other indigenous forest-trees, whose roots are bare and 
twisted into many a curious shape. The mountains 
on the left present a sublime air, and the more remote 
assume the finest aerian tints. Here, the distance is 
enlivened by the scattered huts of the inhabitants 
of these romantic wilds: there, is a bold head-land, 
where the black rocks dip into unfathomable water. 
The road is sometimes cut through the solid rock, 
which rises to 200 feet of perpendicular height. In 
other places, it winds along the base of rugged and 
stupendous cliffs, in each of which dwells a young 
echo, whose notes are responsive to the harmonious 
melody of birds, or the sweet songs of women and 
children gathering filberts beneath the autumnal sky. 
On the trees and upon the crags are perched the 
wild-birds, and the sea-fowls frequent their reedy 
retreats or skim on the surface of the waters, while 
the goats of the hills scramble amid the rocks in 
search of their scanty food. Here, indeed, is an 
ever-varying scene, where dells, and capes, and bays, 
and thickets, successively intercept each other from 
the view, and produce an effect perpetually changing 
as the continual appearance of new objects rises or 
retires from the sight. 

Having gained the eastern extremity of the lake, 
the traveller will naturally pause, turn round, and 
review the romantic scenery which he has now 
passed, and amid which 




The Trosachs.

“ Boon nature scatter’d, free and wild. 

Each plant or flower, the mountain’s child. 

Here eglantine embalmed the air. 

Hawthorn and hazel mingled there; 

The primrose pale, and violet flower. 

Found in each cleft a narrow bower; 

Fox-glove and night-shade, side by side. 

Emblems of punishment and pride; 

Grouped their dark hues with every stain. 

The weather-beaten crags retain; 

With boughs that quaked at every breath. 

Gray birch and aspen wept beneath; 

Aloft, the ash and warrior oak 
Cast anchor in the rifted rock; 

And higher yet, the pine-tree hung 
His shatter’d trunk, and frequent flung. 

Where seem’d the cliffs to meet on high. 

His boughs athwart the narrowed sky. 

Highest of all, where white peaks glanced. 

Where glistening streamers wav’d and danced. 

The wanderer’s eye could barely view 
The summer heaven’s delicious blue; 

So wondrous wild the whole might seem 
The scenery of a fairy dream.” 

Scott's lady of the Lake. 


Situated on the margin of that deep dark pool in 
which the lake terminates, let the stranger stand and 
contemplate the view before him. On the left swells 
a gigantic precipice, wooded to the summit, and 
frowning from on high in sullen grandeur. Among 
these rocks, whose gloom rests eternal upon the 
bosom of Loch-Ketturrin, in former times, existed a 
savage band, rude, ruthless, intractable and cruel, 
who issued forth and committed incessant depreda¬ 
tions on the peaceful inhabitants of these sequestered 
glens. Hence the shaggy precipice retains the chill¬ 
ing appellation of Coirre-nan-Uriskin, The Recess of 
the Ferocious Otics.—Hic specus horrendum, et scevi 
spiracula Ditis.

The Trosachs.—Loch-Achray. 


Nearly opposite to this headlong steep, wicker huts 
have been judiciously placed upon a rock which rises 
perpendicularly from the water. Here the traveller 
may rest and contemplate Nature in her wildest and 
sublimest aspects. 

The tourist will turn his back, with regret, upon 
this enchanting, though terrific, fairy-land of the 
North, and proceed on his winding way, which will 
conduct him, wondering as he goes, along the dell 
of the Trosachs, The Place of Protuberant Wilds . 
This, however, is only a modern name, its primitive 
appellation being Breanchoil, The Spot of the Woody 
Hills. The scenery here is exceedingly wild and 
romantic. Rugged rocks of every form and size 
surround, and in many places, overhang the road. 
These are all overgrown with luxuriant heath, and 
adorned to their summits with weeping birch. What¬ 
ever, indeed, is beautiful, or fantastic, or wild, or 
picturesque, or sublime, or terrible, are associated in 
this celebrated region. 

Winding along the base of the silvan hills, the 
journeyer, having the river Teith on his right, gra¬ 
dually approaches Loch-Achray. It is, perhaps, one 
of the sweetest little lakes in Scotland, bounded on 
the north by an uninterrupted wood, which is finely 
contrasted with its bare and heathy southern bank. 
The general aspect of this pretty piece of water is 
truly charming. It seems to rest calm, serene, and 
smooth, amid the surrounding hills. Cultivated spots, 
among which hamlets are seen thickly scattered be¬ 
neath the shelter of green knolls and wooded steeps,

convey the idea of quiet and contentment, the bless¬ 
ings of honest industry and frugal retirement. The 
^^Jjitants here, though poor, are ignorant of the 
wants known only to such who depend upon the 
labours of others, and on whom they affect to look 
down with disdain. 

Having passed the eastern extremity of this pic¬ 
turesque lake, the road is conducted, by a cognomi- 
nal bridge, across the Water of Turk. This rivulet 
descends the vale of Glenfinglass, the scenery of 
which is singularly wild, yet far from exciting the 
idea of that rude and barren nakedness which gene¬ 
rally pervades the glens of the northern mountains. 
The Turk, having flowed through it in tranquil 
meanderings, suddenly sinks into a profound chasm, 
formed by some terrible convulsion of nature, and 
there it is heard far below, brawling along the secret 
fragments of rock, in its rapid course. Soon after, 
crossing the road, it falls into the waters of the 
winding Teith. 

Following the now majestic river, another lake of 
more ample size, and more romantic accompaniments, 
soon opens on the bewildered view. This is Loch- 
Venu-Char, The Lake of the Steeps of Benvenu , which 
is five miles in length, and, in general, a mile and a 
half in breadth. On the right, its margin swells 
gently into retiring eminences; and, upon the left, 
a bold promontory finely formed and beautifully 
wooded, advances into the middle of the water, and 
rises into a precipice rugged, steep, and craggy. 
Before leaving, perhaps for ever, the last of these

interesting Caledonian Lakes, the traveller may stop 
at the east end of that last described, and in a re¬ 
verted view survey the wonders and the beauties 
which he has just left behind him. The eye, here, 
will have before it a most magnificent landscape, 
consisting of Benvenu, Binean, and the ample out¬ 
line of the Trosachs, a spacious tract of country, 
grandly diversified by stream, and vale, and wood, 
and rock, and lake, and lofty mountains, and such 
as will amply repay to those who have a relish for 
Nature retired amid her deepest solitudes, the toil 
and the danger attending this exploratory route. 

“ The western waves of ebbing day 
Waved o’er the glen their level way; 

Each purple peak, each flinty spire. 

Was bathed in floods of living tire. 

But not a setting beam could glow. 

Within the dark ravine below. 

Where twined the path, in shadow hid. 

Round many a rooky pyramid. 

Shooting abruptly from the dell 
Its thunder-splintered pinnacle; 

Round many an insulated mass. 

The native bulwarks of the pass. 

Huge as the tower which builders vain 
Presumptuous piled on Shinar’s plain. 

The rocky summits, split and rent. 

Formed turret, dome, or battlement. 

Or seemed fantastically set 
With copula, or minaret, 

Wild crests as pagod ever decked. 

Or mosque of eastern architect. 

Nor were these earth-born castles bare. 

Nor lacked they many a banner fair; 

For, from their shivered brows displayed. 

Far o’er the unfathomable glade, 

All twinkling with the dew drop sheen. 

The briar rose fell in streamers green. 

And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes. 

Waved in the west wind’s summer sighs.” 

Scott’s Lady of the Lata. 







Callender.—Bo-castle.—Ben-Ledi. 317 

At about a mile and a half from the west end of 
Loch-Venuchar, the road passes Milton, where there 
is a small cascade facing the south, and upon the 
spray of which the reflected beams of the noonday 
sun produce a lively iridescence playing, with a fit¬ 
ful buoyancy, on the breath of the summer breeze. 
After crossing the northern branch of the Teith, the 
tourist will arrive at Callender, near which the river 
is greatly enlarged by the confluence of its two 
streams. In the vicinity of this village is a beauti¬ 
ful serpentine bank denominated, for whatever rea¬ 
son, The Homan Camp, a view of which, and a still 
grander one on the return, will repay the short walk 
necessary to visit it. Near this also stands Bo-castle, 
belonging to the Earl of Braidalbane, and once the 
residence of the Balfours of Burleigh, on the north 
bank of Loch-Leven in Kinross-shire. On the plain, 
the remains of an artificial bank has given rise to the 
conjecture, that it had been raised as a line of ap¬ 
proach for reducing the place. In the vast angle 
formed by the Teith’s two branches, stands the proud 
Ben-Ledi, majestic, huge, and high. From its name 
Ben-Lech-Dhi, The Mountain of the Stone of the 
Divinity , it is supposed to have been an High-place 
of the Druids, whereon these primeval priests adored 
the Eternal with the purest and most sublime devo¬ 
tion, accompanied by the simplest of rites. 

The northern branch of the Teith, or Balvaig, 
rises, not far distant from the source of the other, 
at the bottom of a mountain named Stobh-doine, and 
proceeding in a north-eastern direction, receives in-

numerous rivulets from the hills, as it flows. A road 
winds along its banks and leads through Inverchar- 
naig, Manachalmore upon Loch-Doine, and Craigrie 
on Loch-Voil, to Balquhidder, at the east end of this 
lake, a little beyond which it falls into that from 
Perth by Crieff, Comrie, Portmore, and Loch-Earn- 
head. Near Balquhidder, the stream assumes a 
south-eastern course, and flowing through Strath-Ire, 
falls into Loch-Lubnaig, a fine sheet of water, over¬ 
looked by Ben-Ledi, and surrounded by every species 
of alpine scenery, whether the pleasing, the astonish¬ 
ing, or the terrific. Out of this the river dashes, in 
a series of falls, to join its sister-stream, through a 
declivity of above two hundred feet, and having a 
beautiful skirting of wood which feasts the eye, while 
the ear is pleased with the sonorous vibrations of the 
cataract’s roar. 

Should the Traveller, instead of descending the 
Forth to Stirling, have arranged a plan of penetra¬ 
ting through the mountains, by a northern route, it 
shall now be the business of his faithful “ Guide ” to 
conduct his wanderings with safety and advantage. 
Let him, then, leave Callender for Comrie, a stage 
of fourteen miles, at an early hour, and ascending the 
North Teith he will soon leave Kilmahog and arrive 
at the Pass of Leney, the entrance to which strikes 
every beholder with the magnificent appearance of a 
vast silvan amphitheatre, rising in solemn grandeur 
before him. Having traversed this romantic wood¬ 
land, he will reach St. Bryde’s Chapel, and a little 
beyond it discover the waters of Loch-Lubnaig, with 




Loch-Earn-head.—Corarie. 319 

its charming scenery, expanding on the view. Still 
advancing between the forest and the lake, he will 
perceive, on his right, Ardchullery, the favourite 
residence of Mr. Bruce, the celebrated Abyssinian 
traveller. Near this is the tremendous rock, Craig- 
na-coheilg, the ancient gathering-place of the conti¬ 
guous clans. At Invervoulin he will enter Strath- 
Ire, and leave the beautiful lake-scenery for that of 
a mountain-vale. Passing in succession the hamlets 
of Inveroich, Craigans, and Ruskachan, he will come 
to King’s-house, whence a road conducts to Bal- 
quhidder and the banks of Loch-Voil. From King’s- 
house, a winding route will bring him to Loch-Earn- 
head, on the west end of the lake which lends it a 
name. This lake is 8 miles long, and 1^ in breadth: 
its banks on either side are covered with a profusion 
of natural oak wood, and the lofty Ben-Vorlich, seen 
from afar, overlooks its head. 

Proceeding along the north margin of Loch-Earn, 
the road passes Ardveck, and penetrating the fine 
woodlands, stretches onward to Portmore, Morad, 
and Movy, near which, on the north, is Dunira, the 
delightful hunting-seat of Lord Melville. From this, 
a short but wildly diversified route will lead the 
Tourist to the picturesque village of Comrie, famous 
for its earthquakes, and situated at the confluence of 
the Earn and Ruchil waters. On the opposite side of 
the Earn, at Dalginross, are the remains of a Roman 
camp, from which the distance, along the Glenlichorn 
road, to the more perfect camp at Ardoch, is about 
12 miles. Near the east end of the town is Comrie- 





320 Obelisk erected to Lord Melville.—Crieff. 


castle, a fine old structure, belonging to Lord Mel¬ 
ville; and behind it, on an eminence, is the obelisk 
of granite, 72 feet high, erected in 1812 to comme¬ 
morate the patriotic virtues of Henry, Lord Viscount 
Melville, who died 27th May 1811. In the policies 
is a serpentine walk, sheltered by umbrageous trees, 
and terminating at a romantic waterfall and pool, on 
the river Lednoch, named the Devil’s Basin, which 
the curious always take occasion to visit. Leaving 
Comrie, and sweeping along the base of the moun¬ 
tains, the road passes, on the left, Lawers, the seat 
of Col. Robertson, and Clathic, the property of Lord 
President Colquhoun, and beyond this Auchtertyre, 
the beautiful residence of Sir Patrick Murray, near 
which are the falls of the Turret, with the glen and 
loch of the same name. Soon after, it enters the 
prosperous town of Crieff, with a population of 3500 
inhabitants, situated on the base of the Grampians, 
and commanding a wide view of the adjacent coun¬ 
try. 

From Crieff a stage of 17-} miles will bring the 
traveller to Perth. Having left his resting-place, 
his attention will forthwith be directed to Fernton, 
the seat of General Sir David Baird, rising on the 
side of a finely wooded hill, the Cnoc of Crieff, on

rossa, soon after comes into view, on the right, then 
Tippermalloch belonging to Mr. Moncrieff, and a 
little farther on, the village of Methven. * Passing 
on the left, Methven-castle the abode of Col. Smith, 
and Hunting-tower, the property of Mr. Keir of 
Milnearn, in which James VI. was kept a short 
time in confinement, in 1582, by the father of the 
Earl of Gowrie whom that king’s attendants af¬ 
terwards killed at Perth, the road leaves Flews- 
house on the same side, and having traversed a 
pleasantly diversified country enters Perth, afford¬ 
ing a front view of the bridge, the North Insh, with 
Scoone-palace, and the woody banks of the Tay. 

Strath-Earn, however, in not unworthy of a tran¬ 
sient survey: it possesses objects which may reward 
the labour of a more circuitous route from Crieff to 
the city of St. John. The river Earn, whose waters 
fertilize and adorn it, originates from its parent lake, 
the sources of which issue in numberless streams 
from the sides of the ambient mountains. Its course 
is in a south-east direction, through a country beau¬ 
tified with every diversity of scenery-—mountains, 
hills, rocks, woodlands, and waters. Flowing past 
Comrie and Crieff it permeates the Strath, in many 
picturesque windings, and joins the Tay a little be- 


* Lynedoch-cottage, the charming residence of Lord Lynedoch, stands in 
this parish, beautifully situated on the banks of the Almond-water. A short 
ride conducts to it from Perth, and it is a fashionable object of visit during 
the fine months of summer. This sweet spot exhibits a happy display of 
the beauties of Nature improved by the graces of Art. Near it is the grave 
of « Bessy Bell and Mary Gray,’ whose loveliness and premature destiny 
are pathetically commemorated in a well-known Scottish song.

low the venerable ruins of Elcho-castle. It is passed 
by means of five principal bridges ; those of Crieff, 
Kinkell, Dalreoch, Forteviot, and Bridge of Earn, 
as high as which it is navigable by small vessels. 
Its banks throughout are decorated by the mansions 
of many rich and ancient families, imbosomed in 
their coppices and umbrageous woods. 

Having spent a short time in Crieff, and taken an 
opportunity of examining the different objects of 
curiosity in its neighbourhood, the Stranger will 
depart from that place on his tour through Strath- 
Earn. From the toll-bar at the east end of the 
town, he will take the road on his right; and, pro¬ 
ceeding along the base of the hill, with Fernton on 
his left, will soon obtain a view of Inshbraco, the 
seat of Col. Graeme, among the enclosures and trees, 
on the north. Beyond it, eastward, Abercairney is 
seen rising among its extensive woods. Turning to 
the south, he will pass a bridge, and perceive Dol» 
larie, the residence of Mr. Murray, on his right. 
Not far in advance, he will again turn to the right, 
at the cross roads, and traverse the Moor of Mad- 
derty, from which is a fine prospect of the western 
part of the strath. The most prominent objects of 
his survey will be the once famous Abbey of Insh- 
effray, * on the east bank of the Earn, the houses of 


* Insheffray-abbey is situated on an eminence where the Pow-water falls 
into the Earn. It was founded A. D. 1200, by Gilbert Earl of Strath-Earn 
and Matilda his countess, who dedicated it to the honour of God, the Bles¬ 
sed Virgin, and John the apostle and evangelist. Its remains, with seven 
acres of land in the vicinity, have gone into the possession of the Earl of 
Kinnoul, who in consequence is patron of twelve parishes originally attached 





Gentlemen’s seats in Strath-Earn. 323 

Kildees and Drumaquhance, where is a remarkable 
waterfall, the property of General Drummond, and 
the village of Muthil on the opposite side, with 
Drummond-castle, belonging to the Honourable 
Mr. Drummond Burrell, who married the heiress 
of Perth. The woody hill of Torlum, at whose 
base stands this princely seat, commands a complete 
view of Strath-Earn, in its whole extent of more 
than thirty miles. 

Advancing in the same course, the Traveller will 
soon approach the intersection made by the spacious 
old Roman road which connected the stations of 
Ardoch and Perth. Beyond this, by a winding de¬ 
scent, he will come to the plantations and house of 
Milnearn, the residence of Mr. Keir, and below it 
cross the river by the bridge of Kinkell. At a short 
distance forward he will pass the Water of Mahony, 
and, inclining to the west, leave Strathallan-house 
the seat of James Drummond, Esq. of Mahony, 
M. P. for the county, on his right. On the same 
side, in advance, and belonging to the same pro¬ 
prietor, he will observe the castle of Tullibardine 
with its dilapidated chapel, founded in 1445 by Sir 
David Murray, ancestor of the Dukes of Athol. 
The road now enters the Moor, beyond which it

■which was fought between Edward II. and Robert Bruce, in 1314, and 
said mass in front of the Scottish lines before the action commenced. To 
inspirit the pious courage of his countrymen, he carried along with him the 
arm of St. Fillan, whose intercession doubtless contributed much to their vic¬ 
tory. At Insheffray is a library of good books, chiefly theological, to which 
clergymen and students of divinity have free access.

intersects that from Stirling to Perth, and stretches 
southward through the dell of Gleneagles and Glen- 
devon, to the Yetts of Muckhart. Here it crosses 
the road from Kinross to Stirling, and reaching the 
Devon, passes it at the Rumbling Bridge, and pro¬ 
ceeds to Dunfermline and Queensferry. At the in¬ 
tersection, the Tourist will turn to his left, and de¬ 
scend to the long irregular town of Auchterarder, 
having a view, on the right, of the ruins of Kincar¬ 
dine-castle, an ancient strong-hold of the Grahams 
of Montrose, and near it the stately mansion of the 
same name, built by the late Mr. Johnston, whose 
family still possesses it and the adjacent domains. 

Two roads lead from Auchterarder to Perth. The 
most direct one proceeds through the village, and 
passing Dam side-house on the right, enters Abruth- 
ven, containing the tomb and cemetery of the noble 
family of Montrose, and the remains of an old chapel. 
Crossing the Ruthven-water by a narrow bridge, and 
ascending through Smithyhaugh, it gives off a branch 
to Dunning on the right, and stretches onwards to 
the Broom of Dalreoch, affording a view of the ru¬ 
inous tower of Gask-hall on the north bank of the 
Earn. Here, tradition affirms, the intrepid Wallace 
stood “ gretlye agast” when the ghost of Fawdoun 
stood before him with “ hys awne hede in hys hand.” 
Situated on the summit of the same bank, and inar- 
boured by fine trees, is the House of Gask, belong¬ 
ing to Mr. Oliphant, behind which is the Roman 
road to Perth, and the distinct traces of a station 
understood to have been constructed by the soldiers

of Agricola. North-east from the Broom is the 
Bridge of Dalreoch over the Earn, beyond which a 
ride of two miles affords the traveller a most inter¬ 
esting survey of the beauties of the Strath, outspread 
in pleasing diversity between him and the hills. 
Having reached Duplin-parks and crossed the Ro¬ 
man road, his attention will be engaged with the 
landscape lying between him and the Grampians. 
Amid this ample scene, Methven-castle and Logie- 
house on the north bank of the Almond, rise with 
agreeable effect on the wandering eye. While ex¬ 
amining this picture, his approach to Perth will be 
enlivened by observation of a number of villas and 
country-seats of her merchants, till the town be en¬ 
tered by a magnificent street, and the Tourist resign 
himself to rest, and reflection, and Athol Brose. 

Should choice, however, induce the Stranger to 
proceed to Perth by Dunning, he will bend to his 
right near the east end of Auchterarder; and, while 
descending to the hamlet of Milton, may enjoy a 
fine view of the Ochels, having Foswell-bank built 
by the late Col. Henderson on their northern aspect. 
Crossing the Ruthven-water, he will soon make se¬ 
veral turnings, and, on his right, leave the farm¬ 
house of Coul. Beyond this, the road passes the 
Pairney-bourn, flowing through a rocky chasm, 
where it forms numerous falls and pools, and is in 
many places obscured by the dense foliage of alpine 
trees. On the right is Craig-Rossie, an elevated 
peak of the Ochels, commanding a great variety and 
extent of prospect. At its base is the remarkable

green mound of Tirnavie, possessing much resem¬ 
blance to the subverted hull of a ship. Farther 
east, in the range, is Rossie-law, with its circular 
enclosure, described in legendary story as the site 
of a primeval camp. Pleasantly situated at the base 
of a silvan mount, on the same hand, in advance, is 
the ancient house of Kelty, belonging to Captain 
Drummond; and more eastward Kippen-green, a 
neat cottage belonging to Mr. Graeme of Garvock, 
almost hid by its surrounding trees. Placed on a 
higher site, and beyond this, is Pitcairn, the resi¬ 
dence of Mr. Pitcairn, the view from which includes 
a wide range of the Grampians and the intervening 
landscape. As he proceeds, the Traveller will ob¬ 
serve, on his left, the parks and extensive planta¬ 
tions of Duncrub, the patrimonial seat, from remote 
ages, of the noble family of Rollo. Soon after, he 
enters Dunning, with its antique Belfry and its ve¬ 
nerable Thorn, coeval with the conflagration of the 
town by the clansmen of Charles-Edward in 1715. 

Dunning, by the name of Edyndonyng, was 
known as a barony in a. d. 1380. It was after¬ 
wards, on May 21st 1540, erected into a burgh of 
barony, dependent on the House of Duncrub, and 
at its fairs and other occasions still exhibits several 
of the ancient baronial customs. It is situated on 
the north base of the Ochels, is well built, contains 
nearly 1000 inhabitants, and has a neat comfortable 
appearance. A river, descending through a roman¬ 
tic dell from the hills, divides it, and falls into the 
Earn below the village. The communication be-

tween this place and Perth is maintained by means 
of two roads. At the south end of the bridge, one 
of these turns abruptly to the left, leaves the wood 
of Garvock on the right and Inverdunning on the 
opposite side, and stretching onward, with the pa¬ 
rish-church and village of Forteviot, an ancient re¬ 
sidence of the Pictish and Scottish monarchs, in 
front, crosses the Earn by the Bridge of Forteviot. 
Soon after, it passes the parks and gardens of Dup¬ 
lin, the seat of the Earl of Kinnoul, surrounded with 
extensive ranges of lofty trees. Advancing towards 
Aberdalgy-church, on the right, the traveller com¬ 
mands a very picturesque view of the finest part of 
Strath-Earn, the river, the Hill of Moncrieff, the 
distant village of Abernethy, with its Pictish towpr, 
the groon a wells of trie UcHels, and the conical peaks 
of the verdant Lomonds elevated above the interme¬ 
diate hills. Proceeding in an ascent, over more than 
a mile, the road begins to descend into that from 
Glasgow, by Stirling, to Perth, and affords an am¬ 
ple prospect of that town, and the spacious plain, 
bounded by an amphitheatre of mountains, on the 
north and the east. 

Another road giving off that to Kinross, through 
the village of New Pitcairn, and over the Ochels, 
bends to the left at the south end of Dunning, and 
winding round the base of the Din-Cnoc, a fine cir¬ 
cular eminence, passes on the right the house of 
Garvock, the seat of Mr. Graeme, in the parks of 
which are the remains of an ancient fort and camp. 
A mile beyond this, begins the princely wall and

porter’s lodges of Invermay, the charming residence 
of Colonel Belshes. Known in song, the Birks of 
Invermay command the admiration of all strangers. 
The house is a plain but elegant modern mansion, 
placed in contrast with an ancient pile, standing on 
the verge of a precipitous silvan ridge bathed by the 
May-water. The policies are extensive, laid out 
with exquisite taste, and combine in their diversified 
scenery whatever is beautiful, picturesque, and ro¬ 
mantic. The Humble-Bumble, ingulphed between 
stupendous rocks and their shady trees with the fine 
Fall of Muckersy, higher up the May, constitute 
objects of visit to the admirers of natural beauty. 
Serpentine walks traverse these woods in all direc¬ 
tion©, ami add to the pleasures of admiration those 
of comfort and delight. 

From the gate of Invermay the road is continued 
parallel to the wall, crosses the May by a strong 
bridge, from which, on the left, the kirk, manse, 
and village of Forteviot are seen on a rising ground. 
Leaving the wall, and passing the hamlet of Jack’s- 
chair, the tourist will enter the woods, and observe 
in succession, on the same hand, Newton, the seat 
of Mr. Oliphant of Condie ; Rossie, the residence of 
Colonel Oliphant; the village and church of Forgan- 
denny; and Freeland, the house of Lord Ruthven, 
the avenue to which is ornamented by two rows of 
lofty linden trees. Between Newton and Rossie, on 
the right, is the parish-manse; and, behind it, a fine 
green ridge of the Ochels, containing the Roman 
camp at Ardargie, the trenches and cairn of Castle- 




Pitcaithly.—Hill of Moncrieff. 329 

Law, and the Druidic Rocking-Stone of Dron, im- 
bounds the southern view. Next, on the left, is 
D unbarney-house, the property of Mr. Craigie, and 
more to east, between the road and river Earn, the 
manse and parish-church. On the opposite hand 
may be seen the house of Pitcaithly, its Inn and 
celebrated Wells, and beyond these, the parks and 
place of Kilgraston, belonging to Mr. Grant. Enter¬ 
ing the Bridge-of-Earn-village, the stranger will turn 
to the left, and, taking the great northern road from 
Edinburgh, cross the Earn by its bridge. Plaving 
on his right the House and Hill of Moncrieff, from 
the top of which is one of the richest views in Bri¬ 
tain, he will sweep along its base, and pass the 
meeting-house of Craig-End, beyond which the mul¬ 
tifarious scenery of the Vale of Tay begins to expand 
under his eye. While contemplating these objects, 
he will descend on Perth by a noble approach; and, 
leaving the depot for prisoners of war, an immense 
pile, which cost £120,000, on his right, will traverse 
the South Insh under the shade of its trees, and enter 
the town. 

Fertilized by the waters of its majestic river, the 
Vale of Tay presents many objects of attention to 
the admirer of picturesque beauty. The Tourist’s 
Guide consequently anticipates the gratification of 
his companion while examining the scenery of this 
delightful region. From the banks of Loch-Lomond 
he would therefore invite him to proceed along the 
western margin of that lake to Crianlaroch, and

thence, by the southern shore of Loch-Dochart, to 
the romantic village of Killinn. From visiting Loch- 
Earn and the slopes of Ben-Vorlich, a lone road will 
conduct his fellow-journeyer through the dreary 
dale of Glen-Ogle, to the same place situated on the 
Western extremity of Loch-Tay: and here let them 
explore the beauties of Kinnell, and the paternal 
dormitory of the chieftain Macnab, inumbrated by 
the thick foliage of its semi-insulated grove. 

Chief of the British rivers, the Tay derives its 
origin from the fountains of Braidalbane, on the 
confines of Lorn. At first denominated the Fillan, 
it guides a winding course of ten miles through the 
sweet irriguous valley of Strath-Fillan. Passing 
Tyndrum, it falls into Loch-Dochart, a small crys¬ 
talline mere, three miles long, whose shores exhibit 
much beautiful scenery. It contains an isle with an 
ancient castle, overhung by a vast silvan promon¬ 
tory ; and on its surface floats a green islet, 51 feet 
long and 29 broad. Issuing from this lake, the river, 
here named the Dochart, now glides along its cog- 
nominal Glen, and receiving from the north the wa¬ 
ters of the Lochy, at Killinn is lost in Loch-Tay, 
than which few inland lakes display a greater or 
more interesting variety of landscape. 

Loch-Tay is fifteen miles in length; its breadth 
varies from one to two miles. Woodlands and groves 
adorn its winding shores, which are populous and 
fertile, and diversified by the forms of the incumbent 
mountains. In September 1784, and July 1794, its 




Tributary streams to the Tay. 351 

waters* were observed to be in a state of violent 
agitation near the village of Kenmore. The ruins 
of a monastery, founded by Alexander I., give in¬ 
terest to a woody islet, situated not far from its 
eastern termination. Assuming the name of its pa¬ 
rent lake, the Tay proceeds from Kenmore to irri¬ 
gate the delightful and luxuriant valley around it, 
emphatically denominated the Paradise of the High¬ 
lands. This Caledonian Eden is highly cultivated: 
flourishing and extensive plantations ornament and 
enrich it; and it is sheltered by high mountains 
clothed with dusky forests, above which Ben-Law- 
ers (4015 feet high) rears its alpine summit to the 
sky. 

Gliding south-eastward, the Tay between Ken¬ 
more and Dunkeld is gradually augmented by the 
waters of many tributary streams. The Lyon soon 
joins it, with the congregated fountains of its native 
Glen. Enlarged by the torrents of the Garry, the 
Tilt, and the Bruar, famous for their wild scenery 
and the variety of their romantic cascades, the Tum- 
mel, rushing over numerous cataracts, pours into its 
current the floods of Loch-Rannoch and Loch-Ericht. 
Separating itself, as it proceeds, and again uniting, 
so as to form many beautiful islets, the Tay, having 
its banks overshadowed by dense umbrageous woods, 
flows on to Dunkeld and receives the waters of the 


* An account of this singular phenomenon, as it appeared in 1784, was 
published by Professor Playfair in the first volume of the Transactions of 
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, from the details of the Rev. Mr. Fleming, 
at that time minister of the parish of Kenmore.

rapid Braan. New broad, deep, and majestic, it 
advances towards Perth, increased by the Isla and 
the Almond, conveying the streamlets commingled 
with them in their course. Below that town, a no¬ 
ble and navigable river, it glides eastward between 
the Hills of Kinnoul and Moncrieff, beyond which 
it is joined by the Earn. It now expands into an 
ample estuary, three miles broad, whose shores are 
beautified by the wealth and exuberance of the con¬ 
tiguous valley. Passing Dundee, it consigns its 
mighty flood to the bosom of the German ocean. 

Kenmore and its vicinity combine a great variety 
of magnificent scenery. Its pellucid lake, its wind¬ 
ing river and baronial palace, * and its groves, wood¬ 
lands, and mountains, obtained the admiration of 
Burns, and were depicted by him, in the following 
lines, with a beauty and faithfulness of representation 
which cannot be improved. 

“ The meeting cliffs each deep-sunk glen divides. 

The woods, wild-scat ter’d, clothe their ample sides; 

Th’ outstretching lake, embosom’d ’mong the hills,

Th’ incessant roar of headlong tumbling floods.”—

along the south side of the Tay, to the ancient ca¬ 
pital of Caledonia. After an advance of three miles 
he will perceive on his right, Balfruich, an old cas¬ 
tle belonging to Lord Braidalbane, situated on the 
slope of a hill. At an equal distance farther, is 
Aberfeldie, near which stands Moness, the seat of 
Mr. Fleming, at the base of a sylvan mountain dis¬ 
tinguished by an exuberance of romantic scenery. 
Two miles beyond this, are the hamlet and Castle 
of Grandtully, the picturesque residence of Sir J. 
Stewart, on the right. On the opposite bank of 
the meandering river, is Weemyss-castle, belonging 
to Sir Niel Menzies, with its meadowy lawns in 
front, and its woody hill rising abrupt, steep, and 
stupendous, behind it. Beyond the village of Insh, 
Ballechan the property of Mr. Stewart is seen on 
the north bank of the Tay; and, a short way in ad¬ 
vance, is Balnaguard-Inn. Eastertyre the abode of 
Mr. Reid is a mile farther on; and, a little past it, 
are the kirk and village of Logierait, where was a 
seat of the chiefs of Athol in a former age. Having 
past through Port, the Tourist will observe, on his 
right, Kinnaird the property of Mr. Izett, and, soon 
afterwards, Glenalbert belonging to Mr. Bisset, 
placed at the base of a steep rock. He will then 
successively pass Dalguise the house of Mr. Stew¬ 
art, and the hamlets of Ballalochan and Dalmarnock. 
Proceeding three miles farther, he will cross the 
Braan, and, leaving the village of Inver, traverse 
the Tay by its new bridge and introduce himself to 
Dunkeld.

Dunkeld, occupying a picturesque and healthful 
site, at the base of a lofty hill, on the north bank of 
the Tay, was the capital of ancient Caledonia. Ken¬ 
neth I., in a. d. 84*9, made it an establishment of the 
Culdees, and built a church for their use. In this he 
deposited the relics of Columba, the patron saint of 
his progenitors. By David I. the Culdean college 
was converted into the seat of a catholic episcopate, 
ranking the first in Scotland. In after ages, some 
of its prelates acted conspicuous parts in the public 
transactions of the times. The immortality of Gavin 
Douglas, its good and learned bishop, throws a ray 
of glory around its name. 

** Dunkeld! no more thy heaven-directed chauul 
Within thy sainted wall may sound again: 

But thou, as once a poet’s favourite haunt. 

Shall live in Douglas’ pure Virgilian strain; 

While Time devours the castle’s towering wall, 

And roofless abbeys pine, low tottering to their fall." 

DYER. 

Dunkeld is a borough of barony dependent on 
the Duke of Athol, and has the privilege of holding 
six annual fairs. The remains of its abbey, once a 
splendid structure in the Gotho-Saxon style, are now 
much dilapidated. The choir of the cathedral has 
been converted into the parish-kirk, and modernized: 
the remainder of the nave, the tower, and two side 
aisles, are in ruins. In the cemetery which surrounds 
it is the grave of Mary Scott, for whose tombstone, 
in 1728, this singular epitaph was composed; and 
as it contains a statement of chronological facts, our 
readers will not be displeased at its insertion.

“ Stop, passenger, until my life you read; 

The living may get knowledge from the dead. 

Five times five years unwedded was my life; 

Five times five years I was a virtuous wife; 

Ten times five years I wept a widow’s woes; 

Now, tired of human scenes, I here repose. 

Betwixt my cradle and my grave were seen 
Seven mighty kings of Scotland and a queen; 

Full twice five years the commonwealth I saw. 

Ten times the subjects rise against the law; 

And, which is worse than any civil war, 

A king arraign’d before the subjects’ bar; 

Swarms of sectarians, hot with hellish rage. 

Cut off his royal head upon the stage. 

Twice did I see old Prelacy pull’d down. 

And twice the cloak did sink beneath the gown. 

I saw the Stuart race thrust out; nay, more, 

I saw our country sold for English ore; 

Our numerous nobles, who have famous been. 

Sunk to the lowly number of sixteen. 

Such desolations in my days have been, 

I have an end of all perfection seen.” 

Near the town of Dunk eld stands the ducal resi¬ 
dence of the noble family of Athol, imbowered by 
deep and majestic woods. Its gardens, cascades, 
extensive pleasure-grounds, and magnificent scenery, 
have given interest and celebrity to the place. Every 
Tourist visits and admires the Falls of the Braan, 
the Rumbling Bridge, and the Hall of Ossian. 

Ossian's Hall, also named the Hermitage, is a se¬ 
questered temple, constructed with much elegance 
and effect, at the termination of an ornamented walk 
on the banks of the Braan. Entering its vestibule, 
the visitant perceives before his view a fine painting 
of the Bard of Selma, with his hunting-spear, his 
faithful dog, his bow and arrows around him. The 
maids of Morven are represented as listening with 
attentive admiration while he raises to the tones of

his harp the song of other times. While the Stran¬ 
ger, impressed with sympathetic awe, contemplates 
the figure of the hoary sage, like some airy pheno¬ 
menon, it suddenly disappears, and he finds himself 
in an enchanted temple, deafened by the roar of 
waters, and terrified by the portentous gush of a 
bursting cataract. 

At a distance of about half a mile, on the banks 
of the Braan, is a cave, partly natural and partly 
artificial. It is called Ossian’s Cave, and might well 
have served as a retreat or occasional residence to the 
Celtic bard and warrior. On the side of the princi¬ 
pal apartment are the following lines, which seem to 
be the address of Malvina to the shade of Oscar. 

“ Oh! see that form which faintly gleams, 

’Tis Oscar come to cheer my dreams. 

Ah ! wreath of mist! it glides away; 

Stay, my lovely Oscar, stay. 

Awake, my harp, to doleful lays. 

And sooth my soul with Oscar’s praise.

And mix thy sighs and tears with mine.

Peace to the hero’s ghost he cries.” 

About a mile and a half above the hermitage is 
the Rumbling Bridge, nearly formed by nature, but 
finished by art. Under its arch the river makes a 
noble rush, precipitating itself about 50 feet between 
the two sides of the rock which supports the bridge. 
The scenery around is grand and sublime. 

Directing his course toward the south, the Tourist

may leave Dunk eld, crossing the Tay by its beautiful 
bridge, * and after a ride of six miles, near the middle 
of which stands Murthly, the seat of Sir John Stew¬ 
art, on the left, will arrive at the village of Auch- 
tergaven. Beyond this, with Galley-Banks-house 
on the right, he will cross the Shochie-bourn, and 
approach Luncarty, celebrated in ancient story for a 
victory wrested from the Danes in a. d. 976 , by our 
Scottish ancestors, directed and animated by the pa¬ 
triotic Hay, progenitor of the Earls of Kinnoul and 
Errol. Soon after this, he will traverse the Almond 
water, and obtain an interesting view, on his left, of 
the parks and palace of Scoone, t the princely resi- 

* The erection of this magnificent bridge was chiefly accomplished on 
dry land; and, when completed, the river’s course was turned under its 
five arches. One of these is 90, two are 34, and two 74 feet each, forming 
a stretch of 102 yards of exquisite masonry. It was constructed at an ex¬ 
pense exceeding £50,000, whereof government contributed a sixth part. 
The balance was defrayed by the munificence of the Duke of Athol. 

f Scoone was originally a favourite residence of the Scottish monarchs, 
and the scene of many splendid actions. At this place, a national council 
was held in a. d. 906. Here was performed the ceremony of crowning our 
ancient sovereigns; and here, from remote ages, stood their coronation-seat,

of which it was robbed by Edward I. in 1296, who placed it in Westminster- 
abbey, where it still remains. Seated on the mount of Scoone, amid his 
nobles and an applauding people, on March 29th, 1306, Robert the Bruce 
received the royal diadem of his country from the hands of Isabella, the 
magnanimous Countess of Buchan, whose patriotic heroism involved in 
misfortune her subsequent destiny. The abbey of Scoone, founded in 1114 
by Alexander I., and its palace, were destroyed at the Reformation, but the 
latter was soon rebuilt, and under its roof was l&gt;orn the late Lord Chief- 
Justice Mansfield, whose memory is still venerated over the world for the 
excellency of his wisdom and his virtues. On its site, the present earl has 
erected a princely edifice, in the Gothic style, show'ng a front 240 feet in 
length. Its gallery, 180 feet long, contains a valuable collection of paintings; 
and, in one of the apartments is a bed of flowered crimson velvet, the work¬ 
manship of which occupied the leisure hours of Mary Queen of Scots, during 
her confinement in Lochleven-castle, in 1567-8.

dence of the Earl of Mansfield, charmingly situated 
on the eastern bank of the Tay. Onward, Tulloch 
may be seen on his left; and Balhousie, belonging 
to the Earl of Kinnoul, on the opposite hand; after 
which, a fine sweep along the west side of the North 
Insh leads him into Perth. * 

Perth t appears to have been a retreat of the an¬ 
cient Caledonians, and occupied by Agricola, in 
a. d. 70, as a station of his troops, connected with 
other posts by some of those magnificent causeways, 
whose remains are still found, in demonstration of 
his superior genius and resources. Its beautiful river 
and spacious plain are understood to have drawn the 
exclamation from his advancing soldiers; Ecce Tiber! 
Ecce Campus Martius ! Behold the Tiber ! Behold 
the Field of Mars ! During the subsequent ages, 
it rose to be a place of considerable wealth, and a 
favoured residence of the Scottish kings. Many 
charters concerning the town, from 1106 to 1210, 
are still extant. On October 10th of the latter year, 
king William confirmed all its former privileges at 
Stirling. Strong fortifications defended it, and many 
heroic achievements were performed under its walls. 


* A road more circuitous by six miles, but greatly superior in the abun¬ 
dance and beauty of its picturesque scenery, conducts from Dunkeld to 
Perth along the north bank of the Tay, by Delvin, Stobhall, and Scoone, 
and enters the town by its stately bridge. 

f Perth, Latinized Bertha, as a topographical epithet seems to have been 
confirmed by the primitive Celts of Caledonia. In the Cymro-Celtic lan¬ 
guage, Perth signifies a thorn-bush, a brake, a thicket of wild thorns. Berth 
means what is fair, pleasant, ornamented, rich, beauteous. Either term 
may have possessed reference to the local phenomena which in primeval 
times distinguished the place.

Perth the scene of political troubles. 339 

Robert the Bruce, in 1308, headed the assailants who 
expelled from it a garrison of his country’s enemies. 
Between 1201 and 1459, it was the seat of fourteen 
national councils. Anteriorly to 1286, an extensive 
commerce with the Netherlands and other continental 
parts were maintained by its citizens, who were rich 
and enterprising. Aroused to enthusiasm by the pa¬ 
thetic eloquence of John Knox, the people of Perth, 
on May 11 , 1559, raised the standard of the Reforma¬ 
tion, to which Christianity and their country owe so 
many blessings. In l 600 , it was made the scene of 
Gowrie's conspiracy, from which history has not yet 
been able to remove its mysterious invelope. The 
town was also transiently occupied by the High¬ 
landers in 1715 and 1745. These circumstances and 
their dependent events contributed to the revival of 
its ancient activity. Its activity thus began, has con¬ 
tinued to improve. At present it is beautiful and 
wealthy, and includes a population of nearly 20,000 
inhabitants. 

Perth is built with elegance and regularity, and 
contains many objects worthy of the stranger’s obser¬ 
vation. Its bridge is built of fine sand-stone, at an 
expense of £26,476, and consists of nine arches, ex¬ 
tending over a clear w r ater-way of 589 feet 9 inches. 
The seminaries for the education of youth form a 
noble structure, placed in the centre of Rose-terrace, 
fronting the North-Insh. Its churches are plain and 
elegant. That in which John Knox preached his 
celebrated sermon, is now divided so as to form three 
parish-kirks. The Depot for Prisoners of War was

erected, in 1812, at the end of the South-Insh, be¬ 
tween the road and the river. It is adapted to the 
reception of 8000 soldiers, and is reckoned the most 
complete and healthy structure of the kind in Bri¬ 
tain. The New Jail and Public Offices are con¬ 
structed on a scale of magnitude and beauty suitable 
to the character of a rich and populous country. 

Strangers find amusement in making excursions 
to visit the manifold scenery with which the neigh¬ 
bourhood of Perth abounds. The Hills of Kinnoul 
and Moncrieff command such a variety and richness 
of view, that by Mr. Pennant the prospect from the 
summit of the latter was denominated the Glory of 
Scollatid. Scoone, Lynedoch cottage, Duplin, Pit- 
caithly, Invermay, Elcho and Kinfauns castles, with 
many other places adjacent to the town, are visited 
and admired by those whom curiosity or business 
conduct to the banks of the Tay. 

Delighted with his observation of the numerous 
and beautiful objects of curiosity in Perth and its 
vicinity, the Traveller will depart from that city, on 
his southerward journey. His road divides the 
South-Insh, and, traversing the intervening swell in 
a serpentine course, descends upon Craigend, with 
its meeting-house and manse. Approaching the 
Bridge of Earn, and passing on the left, Moncrieff- 
house, the residence of Sir David Moncrieff, at the 
base of its romantic hill it crosses the Earn, and 
stretches onward to Cross-Gates, leaving on the right 
Kilgraston and Pitcaithly, belonging to Mr. Grant, 
and Balmanno-castle, the property of Colonel Belshes

of Invermay. Placed on a green slope of the Ochels, 
on the hill-ground of Balmanno, is the Druidic 
Rocking-Stone of Fildie, in the parish of Dron. At 
Cross-Gates, the road makes an abrupt bend to the 
left, separating from its old line by the Weets of 
Baglie, and extends eastward to the miln and hamlet 
of Aberargie, on the Water of Farg. During this 
sweep, it commands a rich and expansive view of the 
banks of the Tay and Earn, embellished with many 
mansions of the gay and wealthy. In the distance, 
and situated at the foot of a lonely glen of the Och¬ 
els, stands Abernethy, * famous as the regal residence 
of Pictland, and as an early retreat of Christianity and 
of science. 

Bending again to the south, the road passes Pottie- 
House, pertaining to Mr. Murray of Ayton, on the 
left, and enters the solitary dell of Glen-Farg, which 
it permeates by a course, pleasantly serpentine, and 
skirted with scenery combining many of the traits 
exhibited by hilly regions. Emerging from this 
sweet and lonely vale, with its caves and meander¬ 
ing brook, the Journeyer soon reaches Damhead, 


* Nectan, in A. D. 460, founded a monastery at this place for the advan¬ 
tage of his recently converted Piets. It was afterwards erected into an 
episcopal see, and the seat of its metropolitan. Kenneth, king of Scotland, 
after his subjugation of the rival kingdom in 843, transferred the bishopric 
to St. Andrews, when the cathedral of Abernethy became a collegiate church 
and a university for the education of youth, superintended by the Culdean 
clergy. In 1273, it was erected into a priory of regular canons. At present it 
is an obscure village, holding the privileges of a burgh of barony, whereof 
Lord Douglas is superior. It contains an ancient tower, supposed to be of 
Pictish construction, 75 feet high, and 48 in external circumference at the 
base. In its vicinity also stands Macduff’s Cross.

having observed, on the right, Paris the seat of Mr. 
Hay, and on his opposite hand, the visible church of 
Arngask, surrounded by its cemetery on the summit 
of a verdant hill. More to east, may be seen the 
ancient castle of Balvaird, the property of the Earl 
of Mansfield, near which stands a rocking-stone of 
the Druids. Passing the small village of Creevy, the 
road soon reaches that of Blairathort, at which the 
Lomonds and Laigh of Kinross, with Loch-Leven 
laving the base of Benarty, and, beyond the Strath 
'of Leven, the Frith of Forth and the Bass-Isle, burst 
upon the view. It then descends through Nether- 
ton, leaves Hattonburn and its distillery belonging 
to Mr. Stein, on the right, and Arlary, the residence 
of Mr. Arnot, in the opposite direction. Beyond this, 
by a change of its course to south-west, it affords 
an interesting view of the remains of Burleigh-castle, 
with its Boss Tree and fading rows of venerable elms. 
By a bold and winding sweep it now enters Milna¬ 
thort, a cheerful little town, occupied by an indus¬ 
trious and intelligent population, and agreeably 
situated on the southern aspect of a sloping plain. 
Having crossed the Quiech by its bridge, and past 
the farm-house of Lathro, overlooking his right, 
the Traveller will soon find at Kinross a hospitable 
bourne to his excursive pilgrimage. 

Kinross is a place of immemorial origin, situated 
in 56° 15' N. and 3° 10' W. on the western shore of 
Loch-Leven, and contains nearly 2000 inhabitants. 
Adjacent to it, on the east, stands Kinross-House, 
the seat of Mr. Graham, ornamented by magnificent

ranges of umbrageous trees. Its ruinous castle, im¬ 
mortalized by the captivity of Mary, and the solitary 
Isle of St. Servan, the site of a Culdean abbey, give 
interest to the place, and secure the attention of vi¬ 
sitants. Here, therefore, let the Wanderer from 
Caledonia court rest and amusement till he be joined 
by his friend from Stirling, when their route may be 
continued to the capital. 

Having refreshed his body, perhaps fatigued with 
the journey, and exhilarated his mind, exhausted 
with contemplative admiration, the Traveller, whom 
we left behind, will pursue his route from Callender 
with renovated pleasure. He will soon cross the 
Keltie, which is formed of two rapid mountain 
streams, and falls into the Teith a little to the right. 
On its western branch is the romantic water-fall of 
Brac-Lin. Over this is thrown a rude and perilous 
bridge formed of fir-boards secured with a double 
parapet, which enables the trembling spectator to 
look down, from the giddy height of fifty feet, into 
a stupendous chasm confining the tempestuous eddies 
of a wildly foaming pool. On the one hand, is seen 
a darksome gully, through which the waters rush 
forth with impetuous violence, roaring as they hurry 
headlong down the precipice ; while jutting rocks, 
hanging in gloomy wildness, frown over the black 
estuating caldrons formed by the angry torrent. On 
the other, almost beneath the tremulous bridge, is 
observed the whirling and forceful rapidity of con¬ 
flicting currents among the excavated rocks, and, at

the same time, is heard the incessant roar of the 
thundering cataract. 

In advancing towards Stirling, the way is ren¬ 
dered agreeable by the interchange of seats adorning 
the varied landscape. The chief of these are Cam¬ 
busmore, belonging to Mr. Buchanan of Achlaisie, 
Ballachallan, once a seat of a family named Stuart, 
Callichat, and Cambus-Wallace, now Doun-Lodge, 
an elegant residence of Lord Doun, upon the left of 
the road. On the same side, is the rising village of 
Doun, the vicinity of which is famous for its apiaries 
and the excellence of its honey. The right bank of 
the Teith, stretching toward Stirling, is agreeably 
varied with wooded enclosures and gentlemen’s seats, 
pleasantly situated on eminences which command 
extensive prospects, or sheltered in some sweet soli¬ 
tude whose level lawn forms the verdant margin of 
the river, reflecting, as it moves slowly along, all the 
silvan charms of those beautiful retreats. The vil¬ 
lage of Doun will now be passed upon the left. 
The place has a general appearance of neatness, 
particularly in the eastern end. It derives consi¬ 
derable support from five annual fairs, held in the 
months of February, May, July, November, and De¬ 
cember, when a fine show of cattle, collected from 
the Highlands and Western Isles, is exposed for sale. 

Just before passing the Teith, over an ancient 
bridge of two arches, built in 1530 by Robert Spit- 
tal, tailor to James V., and before descending the 
rising ground on its eastern bank, an interesting

prospect is obtained of Doun-castle, now a pictu¬ 
resque ruin. It is situated on a gentle eminence, 
imbowered by a wood that hangs over the rivulet, 
which, here, sweeping round the level lawn below 
the castle, meets the Ardoch, a rapid stream, when 
both flow slowly on till they fall into the Forth. On 
both sides of the river, its banks are finely wooded, 
and rise in romantic swells. In the distance Craig- 
Forth, Stirling-castle, and the highest of the Ochels, 
seem admirably placed for the composition of a pic¬ 
ture, of which the foreground will be occupied by 
the nearer banks of the Teith, passing beneath his 
eye with a free and noble volume of water. 

As he proceeds, the Tourist will see on the left a 
deep dell, which appears to have been the rugged 
course of a stream that has either become dry or 
changed its channel. Passing the road, upon the 
right, which leads to the Lake of Monteith, Loch- 
Ard, Loch-Conn, and the Fort of Inversnaid, by 
Thornhill, a village once celebrated for making 
whisky, he will approach the pleasure-grounds of 
Blair-Drummond, the property of Mr. Home Drum¬ 
mond, the son of the late illustrious Lord Karnes. 
Beyond this is the Moss of Kincardine, formed by 
the decayed remains of the ancient Caledonian Wood. 
To the right, his attention will be attracted by a 
piece of machinery at the Mill of Torr. This con¬ 
sists of a great wheel, so constructed as to raise wa¬ 
ter, which is conveyed in an opposite direction to 
that whence it proceeds, to the neighbouring moss, 
for the purpose of washing it away into the Forth, 




346 Ochtertyre.—Stirling. 

and, by this means, of clearing, to the depth of from 
3 to 12 feet, a valuable and extensive tract of arable 
ground which it covers. This wheel is the inven¬ 
tion of Mr. Meikle of Alloa, an engineer of great 
ingenuity, to whom this country is indebted for 
many useful improvements in mechanics. 

Beyond this and upon the left, is Ochtertyre, 
pleasantly situated on the eastern bank of the Teith, 
which here forms the most considerable branch of 
the Forth. Mr. Ramsay, the learned proprietor of 
this estate, has greatly improved it. He has also, 
like the tender Shenstone, led the muses to his bow¬ 
ery dwelling, with the languages in which they 
were formerly wooed by the Greek and Roman 
bards. There is scarcely an avenue, grot, arbour, 
or resting-place, in which some elegant inscription 
from one or other of the favourite authors of anti¬ 
quity, is not to be met with, in traversing the plea¬ 
sure-grounds of Ochtertyre. 

Hie gelidi fontes, hie mollia prata, Lycori! 

Hie uemus, hie ipso tecum consumerer aevo. 

On arriving at the Bridge of Dript, the confines 
of Perthshire, the stranger will command an inter¬ 
esting prospect of Stirling-castle and the adjacent 
scenes, the most conspicuous of which is Craig-Forth 
on the right, with its silvan cliffs impending over 
the river, which here glides slowly along its'base, 
and coming into the foreground together with the 
bridge, give much interest to the landscape. Leav¬ 
ing this, he will by a winding road immediately be¬ 
neath the crags of the Castle enter Stirling, an an- 




Cambus-Kenneth.—Arthrie—Village of Logie. 347 

cient town, containing about 6000 inhabitants, and 
will there find agreeable society, hospitable enter¬ 
tainment, and refreshing repose. 

Having accompanied the Tourist thus far on his 
homeward route, the inclination which makes “ old 
friends loath to part ” excites a desire in “ the 
guide ” to become his companion even to the Cale¬ 
donian capital. Supposing, then, that his westering 
way led him by Linlithgow, Falkirk, and Cumber¬ 
nauld, or Kilsyth, to Glasgow, it will be the object 
of what remains of this part of the Sketch, to lead 
him, though by a devious tract, through a more in¬ 
teresting country. This will be by what is called 
the Hill-foot-road to Kinross. With this view, he 
will cross the Forth by its venerable bridge, built 
in the ninth century, and wind round the northern 
base of the Abbey-Craig, so named from the Abbey 
of Cambus-Kenneth, situated a little to the south, 
upon a peninsula formed by a bend of the river, and 
commanding a fine view of the numerous meander- 
ings of the Forth. He will soon pass, on the left, 
Arthrie, the seat of General Sir Robert Abercromby, 
and, in succession, the church and romantic village 
of Logie, at the base of Dunmait, a lofty point of the 
Ochels, from which a beautiful prospect is obtained 
of twelve counties. From this a good road stretches 
immediately under the hills all the way to Dollar, a 
distance of ten miles. In his progress, he will have 
an opportunity of contemplating, upon his right, a 
fertile country, through which flows the Devon, and 
in which are situated Shaw-Park, the property of the

548 Tillibody.—Dollar.—Castle-Campbell. 

Earl of Mansfield, and Tillibody, the seat of the wi¬ 
dow of the illustrious Sir Ralph Abercromby, with 
several other mansions, situated amid spacious woods. 
On the left, he will observe the house and village of 
Menstrie, Alva-house, belonging to Mr. Johnston, 
and the place of the same name, Tillicoultry-house, 
the property of Mr. Bruce, and Harvieston, a neat 
modern residence, built and occupied by Mr. Tait, 
a gentleman of much enterprise and public spirit. 
Throughout the whole of this part of his excursion, 
indeed, the Traveller will be charmed with a perpe¬ 
tually varying interchange of lofty romantic rocks, 
finely wooded mountains, dashing cataracts, benty 
wilds, and silvan dells; for, throughout the whole 
range, 

“ Green wave the woods on Ochel’s brow. 

And rustle in the mid-sky breeze. 

Where many a bird on many a bough. 

With songs of love attune the trees. 

By yonder grots, where echoes dwell. 

And bursts th’ aurora’s golden blow. 

The rarest plant in frith or fell. 

Ramps on her oak the mistletoe. 

Gray tower yon ridges, roan and bare. 

On which the wild tornadoes war. 

And capt with clouds, sublime in air. 

They, picturesque, upclimb afar.” 

Kennedy's Glenochel. 

On arriving at Dollar, the Stranger will be invited 
by a distant view, to ascend the hill and contemplate 
the singular scenery of Castle-Campbell, still sublime 
in ruin. Having surveyed, with astonishment and 
pleasure, this most romantic assemblage of almost 
every thing grand in nature, he will proceed on 




Falls on the Devon.—Kinross-house.—Blair-Adam. 549 

his journey, and passing Castleton, a small turreted 
building upon an eminence on the left, he may soon 
after turn off to the right, when a footpath will con¬ 
duct him to the Caldron-Linn, a celebrated cataract 
on the Devon. Proceeding up the river side, he will 
also have an opportunity of visiting the Rumbling 
Bridge and Devil’s Mill, with their wild, woody, and 
rocky accompaniments. A short way beyond these, 
is the village of the Crook of Devon, from which a 
good road through an improving country will lead 
him to Kinross. This place is beautified by the ex¬ 
tensive pleasure-grounds of Kinross-house, the mag¬ 
nificent mansion of Mr. Graham, and by the charming 
expanse of Loch-Leven, celebrated afar for the scenes 
of its insulated towers. The Tourist must visit these, 
and while he heaves a sigh over the sorrows of the 
ill-requited Mary, will be taught a useful lesson of 
the transitory nature of human grandeur. The long 
low Isle of St. Servan presents few attractions, but 
may excite the Stranger’s attention by having been 
the seat of primitive Christianity, and, perhaps, the 
secluded spot where Winton composed his chronicle 
of the northern division of the British Isle. 

Taking the road to Edinburgh, the Traveller will 
soon observe, on his right, Blair-Adam, the seat of 
Mr. W. Adam, situated on the woody declivity of the 
Cleish hills, and his right will be overlooked by the 
western peak of Benarty, rearing its bare and rugged 
head, with a threatening frown, above the adjacent 
vale. As he passes onward, he will successively leave 
the villages of Maryborough and Keltie, the Kirk of

Arrival at Edinburgh.—Return to Arroquhar. 


Beath on the summit of an eminence, the Crossgates, 
and the ancient town of Inverkeithing, not far be¬ 
yond which is the North Queen’s-ferry. Crossing 
the Forth, he will proceed to Cramond Bridge, hav¬ 
ing the fine enclosures of Lord Roseberry the whole 
way on his left. From this, the road is bounded by 
views, charmingly varied, till, by the west end of 
Prince’s-street, the Tourist completes his most diver¬ 
sified excursion by entering the Caledonian Metro¬ 
polis, peopled by above 83,000 inhabitants. 

Having resigned his late charge to the comforts of 
the capital, “ the stranger’s guide ” hastens his 
return to the Inn of Arroquhar, in the hope of being 
in time to share the Deoch an JDorais with his late 
companion, before departing on his western route. 
Arroquhar was formerly the residence of the chiefs 
of the Clan-Macfarlan, but is now the property of 
Mr. Ferguson of Raith, in Fifeshire. The Duke of 
Argyle having obtained a lease of it, made several 
additions to the original buildings, and converted it 
into an inn, which is a convenient stage on the way 
to Inveraray. Its situation is very romantic; it com¬ 
mands a fine view of Loch-Long, and is enveloped 
in woods and overlooked by lofty hills. From one 
of the windows is seen Ben-Ardtir, a grotesque rock 
which, from its appearance, has obtained the appel¬ 
lation of The Cobbler . Anciently it was reckoned 
the highest spot within the domain of the Campbells, 
and the heir of that house was obliged to ascend its 
topmost pinnacle as a proof of his having taken

possession. If he failed, his right devolved to the 
nearest relative who should happen to be more ad¬ 
venturous. 

Loch-Long is an arm of the sea, 20 miles long, and 
from 40 to 80 fathoms deep, dividing the shire of 
Dunbarton from that of Argyle. It is frequented by 
herrings, and abounds in the various species of fish 
found in similar waters. This lake is remarkable in 
having been the scene of a Norwegian depredation. 
In a. d. 1263 , Haco, king of Norway, sent a fleet of 
sixty sail up towards its head, where the crews 
landed, and ravaged the country round the shores 
of Loch-Lomond, together with its ff ilis, then weil 
biggit with kirkis, templis, and housisdestroyed 
much property, and carried away a multitude of cat¬ 
tle. From this he sailed down the Frith of Clyde, 
and landed on the coast of Ayrshire. Here he was 
completely routed by Alexander III. the young king 
of Scots, and 26,000 of the ravagers were slain in 
the decisive battle of Largs. * „

Hardyknule. 


* The scene of this action is still marked with some monumental cairns, 
many of which, however, have been removed during the glide of ages. In 
most of them were found stone coffins enclosing human bones, and battle- 
axes, two of which have gone into the possession of General Brisbane. In 
the Cumbrae Isles, some cairns, reared on the same occasion, being lately 
opened, the warlike weapons contained in them were placed in the collection 
of the Earl of Eglinton.

552 Sublime scenery of Glencroe. 

Stretching for about two miles along the northern 
banks of the lake, and having the rugged rocks of 
Ben-Ardtir upon the right, then turning to the left, 
till coming within view of Ardgartan, the property 
of Campbell of Strachur, beautifully seated upon a 
finely wooded plain between the lake and the moun¬ 
tains, the road bends to the right, and in the vicinity 
of Strongarton, a small farm-house, enters the dreary 
dale of Glencroe. The scenery of this silent and 
sequestered spot is in the highest degree sublime. 
On each side are mountains, the most steep and 
rugged, with rocks hanging over their cliffy sides, 
and threatening destruction to the traveller below. 
In some places, their craggy tops appear almost to 
meet above the head; in others, the valley is more 
expanded, and exhibits patches of vegetation covered 
with flocks of sheep. Along the middle of the glen 
flows the noisy current of a troublous brook, formed 
by the numerous rills, that tumble in the form of 
cascades, from its precipitous sides. A few solitary 
shepherds constitute the dwellers of this lonely re¬ 
treat. 

Glencroe is from four to five miles in length, and 
the road ascends gently through the whole of it, 
excepting the last mile, where it is very steep, and 
carried in a zigzag form to the top of the hill. Here 
is a seat and a stone inscribed

placed by the 22d regiment, who made this part of

the military road. * Emerging from the glen, but 
still surrounded by stupendous hills, the Tourist will 
pass the small lake Loch-Restal, which empties itself 
by a furious streamlet, dashing in cataracts through 
Glen-Kinglass for many a weary mile. Both sides 
of it are washed by innumerable rills, and towards 
its termination it is beautified by woods, relieving 
the eye with the verdure of their foliage. Having 
traversed this lone valley, a view is obtained of Loch- 
Fyne, an extensive arm of the sea, more than thirty 
miles in length. Upon the opposite side of the river 
which accompanies the road, and where it bends to 
the right, stands Ardkinglas, the seat of Sir A. Camp¬ 
bell, possessing every ornament which mountain, 
w'ood, water, and the contrast of a ruinous pile can 
bestow. About a mile and a half beyond this is the 
inn of Cairndow; not far beyond which, the road 
doubles the extremity of the lake, and proceeds along 
its margin, skirted with a noble range of mountains, 
which, although naked and bare, gain in grandeur 
what they lose in beauty. Upon a low peninsula, 
distant six miles from Cairndow, and four from In¬ 
veraray, stands Dunduramh, encompassed by lofty 
trees, and consisting of a large, strong, irregularly 
constructed tower, with small turrets above the angles

As the road advances, the lake grows wider, ex¬ 
tending towards the right, when the prospect begins 
gradually to open; and, on passing a steep hill on 
the right, a most enchanting landscape bursts unex¬ 
pectedly upon the view. The lake here expands 
into a spacious bay, round which are ranged the 
beautiful plantations of the Duke of Argyle, stretch¬ 
ing from the margin of the water to the summits of 
the high mountains behind. The castle, rearing its 
towers above the thick woods, has a picturesque and 
agreeable effect; while towards the south-east appears 
the town of Inveraray in a uniform line of handsome 
buildings. On the right is seen Dunicoich, a steep 
hill 700 feet perpendicular, covered with wood, and 
crowned by an ancient watch-tower. This delight¬ 
ful scenery continues in view during nearly an hour, 
but when the traveller has reached the inn, the whole 
has almost evanished from the view, like the flitting 
beauties of a fairy scene. 

Inveraray, which now contains about 1200 inhabi¬ 
tants, originated in a hamlet formed by the humble 
habitations of fishermen. In 1648, by the interest 
of the noble family of Argyle, it was erected b y 
Charles I. into a burgh, of which the revenues, even 
at this day, do not much exceed £60 per annum. 
The place is small, consisting chiefly of one range of 
neat houses, uniformly built, and fronting the lake. 



Description of Inveraray-castle. 355 

The whole, excepting one house, is the property of 
the duke. 

The present castle of Inveraray was begun about 
1745, by Archibald, Duke of Argyle, but on account 
of the commotions of the times, it was not completed 
for many years afterwards. It is surrounded by 
most extensive pleasure-grounds, stocked with a re¬ 
dundance of the finest woods to be seen within the 
British Isles. Through the lawn before the castle, 
the Aray, a fine and rapid river, flows into the lake. 
The noble mansion is a square building, with a tower 
at each corner, and a high glazed pavilion shooting 
up above the towers from the centre of the roof, which 
gives the whole an appearance well suited to the 
scene. It relies on its own merits and its situation 
to attract the attention of the traveller, and presents 
no white or splendid colour to the eye, forming an 
ostentatious contrast to the shady groves around it; 
but its gray, sombre hue harmonizes with the scene, 
and gives to the whole an air of tranquil dignity. 
The hall, which is spacious, is hung round with 
arms and other ornaments, suited to the style of a 
highland castle. It is lighted by the high middle 
windows, and surrounded by a gallery, in which is 
an organ, the effect of which is grand and striking. 
This i 3 the largest room in the mansion, and perhaps 
the only one perfectly corresponding to the magni¬ 
ficent exterior. The others are all fitted up in the 
modern style, with exquisite taste; and the large 
drawing-room is a princely apartment, adorned with 
beautiful tapestry. Those in the turrets are used 





356 Scenery in the vicinity of Inveraray. 

chiefly as small libraries, or private parlours, and are, 
in general, ornamented with good prints. The pic¬ 
tures, for the most part, are not excellent, excepting 
a few portraits, among which is a fine one of the late 
Duke of Hamilton. Some others will attract notice 
from historical incidents wherewith their originals 
were connected. 

Having seen what is remarkable about the castle, 
the Stranger may walk along the side of the Aray, 
which he will cross by a bridge; when, by keeping 
to the right, he will come to a spot at the base of Du- 
nicoich, near a gate leading to an avenue. Here he 
will obtain a beautiful view of the castle, town, and 
lake. A winding walk conducts, from this place, 
to the summit of the hill, from which may be con¬ 
templated, in a delightful prospect, the whole of the 
Duke’s pleasure-grounds, extending thirty miles in 
circumference. 

-“ Hail! Nature, hail! 

With all thy woods and rivers, winding lone, 

That wander down and skirt the hermit-vale. 

With oak high-crown’d, and yellow leaflets strown; 

’Tis there the mind can feel a deeper tone. 

And muse on npbler deeds—the stream that brawls 
Unheeded joins the melancholy moan 
Of groves—no sound the distant world recals. 

None heard but dew that weeps, none but the leaf that falls.” 

Finlay's Wallace. 

If the Traveller decline, however, to ascend the 
steep, he may proceed through the alley beneath the 
shade of its majestic trees. Walking about a mile 
onward, he will come in sight of the Dubh-Loch, a 
deep and dark fresh water lake, communicating, at 
a short distance, by a little rivulet, with Loch-Fyne. 





The Dubh-Loch.—The Duke’s drying barns. 357 

This pool is abundantly stocked with excellent fish, 
from which the family is always amply supplied. It 
is situated at the bottom of a very picturesque vale, 
named Glen-Shira, expressive of the qualities of its 
silent stream. In this romantic seclusion, at about 
two miles distance from the town, are the Duke’s 
Barns for drying hay and grain in wet seasons, and 
well deserving a visit from those who are curious of 
contemplating the progressive improvements of art, 
and the ingenuity of philanthropy exercised in alle¬ 
viating the disadvantages of an ungenial clime. 

In the centre of the town of Inveraray is a monu¬ 
ment erected to the memory of seventeen gentlemen 
of the name of Campbell, who were murdered there 
by the myrmidons of the government, after the sup¬ 
pression of the Duke of Monmouth’s partizans, in 
1685, among whom was the amiable and patriotic 
Earl of Argyle. It contains an inscription comme¬ 
morating, with a moderation that does honour to the 
writer, the justice of the cause in which his relatives 
fell.

Between the Town-house and the Inn, both which 
are handsome buildings, there is an iron gate, open¬ 
ing into a long dark avenue of aged elms, and lead¬ 
ing to Essachosan, a gloomy and romantic glen about 
two miles distant. On the way the Marriage Tree , 
a large linden, will be pointed out as a curiosity in 
the vegetable kingdom. It consists of two branches, 
divided only a few feet above the ground, and grown 
to so immense a magnitude, that their weight must, 
long ago, have separated them, but for a strong 
branch which has been pushed out, at the height of 
about twenty feet, by one of the main trunks, and 
ingrafted firmly into the other. Hence the name has 
originated. At the end of the Glen is a pretty cas¬ 
cade ; and roebucks frequent the woody hills that 
surround it. 

On the river Aray are some romantic waterfalls, 
the chief of which are, the Carlonan Linn, and Len-

ach Gluthin, which is the most beautiful, and is 
higher up the stream. On the Douglas, a rivulet 
falling into Loch-Fyne about three miles below the 
town, is a bridge said to be of Roman structure, which 
is very picturesque from its form and the pendent 
weeds, foliage, and ivy with which it is covered. 

In returning from Inveraray, it is necessary either 
to retrace the road to Arroquhar and, doubling Loch- 
Fyne, descend by its eastern bank, or to cross by 
water to St. Catherine’s Inn on the opposite shore. 
Those who choose the first of these ways, leave the 
road conducting to Loch-Lomond, at the Inn of Ar¬ 
roquhar ; and, passing the church and manse upon 
the left, proceed through a woody track of land 
sometimes interrupted by high precipices, along the 
eastern shores of the lake. At a small hamlet named 
Finart, the road bends to the left, and ascends a 
steep hill, from whose summit is an open and exten¬ 
sive prospect all around. While ascending still far¬ 
ther, the Traveller obtains a view of Loch-Goyle, 
branching out from Loch-Long among the north¬ 
western mountains. By turning a little towards the 
right out of the way, he will have a fine prospect of 
the Loch, with the ancient Castle-Carrick near its 
opening on the south, and the houses of Portincaple 
on its eastern margin, in the front. At a short dis¬ 
tance from this, on the road, a soft and beautiful 
prospect rises on the eye, from the south, consisting 
of the v lair-Loch, issuing from the Frith of Clyde, 
with mountains on every side, the distant castle of 





360 The Gair-Loch.—Faslane.—ArdenconneU.—Ardencaple-inn. 


Roseneath, and the hills of Renfrewshire blending 
with the sky. 

At the extremity of the Gair-Loch, which enters 
seven miles into the land, the road inclines to the left, 
skirts along its eastern shore, and soon passes Fas¬ 
lane, a mansion belonging to Sir James Colquhoun, 
near which are the ruins of an ancient chapel, with 
brushwood and trees overshading its moss-covered 
walls. A picturesque mill and cottages are soon 
after to be passed, and beyond these, Ardenconnell, 
the property of Mr. Buchanan, situated upon the 
sloping side of a hill. Below this stands the church 
of Row surrounded by trees. Proceeding along the 
shore of a pleasant bay decorated with wood upon 
the left, the traveller, while contemplating the fine 
view he now has of Roseneathand its charming groves, 
will arrive at Ardencaple-inn, at the mouth of that 
estuary, the shores of which he has just surveyed. 

But the Wanderer may not be inclined to follow so 
circuitous a route, and will, therefore, from Inveraray 
cross Loch-Fyne to St. Catherine’s Inn, and proceed 
through Hell-Glen to the point of Loch-Goyle, 
which breaks inland to the distance of twenty miles. 
The road thence conducts him along its banks, at the 
base of a long range of elevated mountains, to the 
point of the promontory formed by its separation from 
Loch-Long. Overlooking this vast headland is the 
exalted, flat-topped ridge, named Argyle’s Bowling- 
green, of a grotesque and irregular outline, giving 
singularity and interest to this mountainous range. 




Roseneath-castle.—Ardencaple-inn. 361 

The Stranger will now cross the Lake to Portin- 
caple; and, continuing his route along the western 
shore of the Gair-Loch, will arrive at Roseneath, 
standing on a delightful woody peninsula washed, 
on the south, by the Clyde, here, a broad and mag¬ 
nificent stream. This splendid edifice belongs to the 
Duke of Argyle. Here stood, anciently, a fine old 
castle, which was burnt down by accident in the 
summer of 1802. Soon after, the present mansion 
was begun, from a design by the late Joseph Bonomi, 
an eminent architect of London, but has not yet been 
completed. It is 184 feet long and 121 in breadth, 
having two magnificent fronts, each adorned with co¬ 
lumns of the Ionic order, and the whole is projected 
on a plan of princely grandeur. Retired from the 
house, and nearly concealed with woods, are the offices, 
280 feet in length, and ornamented with a tower 90 
feet high, designed equally for decoration and for use. 
The plan was given by Mr. Naysmith, a distinguished 
landscape-painter in Edinburgh. 

At the village of Roseneath, the Tourist will easily 
procure a boat in which to cross the Loch to Ar- 
dencaple-inn. From this a short distance, in which 
lie will pass Ardencaple-house, the property of the 
Duke of Argyle, on the left, will bring him to He¬ 
lensburgh on the northern bank of the Clyde. This 
place was founded about thirty-five years ago, by Sir 
James Colquhoun, on whose estate it stands. Of late 
it has become a favourite retreat of the merchants and 
manufacturers of Glasgow, Greenock, and Paisley, 
during the months of summer. This has occasioned

a rapid increase of its population, which is now esti¬ 
mated at 600 permanent inhabitants. During the 
sea-bathing season, however, there are four times 
that number. A theatre has been erected in the 
place, together with a large hotel, and extensive hot 
and cold baths, containing every accommodation for 
invalids. The baths and dependent buildings are 
designed on a spacious scale, and form a handsome 
structure. The town is built on a uniform plan, 
and was erected, some years ago, into a borough of 
barony, the affairs of which are directed by its own 
magistrates. Some progress has also been made in 
constructing a small harbour for the reception of 
fishing vessels and pleasure-boats. Many of the 
private lodgings are handsomely finished and fur¬ 
nished, which, with the salubrity of the air, the 
moderate distance from Glasgow, the excellence of 
the road, and the convenience of a daily post, ren¬ 
der this a desirable retreat to all who may wish a 
temporary repose from the cares and confinement of 
business. 

From Helensburgh an excellent road, through a 
pleasant country, leads to Dunbarton. It passes, on 
the left, Drumfork the seat of Mr. Laird, Camis 
Eskan belonging to Mr. Dennistoun, Keppoch the 
residence of Mr. Ewing, and Lileston the property 
of Mr. Donald. On the right is the peninsulated 
Hill of Ardmore, upon which stands the conspicu¬ 
ous mansion ot General Giles, farther on is Ardarden 
occupied by Mr. Neilson, and then, upon the left is 
Gileston, the abode of Mr. Lennox. On the same side 





Seat of Robert the Bruce.-—Dunbarton. 363 

stands the church of Cardross, and, not far beyond it, 
Ardoch, the fine cottage of Mr. Graham of Gartmore. 
At a short distance in advance, and on the left of 
the road, some trees distinguish the remarkable spot 
where stood a seat of the most valorous and virtuous 
Robert the Bruce, * and in which the illustrious pa¬ 
triot died. On the right of where the road unites 
with that conducting to Loch-Lomond, stands Clyde¬ 
bank, on the headland formed by the confluence of 
the Leven and the Clyde. The Traveller will now 
enter Dunbarton by a massy bridge, which was built 
above fifty years ago by government, and cost £2500. 
It is upwards of 300 feet long, and 25 high, m the 
centre above the surface of the river, and contains 
five arches, the largest of which is 162 feet in span. 
On the Leven is a salmon-fishery, let for about £350 
per annum. It belongs to Sir James Colquhoun of 
Luss and the borough of Dunbarton, From this 
place, if he prefer it, the Traveller may retrace his 
late route to the city of Glasgow. 

But the town of Greenock invites a visit from 
him whose leisure permits, and whom philanthropy 
prompts to investigate and admire the progress of the 


* In February 1818, when the workmen in the Psalter churchyard at 
Dunfermline were preparing the ground for a new church, a tomb, supposed 
to be that of this celebrated king, was discovered. There was a large trough, 
built of polished stone, about seven feet in length, and eighteen inches in 
depth: in this trough lies the skeleton of a large body, six feet two inches 
in length, in considerable preservation, cased in lead- The body has been 
wrapped in damask cloth, extremely fine, and interwoven with gold, some 
fragments of which remain; and something like a crown was observed upon 
the head. Several fragments of marble, cased and gilt, were dug from the 
ruins in the immediate neighbourhood of the tomb, which in all probability 
.are the remains of the monument that had been erected over it.

arts, manufactures, and commerce, in the maritime 
divisions of Great Britain. This Sketch, however, 
must fall greatly short of doing justice to the public- 
spirit of the inhabitants of this enterprising, wealthy,' 
and flourishing place. A few brief notes are, never¬ 
theless, submitted with a view to excite the inquiries 
of the Stranger, and to direct his attention to a sur¬ 
vey of the place, which is now become one of the 
most considerable seaports in the British Empire. 

Greenock is situated on a spacious bay, extending 
four and a half miles along the southern bank of the 
Clyde. It is joined on the east by Crawford’s Dyke, 
which was erected into a borough of barony, in 
1633, by Charles I., and has a good harbour and 
quay older than those of Greenock. In 1700, the 
inhabitants petitioned the Scottish Parliament to 
sanction the establishment of a fund wherewith to 
build a harbour. The request, however, was refused, 
probably on account of opposition from the royal 
boroughs and the merchants of Glasgow. But they 
were not to be diverted from so laudable a project 
by the interposition of a jealous and invidious rivalry. 
They afterwards entered into a contract with their 
superior Sir John Shaw, and agreed to assess them¬ 
selves in the sum of Is. 4d. sterling on each sack of 
malt brewed into ale within the town. A harbour 
was, in consequence, begun in 1707; and more than 
ten acres were enclosed by two circular quays, with 
the intervention of a middle one; the whole consist¬ 
ing of about 2000 feet of stone work, executed at 
the expense of £5625 sterling. This debt having 






Comrnerce of Greenock. 365 

alarmed the projectors, they were induced to trans¬ 
fer the harbour, with the tax, to their superior, on 
condition of his becoming surety for the payment. 
Their trade, however, increased so rapidly, that in 
1740 the whole was paid, and a considerable sum re¬ 
mained wherewith to form a fund to the community. 
Since that time, the harbour has been enlarged on a 
splendid scale, and dry docks built. Ship-building 
is also carried on here to a very great extent; which, 
with the other pursuits of its merchants, have ren¬ 
dered this a place of great opulence and vast com¬ 
mercial enterprise. The road or outer harbour is 
narrowed by a sand-bank of considerable breadth, 
stretching from Dunbarton to a short distance below 
the town. At the bottom or tail of the bank, and 
which, as a loosing place, experienced mariners pre¬ 
fer to any other in the Frith, there is, at all times, 
sufficient depth of water, abundance of room, and 
good anchoring for hundreds of ships of any burden. 
Opposite to this, on the south, is erected a battery 
to command the entrance into the Clyde. 

As large capitals have been acquired by the inha¬ 
bitants of Greenock, their trade is proportionately 
extensive. Their imports consist chiefly of cotton, 
sugar, rum, grain, wine, naval stores, potass, oil, 
timber, fruits, and other articles for home consump¬ 
tion. The exports are chiefly composed of the ge¬ 
neral produce of the great manufacturing country 
upon the river. The whale and herring fisheries 
have long been engaged in, here, to a considerable 
extent. The manufactures are not very numerous. 


2 h 3 







Public buildings. 


366 

consisting chiefly of ship-building, of cordage, sail¬ 
cloth, sugar-refining, bottle-works, and a few others. 
The population of Greenock, which nearly amounts 
to 20,000 souls, has been greatly augmented by the 
influx of highlanders, whom the iron hand of an ig¬ 
norant and ungenerous policy has expatriated even 
from the ungenial haunts of their naked hills. 

Greenock was only a country parish till about the 
year 1745, when its increase was so great, that a new 
parish became necessary, and was erected. The town 
stands on a narrow level plat, immediately behind 
which the hills, formerly covered with close woods, 
swell to the height of 800 feet above the surface of 
the sea. Like other sea-ports, it is not remarkable 
for the elegance of its appearance, but exhibits the 
nobler traits of happiness, wealth and industry, the 
offspring of an active commercial spirit, directed by a 
just and liberal policy. The Town-house is a consi¬ 
derable fabric, and the New Church, in the centre of 
the place, built in 1758, is a large and stately edifice. 
The Tontine and Inn are constructed of ashler work, 
of which the architecture is chaste and beautiful. 
The subscription-paper for erecting them, to the 
amount of £ 10,000 sterling, was, with a character¬ 
istic spirit, filled up in the space of two days. A 
neat building has been erected, on the same prin¬ 
ciples, for the reception of the Public Subscription 
Library, which has existed during a number of years, 
and contains a select collection of excellent books in 
the various departments of literature. The chaste 
structure in which the departments of the Custom- 







Custom-house and Excise-office. 


36 7 


house and Excise-office are to be conducted, is built 
in the pure Grecian style, from a design by Mr. Burn. 
The entire building, which will cost about &lt;£30,000, 
is 170 by 100 feet, and is greatly ornamental to the 
town. In the foundation-stone is a plate containing 
this inscription.

Greenock likewise possesses a neat small Theatre. 
By the advance of property, and especially of ground 
for building, occasioned by the great increase of 
population, the minister of the old parish has feued 
his glebe, and thereby augmented his stipend to 
nearly &lt;£1000 per annum, being the largest in Scot¬ 
land. Specimens of copper have been discovered in 
a hill behind the town, and some appearances indicate 
that attempts may have been made to work the vein. 
In the hill, also, are some remarkable caverns which 
have been converted into reservoirs for collecting wa¬ 
ter for the use of the inhabitants. Overlooking the 
town from the south-west is Greenock-house, the seat 
of Sir John Shaw Stewart, situated on the acclivity

of the hill, and shaded bv fine old trees. Greenock 

/ w 

is governed by two baillies and six counsellors. 

A charming walk of about three miles, and in the 
course of which may be observed several handsome 
mansions, such as that of Mr. Gemmill the banker, 
and others, conducts the Traveller from Greenock 
to the united town of Port-Glasgow and Newark, 
situated by the river side upon a flat at the base of 
its woody hills, and which contains upw r ards of 6000 
inhabitants. It was erected into a parish in 1695, and 
has ever since been increasing in size, trade, popula¬ 
tion, and wealth. It is built upon a spot consisting 
of eleven acres, originally feued by the magistrates 
of Glasgow for the purpose of forming a harbour for 
the reception of their shipping, and is governed by 
two baillies and a council, consisting of eleven feuars, 
possessed of, at least, £10 sterling of yearly income, 
arising from heritable property. This council of 
thirteen trustees was appointed to regulate the police 
of the place, by an act of Parliament, in 1775, when 
the town was erected into a borough of barony with 
the consent of the immediate superiors, the city of 
Glasgow, and the proprietor of the lands of Finlay- 
ston-Maxwell. The harbour is capable of receiving 
the largest vessels, without discharging any part of 
their cargoes, which cannot be done at Greenock. 
Besides a considerable number of fine houses, there 
has lately been erected an elegant Town-house, with 
a fine spire which contains a clock. On the eastern 
point of the bay stand the ruins of Newark-castle, 
the property of Lord Belhaven, in whose family it

has remained for a considerable time. It is lofty 
and not destitute of magnificence, having consisted 
ot a square court, with high walls, round turrets, and 
battlements. Over the main door are the arms of the 
Maxw r ells of Finlayston, to whom it formerly be¬ 
longed, very much defaced, and having beneath them 
this inscription, 

THE BLESSING OF GOD BE HEREON, 

ANNO MDXCVII. 

The tower is a more ancient structure than the rest, 
but the date of its erection is unknown. The town 
is overlooked from the south by hills of considerable 
eminence, which are covered with woods, and bro¬ 
ken by deep ravines, through which flow streams of 
pure and wholesome water. From their summits, 
the ascent to which is picturesque and romantic, an 
extensive and charming prospect is obtained of the 
Clyde, the rock and castle of Dunbarton, Ben-Lo- 
mond, numerous gentlemen’s seats, and a thousand 
other objects which decorate a landscape and enchant 
the view. 

Leaving Port-Glasgow, the Traveller will go east¬ 
ward in a direction nearly parallel to the river, and 
about two miles distant he will pass Broad field, an 
elegant mansion, possessed by Mr. Crawford, and 
several other residences upon the side of the sloping 
hills. The principal of these is Finlayston, a seat of 
the former Earls of Glencairn, and now belonging 
to Mr. Graham of Gartmore. It is situated in the 
parish of Kilmalcom, where are still preserved the 
four Communion-cups used by John Knox in admi-

nistering the sacrament after the Presbyterian form. 
They are of silver, have a very venerable appearance, 
and are greatly respected both for their antiquity and 
the sacred use to which they have been applied dur¬ 
ing nearly three centuries. 

A short way beyond this is Bishopton, on the left, 
belonging to Sir John Maxwell of Pollok, command¬ 
ing a fine view of the Clyde and the mountainous 
country on its northern bank. Passing the Inn of 
Bishopton, the Tourist will travel through a fertile, 
well-cultivated district, adorned with numerous 
seats. North-Bar and Walkinshaw, belonging to 
Mr. Boyd Alexander, and South-Bar, possessed by 
Mr. Buchanan, are the most conspicuous. He will 
next cross the river formed by the confluence of the 
two Carts and the Greiff, by the Bridge of Inshin- 
nan. A beautiful bridge of uncommon structure 
was built here, in 1759; but, being undermined by 
the water, fell in the spring of 1809. A new one, 
of superior strength and elegance, was erected in 
1812 by Mr. Brocket, mason in Glasgow, at an ex¬ 
pense of £18,000. Beyond this is Renfrew, a place 
of considerable antiquity, and the county-town, giv¬ 
ing name to the shire. Robert II., who frequently 
resided here, in a palace upon the Castle-hill, on the 
banks of the Clyde, erected it into a sheriffdom, and 
afterwards into a royal borough. It is also distin¬ 
guished by having been the scene of the defeat of 
Summerled, thane of Argyle, in 1164, by Malcolm 
III., against whom that chieftain headed an army of 
predatory insurgents. Here, likewise, the Laird of 







Paisley.—Inscription on Abbey. 371 

Greenock, the contemptible minion of a faithless 
court, apprehended the good and gallant Marquis 
of Argyle, and carried him prisoner to Edinburgh, 
where he fell a sacrifice to the vile passions of those 
men who were oppressing Scotland, and persecuting 
the best of her sons. From this the traveller may 
proceed, by an excellent road of seven miles, to 
Glasgow; or, turning to the right, traverse the 
beautiful plain, upon the south of which is situated 
Paisley, a place of ancient name, and of great ma¬ 
nufacturing fame. 

Paisley is recognized as the Vanduaria, the Height 
of the Watery Flow, of Ptolemy the ancient geogra¬ 
pher. It is situated on both sides of the White 
Cart, over which are three good stone bridges. The 
principal street runs from east to west, and contains 
many handsome well-finished houses. A priory of 
Clugniensian monks was founded here, in 1164, by 
Walter the Steward of Scotland, which was after¬ 
wards raised to the rank of an abbey, when Robert 
II. erected the lands belonging to into a regality, 
under the jurisdiction of the abbot. These have 
long ago been secularized, and partly constitute the 
estate of the Earl of Abercorn. The place was made 
a burgh of barony by James IV. on the solicitation 
of George Shaw, then abbot of the monastery, as a 
rude inscription on the north-west corner of the gar¬ 
den-wall indicates. This is too curious to be omitted.

372 Public buildings.—Population and trade of Paisley. 

Among the principal buildings in Paisley are, the 
Old Abbey, the remains of which are still so entire 
as to demonstrate its former magnificence, and in 
which an elegant new church has been constructed 
since 1789; and the Earl of Abercorn’s cemetery, 
an old Gothic chapel, having the finest echo, per¬ 
haps, in the world, and in which is a monument to 
the memory of Marjory, daughter of King Robert 
Bruce, first, wife to Walter the Steward, and, after¬ 
wards, to Robert II. The other three churches are 
large, and handsomely finished; and the High 
Church, built in 175b, has a beautiful and lofty 
spire. The Town-house is a fine edifice with a 
steeple and clock, and contains a prison, court-hall, 
and other apartments, a part of which is let for an 
inn. The town contains upwards of 30,000 souls. 

Paisley has long been remarkable for the fine 
structure of its silks, muslins, gauze, ribbons, nuns’ 
thread, tanneries, soap and candle works, inkles, 
tapes, and the machinery and implements used in 
the fabrication of these different kinds of goods, the 
total annual value of which is calculated considera¬ 
bly to exceed £800,000 sterling. The trade and 
manufactures of the place derive advantage from the 
navigation of the Cart, which has been deepened so 
as to admit vessels, drawing seven feet of water, from 
the Clyde. The internal policy of the town is vested 
in a provost, three baillies and seventeen counsellors, 
elected annually in October. The prosperity of 
Paisley will be further promoted by the comple¬ 
tion of the Glasgow and Ardrossan Canal, passing 
through a tract of country abounding in coal, lime, 




Cardonnel.—Cruikstone-castle. 575 

and iron-stone, and enriched by an industrious po¬ 
pulation of nearly 150,000 souls. 

Taking leave of Paisley, the Traveller will follow 
the great road leading to Glasgow through a fine 
luxuriant country. He will soon after discover, on 
his right, Crossflatt the house of Mr. Brown, and on 
the left Greenlaw, and Newhall the seat of Mr. Kib¬ 
ble. On the same side is Beershaw situated on an 
eminence ; and on the right may be seen Auchin- 
torly, Blackhall, and Hawkhead, an elegant seat of 
the Earl of Glasgow, surrounded with an extensive 
pleasure-ground and thriving plantations. Proceed¬ 
ing eastward, he will pass, on the same hand, Rals¬ 
ton the property of Mr. Orr, and beyond this Car¬ 
donnel, an old family-seat overshadowed by some 
venerable trees, once belonging to a branch of the 
Darnleys, but now to Lord Blantyre. In the same 
direction, a view is obtained of the ivied ruins of 
Cruikston-castle, once a magnificent seat of the fa¬ 
mily of Lennox. Here stood the withered remains 
of the Yew-tree, sacred, of yore, to the connubial 
endearments of Henry Darnley and his beauteous 
Queen. Nearly a mile beyond the Half-way-house, 
on the right, is Dumbreck, built on the top of a hill. 
On the opposite side is Craigton, the beautiful resi¬ 
dence of Mr. Ritchie, and beyond that. Plantation, 
the highly ornamented seat of Mr. John Mair, who 
possesses a fine collection of paintings, including the 
principal pieces of the late Mr. Allan of Edinburgh,

sides of the road are many neat villas and houses be-

longing to the merchants and manufacturers of this 
city. Having passed these, the Touristwill enter 
Tradestown, and by the New Bridge arrive at Glas¬ 
gow, occupied by 120,000 inhabitants, where, in any 
of the commodious and elegant Inns, with which it 
abounds, he will meet with every accommodation, at¬ 
tention, and luxury, that a great city usually affords. 


One of the most celebrated pieces of scenery in 
the Lowlands of Scotland, now demands the Tour¬ 
ist’s attention. Let him, then, leave Glasgow and 
join his ff guide ” to the romantic 

dfalfe of the Clptfe. 

Proceeding, therefore, eastward from the city, and 
passing the villages of Camlachie and Tolcross, the 
first object of notice is the extensive iron manufac¬ 
tory of Outram &amp; Co., begun in 1786, by the river’s 
side upon the right. At Broomliouse-toll the Clydes¬ 
dale road branches off to the right, soon after crosses 
the North Calder river, and immediately falls in with 
the banks of the Clyde, along which it runs through 
a beautiful plain, till it arrives at the vicinity of the 
hamlet of Uddingston, situated upon an eminence 
commanding a delightful and varied prospect to¬ 
wards the west. Not far beyond this, is the village 
of Bothwell, in the neighbourhood of which are the 
ancient and modem castles of that name, both the 
property of Lord Douglas. The old castle occupies 
a charming situation upon an elevated bank of the 


I 







river, which here makes a noble sweep. The beauty 
of its site, and the gloomy grandeur of its ruins, at¬ 
tracted the sweetly pathetic muse of the late Mr. 
John Finlay, * who thus describes it: 

“ Thou hoary warrior! bent with years 
And swiftly mould’ring to decay. 

Faint-gleaming on my raptur’d sight. 

While through the Vale of Clyde I stray. 

And view from far the rocky steep 
T he moon with mellow ray adorning. 

Pouring her beams o’er hill and vale. 

Far sweeter than the smiles of morning! 

Behold! she flings her lustre wide ‘ 

And calms the brownness of the wood! 

Where tow’ring high in stately pride. 

Thy walls frown awful o’er the flood. 

Thy walls, from ancient grandeur chang’d. 

How sullen o’er the wave impending! 

And with the ivy’s mantling green. 

Their hoary moss-grown fragments blending.”— 

Bothwell-castle is a noble monument of antiquity, 
and is indeed one of the most magnificent ruins in 
Scotland. The structure itself is superb, and all the 
neighbouring objects have an aspect of grandeur. 
The Clyde takes a fine sweep round the castle, where 


* This harmonious and accomplished poet was a native of Glasgow, in the 
University of which city he was educated. His attainments in literature 
were of considerabie eminence, and adorned by the polished elegance of a 
chaste and refined taste. In 1802, he published his “Wallace, or the Vale 
of Ellerslie,” a sweet poem, distinguished in a great degree by fine sentiment 
conveyed in a diction, at once simple, melodious, spirited, and pure. The 
merit of this work being generally acknowledged, a second edition was soon 
required, and which he greatly enlarged. Attached to it, is a selection of 
shorter pieces, finished in the same genuine spirit of ease, pathos,and energy. 
He also edited a collection of Ancient Ballads, accompanied with very inge¬ 
nious illustrative notes. While engaged in the execution of a new original 
work, of which the highest expectations were formed, he died, December 
1810, in the twenty-eighth year of his age, at Moffat, on his way to England, 
whither he was going for the benefit of his health.

its breadth is considerable, and its stream spreads 
over a flat rocky bottom. Its banks on both sides 
are very lofty, romantic, and adorned with natural 
wood. On the southern side is the Craig of Blan¬ 
tyre, with an ecclesiastical ruin upon the brink of 
the perpendicular rock; while, on the northern bank 
of the Clyde, stands the castle of Both well, with a 
bold aspect towards the south, and rearing, at both 
ends, its lofty towers. 

The whole work is executed with polished stone 
of a red colour, and the roofs of the apartments are 
very lofty. What of it remains occupies a space, in 
length 234 feet, and in breadth 99 feet, over the 
walls. The lodgings were confined to the east and 
west ends, and many of them are sufficiently distin¬ 
guished. The chapel is marked with a number of 
small windows, and has a chamber of state oft' with 
it, with two large windows to the south. An old 
well in the corner of one of the towers, penetrating 
through the rock to a good spring, was discovered 
a few years ago. The stair of one of the highest 
towers is almost entire to the top, which presents 
an immense height above the river. The court in 
the middle was probably designed to contain the 
cattle and provisions in case of an assault; an ar¬ 
rangement peculiar to many ancient castles. The 
entry is on the north, about the middle of the wall: 
vestiges of the fosse are yet visible. It appears to have 
been built and enlarged at different times, and by 
the several proprietors who occupied it; but, after 
having been in the possession of different families.

it has again returned to the noble house of Douglas. 
The Priory of Blantyre, opposite, was founded in 
the thirteenth century ; and a prior of this monastery 
was one of the Scottish commissioners appointed to 
negotiate the ransom of King David Bruce, taken 
prisoner at the battle of Durham in 1346. Thus 
upon this spot, to whatever point we turn, and 
whether we consider the majestic ruins around us, 
or the singular variety of changes in their history, 
which have occurred during the lapse of ages, few 
places will be found affording such awful monuments 
of the devastations produced by time.

COWPER. 


Bothwell-church is an old structure in the Gothic 
style, seventy f^et in length over the walls, and 
thirty-nine in breadth. It is covered with large 
polished stones laid over an arched roof. The whole 
edifice is composed of stone, strengthened by pilas¬ 
ters, to support the weight of the roof. The date 
of its construction is not known; but the Douglas 
arms are upon one of the windows quartered with 
the royal, probably alluding to the marriage of the 
Earl of Douglas with the heiress of Bothwell, who 
was grand-daughter of Robert Bruce. 

The short distance from this of two miles, which

578 Town of Hamilton. 

is finely diversified, conducts the Traveller to the 
ancient town of Hamilton, situated in a beautiful, 
populous, and highly cultivated country, washed 
by the Clyde and the Avon, two delightful streams. 
It stands in a low situation upon the Clyde, skirting 
around the bottom of a rising ground of about three 
quarters of a mile in length. It is a considerable 
thoroughfare, as the roads from Glasgow towards 
England, and from Edinburgh to Ayrshire, pass 
through it. In the middle there is a prison and 
town-house, built in 1643. The parish-church 
stands above the town upon a rising ground. It 
was designed by the elder Adam, and makes a good 
appearance. 

It is difficult to determine at what time this town 
was built, but it now contains nearly 7000 inhabi¬ 
tants. It originally stood lower down, clustering 
around the duke’s house, or palace as it is some¬ 
times called; but these buildings having been pur¬ 
chased and pulled down, the town has since stretched 
upwards to the south and west, leaving the palace 
detached below it. One house still standing has the 
date 1533 cut over the gateway ; and part of some 
others are still to be seen older. Hamilton-house, 
which stands on the level valley between the town 
and the river Clyde, is a large pile, but of a dull and 
disagreeable aspect, having two deep wings at right 
angles with the centre. The collection of paintings 
which it contains is extremely valuable, and has 
always attracted the attention of travellers. A por¬ 
trait of James the First of England and Sixth of 




Hamilton Palace and Paintings.

Scotland, by Cornelius Janson, and one of Charles 
the First on horseback by Vandyke, together with a 
series of family pictures by Vandyke, My tens, Knel- 
ler, Lely, Hamilton, and Reynolds, form a very su¬ 
perb collection of portraits. The miscellaneous part 
of the old collection has been greatly enriched, or 
rather entirely eclipsed, in consequence of the addi¬ 
tions made by the present duke, whose elegant taste 
and partiality for the fine arts, previously to his 
accession to the dignity, had induced him to form 
a very extensive collection of the works of an¬ 
cient masters. The greatest part of these have been 
removed from his seat of Ashton-hall, Lancashire, to 
the palace of Hamilton. Among these, two pictures 
of the Holy Burial or Entombing of Christ, the one 
by Poersin, the other by Titian, are calculated to 
exhibit by what different styles great artists produce 
similar effects. A large Cattle-Piece, by Giacomo 
Bassano, is highly valued, as are the specimens of 
Andrea dell Sarto. The stories of St. Sebastian and 
Cain and Abel are large pictures by Guido, in a 
grand style. A Holy Family by fl Frari, a St. John 
by Guercino, the Marriage of Jacob and Laban by 
Peter de Tortona, and Madonas by Sassaferats, are 
beautiful pictures, as also is the Village Lawyer by 
Holbein. Two Misers by Q. Matsey, and a Conver¬ 
sation-Piece by Bronar, are universally admired. A 
particular and discriminating account of this noble 
collection would be a difficult task, and extend to 
a length unsuitable to the present purpose. But 
though detail must be avoided, it would be unpar-

donable to pass over two pictures that might be pro¬ 
minent in any collection, and which bestow a supe¬ 
rior splendour upon this. These are, Daniel in the 
Den of Lions by Rubens, and Earl Denbigh going 
a-shooting by Vandyke. These magnificent pictures 
have been commented on by the Tourists, and never 
failed to command the highest approbation. In the 
first, the situation of the prophet, amid a group of 
such ferocious animals, some of which are subdued 
into tameness, and others are bridled in the midst of 
their rage, is adequately conceived and forcibly ex¬ 
pressed. The uplifted eyes, and the clasped hands 
and elevated arms of Daniel, exhibit strong feelings, 
which have additional energy from his limbs being 
folded one over the other, and indicate the recent 
state of thoughtfulness and melancholy from which 
he has awaked to a burst of piety and gratitude. 

The second of the principal paintings, mentioned 
as forming the most distinguished in this grand col¬ 
lection, is a portrait of Viscount Fielding, first Earl 
of Denbigh, whose eldest daughter was married to 
the Marquis, afterwards Duke of Hamilton. In this 
picture the painter has combined all the energies of 
imagination with the reality of portrait. The earl 
is represented in a loose dress going out a-shooting. 
The scene is removed to a tropical climate, and cha¬ 
racterised by the palm-tree and perroket, and he is 
attended by a Morisco boy, who is in the act of whis¬ 
pering and pointing out the game, while the Earl is 
exhibited in the moment of turning round to discover 
it. The action is animated, the air of the head is

graceful, and the countenance open and expressive, 
exciting amazement that the power of colours can 
express life so strongly. Indeed, so dignified and 
energetic is the expression of the head, that it is 
sometimes regretted he were not surrounded by a 
senate or followed by an army. 

Having seen whatever is remarkable about Hamil¬ 
ton, the Traveller will take what is called the Carlisle 
road, and this will soon bring him to the river Avon, 
over which is a bridge, whose erection is ascribed 
by tradition to the splenetic disapppointment of an 
opulent priest. Here, by a gate, is the entrance to 
Chatelherault, a summer residence of the family of 
Hamilton, situated on a rising ground. It is built 
in the French style, and is an imitation of the castle 
of the same name in France, of which the former 
dukes were proprietors, and from which they derived 
a title. It stands on the banks of the Avon, which 
are here very steep and romantic. On the opposite 
side of this stream are the ruins of Cadzow-castle, 
anciently the residence of the same noble family. 
During the reign of Queen Mary, it was plundered 
and partly demolished by the myrmidons of the re¬ 
gent Murray, after his success at the battle of Lang- 
side. Since that time it has continued in a state of 
desolation and ruin. A little below this, and on the 
same side of the river, stand the remains of Barn¬ 
cluith, formerly a villa built in the Dutch style, by 
one of the Hamiltons of Pencaitland. The site of it 
is charming, and surrounded with many beauties 
both natural and ornamental. 





o82 Mauldslie-castle—Stonebyres Fall. 

About a mile beyond Avon bridge the Tourist 
will leave the Carlisle road, and turning to the left 
enter Clydesdale, a delightful valley, adorned with 
many noble mansions. Among these Mauldslie-cas¬ 
tle arrests the attention, both on account of its fine 
situation on the north bank of the Clyde, and the 
beauty of its architecture. It is a modern building 
in the form of a castle, consisting of various orders, 
the design of the late Mr. R. Adam. A short way 
beyond the village of Dalserf, a bridge conducts 
across the Nethan, a pretty streamlet flowing through 
a very romantic glen, in which, upon a lofty promon¬ 
tory, stand the ruins of Draffin or Craignethan-castle, 
anciently a seat of the family of Hamilton, but now 
the property of Lord Douglas. In this fortress the 
hapless Mary found a short respite, after her escape 
from the persecution of those who had detained her 
in Loch-Leven-castle. 

Proceeding a few miles farther, the Journeyer will 
enter the wood of Stonebyres, when his ear will be 
struck by a hollow murmuring noise, increasing as 
he advances. On emerging from the wood, he will 
observe a board pointing out the way to 

STONEBYRES FALL. 

Descending a steep hill, for about two hundred pa¬ 
ces, he will come to a precipitous bank of the river, 
where, from a chair placed there by the late Mr. 
David Dale, he may contemplate, in security, the 
grand and awful scene beneath him. The fall con¬ 
sists of three breaks, but when the river is swollen it

dashes down in one unbroken sheet, above eighty 
feet in height; it is the ne plus ultra of the salmon, 
as none can possibly get above it, although their 
endeavours, in the spawning season, are incessant 
and amusing. Above, the river is smooth and tran¬ 
quil, but being here contracted, forces itself with 
inconceivable fury over the shelving rocks. The 
accompanying scenery is very fine, and the immense 
quantity of water, thus tumbling headlong down, 
produces a most sublime effect. From the lowest 
fall, the spray rises high into the atmosphere, and 
gives an indistinctness to the scene, that greatly in¬ 
creases its sublimity and grandeur. 

Having surveyed, at his leisure, this most inter¬ 
esting spot, the Tourist may proceed on his road, 
which will soon bring him opposite to the mouth of 
the river Mouss, falling into the Clyde a mile below 
the town of Lanark. This stream flows through a 
very romantic dell, bounded on either side by a reef 
of lofty, precipitous, rugged rocks, denominated 
Cartlan-Craigs. These are fringed with coppice- 
wood and young plantations on the south. The 
northern bank is about 400 feet in height, and both 
are finely varied with the different appearances of 
naked cliffs and silvan precipices. In the bottom, 
the Mouss guides its lonely course amid prominent 
cliffs, inaccessible caverns, and pathless wilds, dark¬ 
ened by foliage and beautified by mountain-flowers. 
One of these dreary caverns has attracted notice 
by being connected with the name of the patriot 
Wallace. Baronald-house, the seat of Mr. Lockhart,

is situated on the banks of this streamlet in a fine 
woody hollow, having the Cartlan-Craigs as a screen 
from the northern blast. A little above the house, 
on the south, is a singular echo, the reverberations 
of which are distinct and loud. At a short distance 
from this is the thriving town of Lanark, 656 feet 
above the level of the sea. 

This is one of the most ancient towns in Scotland, 
mistakingly supposed by some antiquaries to occupy 
the site of Colania, a Roman station, which was at 
Little-Clyde, twenty-four miles to the south-east. It 
was erected into a royal borough by Alexander I., 
whose charter, with those of Robert I. and James V., 
was confirmed, in 1632, by Charles I. It is classed 
with Linlithgow, Selkirk, and Peebles, in sending a 
member to Parliament. The electors are the Common 
Council and Deacons of Crafts, consisting of a pro¬ 
vost, dean of guild, and thirteen counsellors. The 
population of Old and New Lanark amounts to nearly 
6000 ; and in the town are a church, town-house, 
grammar-school, and a very good inn, which is much 
frequented in summer by strangers who come to visit 
the Falls of Clyde. In this house is kept a book, 
wherein travellers may insert observations on the sce¬ 
nery they have been visiting. Among many others 
equally apposite, will be seen the following half-witty 
hobbling impromptu:

It comes roaring and grumbling, 

And leaping and tumbling, 

And hopping and skipping.

And bubbling and boiling; 

And beating and jumping. 

And bellowing and thumping.

But the trunks are tied on 
And I must be gone. 

About a mile and a half beyond the town stands 
New Lanark, a pleasant village, chiefly occupied by 
those engaged in the extensive cotton-mills, erected 
in 1785, under the auspices of the late enterprising 
and benevolent Mr. David Dale, but now the pro¬ 
perty of Messrs. Owen &amp; Co., who employ about 
1500 people. The mills, which are four in number, 
and of a handsome lofty structure, are situated at the 
western extremity of the Bonniton-grounds, in a low 
silvan dell, and within view of Dundaff Linn, a 
pretty romantic fall, of about four feet in height. 
In this vicinity is a picturesque rock, which tradition 
exults to point out as the Chair of Wallace, in 
which the patriot is said to have concealed himself 
from the inveterate enmity of the faithless foes of his 
country. From this the road is continued quite close 
to the stupendous banks of the river, and soon enters 
the grounds of Bonniton, when a short turn to the 
right enables the Traveller to obtain the first view 
of the

from which it is seen to great advantage, while the 
astonished senses partake of the turbulence of the 
roaring waters.

JVilson’s Clyde. 

After having recovered his recollection, suspended 
at first by the terrific view, the spectator will con¬ 
template, with a complacency mingled with awe, the 
picture before him, equally tremendous and sublime. 
The banks of the river on either side are lofty, craggy, 
and covered with woods. A ruinous castle seated on 
a giddy pinnacle, a corn-mill clanking upon the rock 
below, the wild-birds screaming on the wing, and the 
tumultuous water struggling in its abyssinous pool, 
together with the accompanying scenery of crags, 
and chasms, and steeps, and trees, and brakes, and 
bushes, combine in a grotesque association, at once 
terrific and pleasing. A pavilion, erected by Sir 
James Carmichael of Bonniton, in 1708, overlooks 
the fall. In the uppermost room is placed a mirror, 
in which the torrent appears to dash its sweepy flood 
over the head of the astonished beholder. From this 
is obtained a fine bird’s-eye view of the cataract, and 
a prospect of the cotton-mills, the picturesque vil-

evanescent beauties of its ever-flitting shades. 

The channel of the Clyde above the Corra Linn is 
bounded by high rocks, wooded to their summits; 
and, between them, the river flows with great im¬ 
petuosity along a rugged bed. A short walk, three 
quarters of a mile above, leads to the 

FALL OF BONNITON, 

the impression of which will be lessened by the 
previous contemplation of grander scenes. From a 
rock overhanging the stream, and on which a turret 
has been built, is a good, though distant, view of the 
fall. This is only upwards of twelve feet in height, 
but is very beautiful, shooting in a broad unbroken 
sheet into a hollow glen, whence some of the water 
recoils in foam and spray. Above it the river is 
pure, expanded, and tranquil, beautifully margined 
by verdant slopes and overshadowed with lofty trees. 
Thus, in the distance of a few miles, the descent of 
the Clyde is at least 180 feet, from Bonniton to Stone- 
byres, including the little cascade of Dundaff Linn. 

On his return to Lanark, the enchanted Tourist 
may review, with more pleasurable emotions, the 
stupendous exhibitions which lately filled him with 
amazement and terror; and, while wrapt in a vision¬ 
ary recapitulation of each portentous scene, taking

Conclusion of the Tour. 


the road through Carnwath, Crosswood-burn, Currie, 
Collington, and Slateford, will be agreeably surprised 
to find himself in Edinburgh, and be happy while he 

“ Meets at each step a friend’s familiar face. 

And flies at last to Helen’s long embrace ; 

Wipes from her cheek the rapture-speaking tear. 

And clasps, with many a sigh, his children dear; 

While, long neglected, but at length, caress’d. 

His faitliful dog salutes the smiling guest. 

Points to his master’s eyes, (where’er they roam) 

His wistful face, and whines a welcome Home.”
