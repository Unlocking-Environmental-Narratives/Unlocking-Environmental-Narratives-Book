PEEFACE. 



This work is a compilation from the larger Guide book 
to this district of Scotland. The description of the 
three great Highland routes from the head of Loch 
Lomond, not belonging properly to this central portion 
of the coimtry, is omitted in this cheap edition, although 
the Itineraries which contain the most important in- 
formation for Tourists are still continued. The 
principal difference, however, between this and the 
larger work, is its want of Mr. Foster's illustrations, 
which, while they tend not only to embellish the text, 
and form excellent mementos of the scenery, are by 
some considered unnecessary. By relinquishing these, 
and leaving out or curtailing notes of minor importance, 
the expense of printing is very much diminished, and 
ihe publishers are enabled to offer this work at a price 
which it is thought will be sufficiently low to suit every 
description of readers. 

The plan of noting the distances and inns is that 
adopted by Mr. Murray in his Continental Handbooks. 



IV PREFACE. 

An Itinerary precedes each tour, while the distances in 
miles from the starting point are placed in brackets — 
80 (8) — throughout each separate route; thus enabling 
the tourist to see at a glance how far he has gone, or 
the length of the journey still before him, and more ac- 
curately in his progress to determine the exact localities 
described.

TRAVELLING EXPENSES. 



The expense necessarily attendant upon travelling must be ad- 
mitted to be a considerable drawoack from its pleasures. Still 
the evil is inevitable ; and it may be satisfactory to tourists to be 
able to 'estimate the price to be paid for their enjoyment. 

The following scale shows the average charge for the several 
items which enter into the traveller's bill. The prices in the Jlrst 
division of the scale are rarely exceeded in any of the Inns in the 
smaller towns in Scotland ; while in some villages, charges even 
more moderate may sometimes be met with. The prices in the 
second division show the charges in Hotels of the highest class in 
Edinbxu-gh. 



Breakfast, Is. 6cl. to 2s. 
Dinner, 2s. to .33. 
Tea, l3. 6d. to 2s. 
Supper, Is. 6d. to 28. 

Port or Sherry, per bottle, ds 

Porter or Ale, per bottle, 6d. to Is. .. 

Branay, per gill. Is. 6d 

Wliisky, per gill, 9d 

Bed, Is. 6d. to 33 

•«* If the Traveller require his table to be furnished beyond the 
ordinary scale of comfort, he must be prepared for a proportionate 
increase of charge. 



2s. to 3s. 

3s. to 48. 

2s. to 38. 

According to what is ordered. 

6s. 

Is. 

2s. 

Is. 

Ss. 6d. to 4s. 



In the inferior coimtry Inns, Wine, Brandy, and Malt Liquor 
are frequently not to be met with, or, if kept, will probably be of 
indifferent quality. 

Posting, Is. 6d. per mile ; postboy, 3d. per mile. 

A one-horse four-wheeled carriage, Is. per mile, or 15s. per day 

A gig, 10s. 6d. to 12s. per day. 

A riding-horse, 6s. or 7s. ; a pony, 5s. per day. 

*«* In large towns the charges for carriages and riding-horses are 
about 20 per cent above those here quoted. Where the hire is 
for several successive days, an abatement may be expected. 
Tlie posting is the same in town and country. 

The payment of the gratuities to servants at Inns is a soiurce 



VI NOTE ON TKAVELLING EXPENSES. 

of great annoyance to travellers. It would very largely contri- 
bute to the tourist's comfort were the chai-ges under this head 
included among the other items of the landlord's bill. Although 
this practice has been adopted by a few Hotel-keepers in other 
parts ot the kingdom, it is believed that it has not j'et been intro- 
duced into any of the Inns in Scotland. 

To enable them to furnish tourists with some information on 
this subject, tlie publishers have applied to two Hotel-keepers of 
the first respectability (the one in Dublin, the other in Liverpool) 
hy whom the practice of charging for servants is adopted, and the 
following ar^ averaged from the rates charged in their establish- 
ments: — 

unv 1. 

\ '. A single gentleman, taking tlie j^eneral accoramodation of the Hotel for 
one or two meals as a passing traveller, Waiter, 6d ; Chambermaid, 
6d ; Porter or Boots, 6d. Tliis includes the removiJ of auy reason- 
able weiKht of luggage ; but extra messages and parciils are charged 
separately. 

2. 

A single gentleman, staying a day and night, and taking his meals in the 
hotel, Is. 6d. or 2s. for servants, and if lie stays several days, Is. or Is. 
6d. per day. 

3. 
A gentleman and his wife, occupying a sitting-room and bedroom, 2$. 
6d. to 38. 6d. per night for servants. If accompanied by sons or 
daughters, or otner relatives, half this rate from each ; but no charge

We take the liberty of supposing that the tourist has 
found his way to Stirling, now accessible from all parts 
of Scotland by the Scottish Central Railway and by 
the steamers on the Forth. Its remarkable resem- 
blance in general outline to Edinburgh immediately 
strikes the stranger who may have just left the capital 
of Scotland. Stirling is, indeed, a very perfect relic of 
the manner in which the Scots of old built their towns 
when they found groimd of a suitable character. On a 
rock, precipitous on one side, they would raise the

acropolis or castle, building the town in one sloping 
street dowTiwards, so as to be under its protection. 
Though it boasts of a few suburban villas and neat rows 
of modem houses, Stirling has not been so much en- 
larged or changed as materially to alter its character 
as an ancient town. On either side of the steep as- 
cending main street, the fronts of ancient houses still 
show the turrets, crow-stepped gables, or quaint deco- 
rations of the old street architecture of Scotland. It 
was the fashion of old for the neighboimng nobles 
and gentry to have their city mansions in such a town 
as Stirling. Such was the destined use of many of 
the buildings now devoted to humbler occupants, and 
-hence they have acquired their handsome decorated 
character. 

ARGYLE's LODGING, BROAD STREET, 

The most conspicuous of these hotels, stands on the 
East side of the Castle Wynd, and is now used as a 
military hospital in connection with the Castle. With 
its pinnacled round towers and finely decorated windows, 
it is an excellent specimen of the French castellated 
architecture so much used in Scotland. It has had 
an interesting historj'. It belonged to the accomplished 
poet, Sir William Alexander, who, in the reign of 
Charles I., was made Earl of Stirling* (1632), and 
who got a grant of the vast territory of Nova Scotia, 

* The Earl of Stirling's paternal estate of Menstrie will be 
seen on the way to the scenery of the Devon. He was one of 
those men who, to literary habits, add a keen relish for the pur- 
suits of active life. He was the originator of the project for the 
colonization of Nova Scotia, and had the entire management of 
the scheme. He was the author of several volumes of poetry, 
which at one time obtained considerable praise, Lithgow styling 
him " true Castalian fire ;" Drayton, " my Alexander ;" and King 
James, "my philosophical poet." Indeed, so great a favourite

to be partitioned off in baronetcies. It afterwards (1 640) 
fell into the hands of the Argyle family, who removed 
from it the arms of the Stirling family, and substituted 
their own ; and here the Duke of York, afterwards 
King James II. of England, enjoyed the hospitality of 
the Earl of Argyle, who probably did not predict that 
his royal guest was on an early occasion to cut off his 
head. Here the Duke of Argyle had his head-quarters 
during the Rebellion of 1715. Opposite Argyle's

mar's work. 

The remains of the house built by the Earl of Mar, 
stand at the head of Broad Street. In the centre are 
the Royal Arms of Scotland, and on the projecting 
towers on each side, those of the Regent Mar and his 
Countess. Its architecture is richly decorated, par- 
taking of the ecclesiastical character. Tradition indeed 
says that it was built of stones taken from the ruins 
of Cambuskenneth, and that for this sacrilege its 
founder was cut off before it was finished. He was 
engaged in deeper and more substantial crimes, how- 
ever, than the selfish use of the consecrated stones, 
for he was laying his plots, with Cecil and Morton, for 
the assassination of Queen Mary, when death suddenly 
overtook him at Stirling in the year 1572, probably when 

was he with the pedantic monarch, whose learning, doubtless, was 
not seldom the theme of his skilful flattery, that he obtained large 
grants of land and lordships both in North America and Scotland, 
as well as the privilege of coining for the latter country a species 
of base copper money called turners. It is said that when ho.

he was overlooking the progress of his building. Some 
curious inscriptions on the remains look like a defiance 
of the world by one who was uneasy under its obser- 
vation, thus — 

The moir I stand in oppin hitht, 
Mi faults moir subject ar to sitht ; 
I pray all luikers on this luging, 
AVith gentle e to gif thair juging.

Consider weil and care noch. 

It seems odd to our habits in the present day, to 
find an important statesman — the governor of a king- 
dom — thus scribbling doggerel rhymes over his house to 
attract public attention. 

The edifice, by its appearance, confirms the tradition 
that it was never finished, for it will be seen to be in 
good preservation so far as it goes. The ecclesiastical 
features in the sculpture will also be readily recognised, 
and the architect appears to have very ingeniously 
adapted the gargoils, niches, and mullions of the abbey 
to the purposes of baronial decoration. Some of the 
sculptures are very curious — one, which almost re- 
sembles a bundle of rods made up like the Roman 
fasces, is supposed to have been intended for the babe 
in swaddling bands, and is doubtless very ancient. 

THE GREYFRIARS' OR FRANCISCAN CHURCH 

Stands on the declivity of the rock, and forms part of 
the general cluster of the Castle buildings. It was 
erected in 1494 by James IV.; and some additions were 
made to the eastern portion of it by Cardinal Beaton, 
whose body is mterred there. It will be found on exami- 
nation to be a fine specimen of the later pointed Gothic. 
To the English ecclesiologist it will be curious, as a 
type of architecture peculiar to Scotland. Though

dating from about the beginning of the sixteenth cen- 
tury, and thus contemporary with the depressed or 
perpendicular style of architecture in England, to the 
English antiquary it might thus appear a century older 
than it is. He will find it a peculiarity often met 
with in Scotland, where the later forms of English 
Gothic architecture never were adopted. The Scots, 
in fact, preferred the taste of their friends in France to 
that of their enemies in England. In this church the 
Earl of Arran, regent of the kingdom, abjured Roman- 
ism in 1543. It was also the scene of the coronation 
of James VI. on the 29th of July 1597, when John 
Knox preached the coronation sermon. Since the 
Reformation it has been divided into two places of 
worship, called the East and West Churches. The 
celebrated Ebenezer Erskine, founder of the Secession 
Church, was one of the ministers of the latter. 

WALK ROUND THE CASTLE. 

Ascending to the esplanade in front of the Castle, 
an exit will be seen to the left, leading to a pathway 
under the immediate rock, but overtopping the tree- 
covered bank on the south, and passing entirely round 
the Castle, over the more bare and broomy descent 
to the north and west. Part of it is called Edmon- 
stone's Road, and a seat and inscription commemorate 
the kind services of the gentleman bearing that name, 
by whom it was commenced. 

The firet remarkable point to which the path leads is 

THE ladies' ROCK, 

So called as the spot whence the ladies of the court 
looked down on the tournaments or less knightly sports 
pursued on the flat meadow ground below. It is inte- 
resting to look down from it and see still so fresh and

distinct the turf embankments for the sports. In the 
(.■entre is an octagonal / mound, where doubtless was 
raised the banner of the judge of merit in the con- 
tentions. Surrounding it is an octagonal bank, and, 
making a still wider circle, an embanked parallelogram 
— all seen from the rock as distinctly as if it were a 
ground-plan of an ornamental garden ; hence called the 
King's Park and King's Gardens. It was of this now 
deserted spot that we read — 

Now, in the Castle-park, drew ont 
Their chequer'd bands the jo);ous rout. 
There morricers, with bell at heel. 
And blade in hand, their mazes wheel ; 
But chief, beside the butts, there stand 
Bold Robin Hood and ail his band, — 
Friar Tuck with quarterstaff and cowl, 
Old Scathelocke with his surly scowl, 
Maid Marion, fair as ivory bone, 
Scarlet, and Mutch, and Little John ; 
Their bugles challenge all that will, 
In archery to prove their skill. 

The stranger's curiosity will probably tempt him 
to enter a narrow entrance to the left of Edmonstone's 
path, connected with a quaint building surmounted by 
a turret steeple. He finds himself in front of 

cowan's hospital, 

And right in the presence of the statue of its wor- 
shipful founder, who, cap in hand, looks down from 
his elevation with a courtly and majestic dignity. The 
Hospital was founded in 1639 by John Cowan, for de- 
cayed Guild brethren, or privileged city tradesmen. It 
possesses a very curious Dutch garden, still trimmed in 
the old style, with its multiform clipped yew trees and 
stone terrace, and has lately received an accession in a 
finely stained window. 



STIRLING — THE CASTLE. 



THE CASTLE. 



We now suppose that the tourist, crossing the 
drawbridge, enters the Castle by its low-browed arch- 
way. The buildings grouped immediately before him 
are extremely remarkable. 

THE PALACE. 

This profusely-ornamented edifice which, in the form 
of a quadrangle, occupies the south-east part of the 
fortress, was built by James V., who was crowned here. 
It at once rivets attention, and whoever wishes to 
examine the peculiarities of the north side as well as 
the front, may do so by entering a narrow doorway 
and ascending a small stair on the left. There seem 
two antagonist systems at work in this remarkable 
building, the one producing an effect of eminent rich- 
ness and grace when seen from afar, the other render- 
ing the very elements of these beauties, when looked 
at close at hand, gi'otesque, deformed, and horrible. 
It is extremely rare to find the architectural incrus- 
tations on a building productive of so much influence 
on its general outline. They are very efiective, not 
only from the foot of the rock, but at a considerable 
distance from it. This arises from large and bold pro- 
portions which are more curious than beautiful when 
seen close at hand. The statuary, which produces a 
sweet and graceful effect in the distant view, is found 
to embody all kinds of horrors on a close examination. 
Horrible commixtures of human and brute life — idiotic 
expressions of face — painful contortions of body, are all 
clustered in reckless playfulness. The wildest and 
least-becoming of the classical legends are here em- 
bodied without any attempts to realise classic beauty of 
form. Some of the group are arranged into corbels or

brackets for the support of the superincumbent archi- 
tecture, and here the sculptor has given to his super- 
human figures an appearance of superhuman labour 
and protracted agonising exertion, such as reminds one 
of a Sisyphus or Ixion undergoing the eternal punish- 
ment of the avenging gods. The whole mass of 
sculpture is apt to arouse reminiscences of some dread- 
ful nightmare ; and one whose imagination is apt to 
recall horrid or displeasing ideas need not dwell too 
long on it. How curious that, through the gracefiil 
architecture of the day, so dire a taste, or rather such 
utter desolation of taste, should have reigned in archi- 
tecture's great coadjutor, sculpture ; yet this reminds 
one that Stirling boasted of remarkable productions in 
this department of art. Has the tourist heard of " the 
Stirling Heads?" They belonged to an apartment 
■within the quadrangle of the Castle usually called 
" The King's Room," or " the presence." It had an 
oaken ceiling, such as can scarcely have known a rival 
in Europe, for it was divided into many partitions by 
richly decorated beams, and in each partition was a 
magnificently carved head. These heads are to be now 
seen only dispersed in the houses of some favoured or 
foi-tunate men of taste. We are not aware that one of 
them remains in Stirling. They were removed in the 
year 1777, when the roof of the apartment threatened, 
from their weight, to fall in. 

THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 

Erected by James III., occupies the east side of the 
upper square. It has been more meddled with and 
modernized than the Palace, and its original character 
is chiefly preserved in a few thin decorations. The hall 
where the parliaments were held was 120 feet long. 



STIRLING CASTLE THE ARMOURY. 9 

THE ARMOURY, 

Fonnerly the Chapel-Royal, stands on the north side 
of the upper square. It was built in 1594 by James 
VI. on the demolition of St. Michael's Chapel, for the 
baptism of his son Henry. 

Entering the narrow doorway in front of the palace, 
a way is found through a long vaulted passage to the 
western parapet. On the right hand are seen the doors 
of dungeons, occupied by state prisoners so lately as the 
year 1820, when a slight skirmish took place at Bonny- 
muir, in the neighbouring parish of Cumbernauld, 
between the military and a few insurgents, chiefly 
discontented Glasgow weavers. 

Underneath the exterior wall, on the west, a 
narrow road leads from the town, and descends the 
precipice behind the Castle. This is called 

ballangeich, 

A Gaelic word signif\ang " windy pass," which is 
remarkable as having furnished the fictitious name 
adopted by James V. in the various disguises which he 
was in the habit of assuming, for the purpose, it was 
said, of seeing that justice was regularly administered, 
and frequently also from the less justifiable motive of 
gallantry. To the north of the Castle is a small mount 
called 

THE MOLEHILL, 

Surrounded by small terraces, which has probably made 
it traditionally be counted an ancient court of justice. 
In later times it was used as a place of execution. 

Thou, sad and fatal mound, 

That oft hast heard the death-axe sound. 

On this eminence, and within sight of their Castle

of Doune and their extensive possessions, Murdoch 
Duke of Albany, Duncan Earl of Lennox, his father- 
in-law, and his two sons, Walter and Alexander 
Stuart, were beheaded by James I. in 1424. The exe- 
cution of Walter Stuart is supposed, with great proba- 
bility, to be the groundwork of the beautiful pathetic 
ballad of "Young Waters." This "heading hill" 
now commonly bears the name of Hurley- Hacket, from 
its being the scene of an amusement practised by 
James V. when a boy, and his courtiers, which con- 
sisted in sliding in some sort of chair from top to 
bottom of the bank. At present the Molehill forms a 
portion of the public walk round the Castle. 

Stirling Castle is one of the four fortresses of Scot- 
land, which, by the articles of the Union, are always 
to be kept in repair. It is now used as a barrack. 
As a fortification, it will be seen that Stirling Castle 
is now a place of little moment. Though Scott de- 
scribes very picturesquely the effect of a cannon ball 
sent from its ramparts against the party of the rebels 
conducting Waverley to Edinburgh ; yet it is believed 
that a discharge from guns of any considerable calibre 
would shake down the old walls, and save an enemy the 
trouble of demolishing them. In its day, however, 
" Grey Stirling, Bulwark of the North," effectually held 
the tete du pont between the Highlands and the lowlands. 
It was an old saying that " The Forth bridles the wild 
Highlander ; " and when there was a party stationed at 
the Ford of Frew, near Aberfoyle, the passage from the 
mountain districts to the lowlands was completely closed, 
unless to those following circuitous routes above the 
sources of the river. It will be observed that no part 
of the craggy hill is fortified save the little rocky crest 
which so beautifully surmounts the whole ; but were 
a fortification actually needed to stop the communica-

tion between the north and south, it is believed that 
the castle hill would be available for very extensive 
works. 

HISTOBICAL ASSOCIATIONS. 

Supposing the tourist to be contemplating the 
matchless view from the ramparts, let iis rapidly lay 
before him the chief associations connected with what 
is under and around him. Truly on no other spot 
upon the earth does one stand in the middle of so 
wide a circle of visible historical associations as on the 
rampart of Stirling Castle. To begin with the Castle 
itself — what it may have been when, looking towards 
the boundary of the ancient kingdom of Strathclyde, 
anterior to the English and the Scottish monarchies, 
we know not, but the earliest records show its rock 
to have then been, as it was so well fitted to be, the 
site of a powerful fortress. Alexander I. died here 
in 1124. In the earliest efforts of England to estab- 
lish a dominion over Scotland, this fortress is conspi- 
cuous, for when William the Lion was taken prisoner 
in his unsuccessful expedition in the twelfth century, 
he delivered over this castle, along ^-ith Edinburgh, 
Roxburgh, and Berwick, as pledges for his ransom. 
In the war of independence, the rock-crowning fortress 
did its duty well against the invader Edward. It was 
in 1304 the only strength which he had not subdued. 
For three months it held out against his whole army. 
But Edward was not a person to be baffled, if human 
means could accomplish his object. England must 
be drained to the last man ere he would give up his 
point, and so he desired all the besieging implements 
in the Tower to be sent down to Scotland, and called 
on all knights and adventurers to abandon separate 
or personal conflicts, and join his forces at the great 



12 STIRLING HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS. 

siege. Tlie means of attack at that time were but 
ill-fitted to injure buildings on rocks. Stones and 
leaden bullets were projected by springs, but not of 
course with nearly so much eifect as missiles could be 
discharged from above ; and the impatient king, riding 
round the fortress in impotent exasperation, was more 
than once hit and in danger of his life. At length two 
machines were brought up, one of them called the 
wolfe, which is said to have been so high as to over- 
top the walls, and so to pour down masses of stone and 
lead on them, while arrows were discharged conveying 
ignited combustibles. By degrees the walls gave way, 
a breach was made, and by filling the ditch with stones, 
the castle was taken. The English held it for ten years, 
until they were doomed to see the last remnant of the 
force destroyed at Bannockburn, rushing in panic-flight 
beneath its walls. Again, however, it was taken by 
the aspirant to the Scottish throne, Edward Baliol, who 
got the Norman knights who had been driven from 
Scotland to aid him in an attempt which would have 
given them back their estates, and it was only after a 
long and fatal siege that it was recovered from King 
David Bruce. 

THE DOUGLAS ROOM. 

Besides the blood shed in open warfare, Stirling is 
not without its darker tragedies, which made it be 
apostrophised as-^— 

Ye towers ! within whose circuit dread 
A Douglas by his sovereign bled. 

There is a pleasant chamber in the north-west cor- 
ner of the castle with an ancient cornice and some curi- 
oiis decorations. It was here that James II., in a 
moment of incontroUable wrath, stabbed William, Earl 



STIRLING HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS. 13 

of Douglas. Douglas had made a private bond or con- 
federacy with Lords Ross and Crawford. The king 
sought, by a private audience, to persuade him to aban- 
don it ; but the Douglas, as he was powerful, was proud 
and stubborn. The king lost his temper, and, as people 
of all ranks did in those days when they lost temper, 
relieved himself by blood-letting. Drawing a hanger, he 
stabbed the Douglas, saying, " if thou wilt not break 
the bond, this shall." In the newspapers of 14th Octo- 
ber 1797, there appeared the following paragraph, sup- 
posed to refer to this tragedy : — 

" On Thui'sday se'night, as some masons were 
digging a foundation in Stirling Castle, in a garden 
adjacent to the magazine, they struck upon a human 
skeleton about eight yards from the window where the 
Earl of Douglas was thrown over after he was stabbed 
by King James II. It is thought, and there is little 
doubt but what it is his remains, as it is certain that he 
was buried in that garden, but at a little distance from 
the closet window." 

James III. added much to the architectural beauties 
of Stirling, and built, among other portions, the Parlia- 
ment House. He was in some irieasure a martyr to his 
love of architecture, for the rough nobles by whom he 
was surrounded, resented with ferocity his encourage- 
ment to Cochran the architect, whom they hanged on 
the bridge of Lauder. The next reign discloses an in- 
cident of a totally different character connected with the 
Castle. Early in the sixteenth century there came an 
Italian alchemist to Scotland, who was much abused by 
the courtiers for his quackery, and the influence he ob- 
tained over the king. The man seems to have been 
as successful in deceiving himself as any body else. He 
made a pair of wings with which he could fly, and at 
once started with them from the battlements of the 



14 STIRLING HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS. 

Castle. There must have been some good mechanism 
in the wings, for instead of being dashed to pieces he 
only broke his thigh bone. He had a philosophical 
reason to give for his mishap. He had the misfortune 
to use the feathers of a dunghill fowl, which had a na- 
tural attraction for the earth. Had he chosen those of a 
nobler bird the attraction would have been upwards. 
However, he had had enough of it, and tried no more 
flights. Dunbar the poet, who hated him, describes 
the birds tugging at him as he stuck in his flight — 

And ever the cushats at him tu^get ; 
The rooks him rent, the ravens him druggit ; 
The hooded crows his hair forth rugget, 
The heaven he might not bruik. 

Stirling, as these events will shew, had become, at 
an early period, a royal residence, and was long the 
favourite abode of the Scottish monarchs. It was the 
birth-place of James II. and James V. James VI. and 
his eldest son Prince Henry, were both baptised in it ; 
and James V. was crowned in it. 

After many such minor adventures, Stirling was 
taken in a great siege by Monk, from batteries raised 
within the burying-ground of the chiirch, in 1651. In 
the revolution the Jacobites sought to hold a parliament 
here, but the Castle was at once yielded to the new 
government. In 1715, it was held by Argj'le, and 
served its old purpose of bridling the Highlanders, for 
it commanded at that time the only bridge over the 
Forth, and they could only send scattered bodies in 
other directions southwards. In the insurrection of 
1745, the Highlanders made vain attempts to tnke it, 
and they retreated so precipitately as to blow up the 
church of St. Ninian, in which their powder was stored. 
The tower was left standing, and may be seen in the 
hollow from the ramparts of the Castle. The High- 



BANNOCKBUEN. 15 

landers endeavoured to raise works on the northern part 
of the Castlehill ; but they were so far under the forti- 
fied rock that it was said the soldiers in the fortress 
could see the men at the guns in the besieging batteries 
to their very feet ; and any one looking over the ram- 
parts to the north can easily believe it to have been so. 
If we pass from the fortress and look around, the 
area of interesting historical association widens with the 
view. First and most illustrious is the 

BATTLEFIELD OF BANNOCKBURN, 

Where the greatest king of his age had to flee before 
a poor peasantry,- ennobled by the struggle for free- 
dom. The characteristics of the ground which influ- 
enced the battle may still be noticed. Aware that his 
light-armed troops could not encounter the men-at-arms 
of the English, with their full equipment of mail and 
their strong barbs, Brace determined to move from the 
flat ground of the Torwood, stretching eastward along 
the Forth, to ground more suited to the movements of his 
infantry, in the gradual ascent, cleft and broken by the 
burn of Bannock. The spot is still wooded, but it had then 
probably more marsh and timber than it now possesses, 
for both these featm-es were studied by Bruce as a means 
of defence. The ascent will be seen to terminate in a 
pretty abrupt upland, with a gently waving outline ; 
that is the renowned Gillies Hill, where the appearance 
of the camp-followei's, looking like an army of reserve, 
turned the trembling scale of battle, and made the great 
English host, who had been for some time wavering, flee 
in irretrievable confusion. 

But there are commemorations of still older battles 
scattered around. Tacitus tells us in his rapid power- 
ful style, how bitterly Agricola was resisted by the 
Caledonian prince, Galgacus, at the mons Grampius, 



16 STIRLING fflSTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS. 

or the Grampian mountains. The site of the battle 
has been claimed by many spots, and there is no oc- 
casion to enter into the antiquarian merits of the 
several disputes on the siibject ; but one thing is clear 
enough, that in that amphitheatre of mountains stretch- 
ing round from west to north, we have the chain of the 
Grampian hills which the Koman army desired to pene- 
trate, and the Caledonians to defend. Nor are we with- 
out abundant vestiges of the Roman operations. Besides 
the wall of Antoninus, of which the eastern extremity 
touches the Forth in the low flat district to the east, — 
looking in the other direction through the valley sepa- 
rating the Grampians from the OchUs, the eye may 
detect, at the village of Ardoch, the spot where stands 
one of the most perfect specimens of a Roman fortified 
camp to be seen in any part of the world. 

But there are associations in the scene around older 
still than the days of Rome. Her remains have been 
found here and there on the surface of the flat carse, 
showing us by undoubted evidence how long the waters 
have receded from it, or rather that at that age they 
had receded ; how much earlier who yet can tell. We 
need not enter into the somewhat vexed question whether 
the discovery of remains bearing the work of human 
hands have been authenticated as discovered in such 
alluvial deposits ; but certainly in the Carse of Stirling 
remains of animals of the organisation of the present 
age have been abundantly found. " The most remark- 
able animal remains," says the author of the statistical 
account of Logic, conspicuous by Craigforth Hill, " found 
in this parish in this deposit was the entire skeleton of 
a whale, which, according to the measurements which 
were made, must have been 70 feet long. It was found 
in the year 1819, in the course of some draining opera- 
tions carrying on by the late Sir Robert Abercromby, 



CARSE OF STIBUNG. 17 

on the estate of Airthrey. The place where it was 
found was adjoining the south side of the turnpike road 
east from the eastern porter's lodge which leads to 
Airthrey Castle, and near to the north verge of the 
alluvial deposit of the river Forth. The hones were in 
general hard and undecayed, and lay in regular connected 
order from the head to the tail. They were imbedded 
in the blue silt, immediately under the silt clay. It 
was found, from very accurate levels taken, that this 
skeleton lay 22 feet higher than the pitch of the present 
highest stream tides of the river Forth, immediately 
opposite." 

Who shall say how long before Agricola passed over 
it these bones may have been stranded by the tide of a 
firth running up the carse, till it touched the spiws of 
the Highland mountains ? And again, how long before 
the existence of this whale it may have been that the 
animals studied by the palaeontologist in the red sand- 
stone stretching beneath the diluvial deposit may have 
sported in an ocean of different aspect and temperature 
from the present? 

But to come back, in the first place, to Agricola as 
a comparatively modem association, we overleap some 
sixteen or seventeen centuries, and still armies are found 
marching in the same track to memorable battles. In 
the affair of 1715, the troops of the Earl of Mar rested 
a night within the old Roman camp of Ardoch, on their 
way to the battle-ground of Sheriffmuir, a broad low up- 
land northward of where the smoke of the small cathe- 
dral town of Dunblane is seen curling to the sky. 
When Argyle marched to meet the enemy he left a 
party of militia at Stirling, The first intimation they 
had of the battle was the sight of a part of their own 
army rushing back as defeated fugitives. It naturally 
overwhelmed them with the notion that all was lost ; 



t8 STIRLING — HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS. 

they were ignorant that Argyle was pursuing a larger 
part of the enemy in the other direction. 

Again, looking eastward along the level carse to- 
wards the Forth, across the ground which, in the days 
of the war of independence, was covered with the great 
oak forest called the Tor Wood, we look on the fields of 
other battles, both in early and later times. Just where 
the ground slightly rises, and the smoke of the Falkirk 
forges hovers over it, the liberator Wallace had a disas- 
trous conflict with Edward, in the year 1298. Again, 
almost on the same spot, was fought the later battle of 
Falkirk in the year '45. It much resembled that which 
has just been alluded to at Sheriffmuir ; in the later 
battle the Highlanders, however, had a greater advan- 
tage over the government troops than Argjle had over 
the rebels in '15. The English general was the re- 
nowned Hawley, a pedantic and severe commander, who 
despised the undisciplined Highlanders, and built some 
gibbets to hang them on. He was obliged to employ 
them in punishing his own troops for fleeing — a harsh 
measure, as he was one of the fugitives himself. 

We now go back again into hoar antiquity ere we 
have done with another memorable battle-field or two. 
You see a tall grey tower, more feudal than monastic in 
its character, to the eastward, and among the links of 
the Forth, which seem to have twisted themselves round 
it like a huge snake. That is the remnant of the abbey 
of Oambuskenneth, and marks the spot where Wallace, 
in his short successful career, gained the victory over 
Cressingham, usually called the battle of Stirling. The 
abbey itself is well worthy of attention, and has had its 
owTi history. Its monks were a wealthy and powerful 
body, as the luxuriance of the alluvial land all around 
testifies. They had often witliin their precincts not only 
entertained kings and their courts, but even accommo- 



STIRLING HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS. 19 

dated their parliaments ; and it is believed on very 
good authority, that here met for the first time the re- 
presentatives of the mnnicipal corporations of Scotland. 
The occasion on which they were assembled was a 
proud one — it was to continue in David Bruce, the son 
of the victorious Robert, the succession to the Scottish 
crown. 

In the year 1488, a dead body, found on the way- 
side, was brought within the abbey, and received royal 
obsequies. Whether it was the body of a king has been 
ever doubted, and the reasons on either side involve a 
tragic history, only too characteristic of the old state of 
Scotland. When the son of James III. was in rebel- 
lion against him, the king advanced on Stirling, and 
demanded admittance to that, one of his chief fortresses, 
but it was refused, and a battle occurred between the 
king's forces and those of the bisurgents, led by his 
son, afterwards the clever and popular monarch James 
IV., who fell at Flodden. The battle, if it can fairly 
receive that dignified name, was fought at Little Cong- 
lar, on the side of a brook called Sauchie-Burn, about 
a mile from Bannockburn. King James, who was a 
weak man, took the advice of some followers, who 
recommended him to see to his own safety, and, all 
attired in burnished armour, he galloped along the un- 
frequented road. A wayside house called Beaton's 
Mill, remarkable for the thickness of its walls, and cer- 
tainly very old, is still pointed out as the house whence a 
woman then issued to draw water from a well. Alarmed 
by the startling apparition of the king, in full armour, 
galloping along on horseback, she dropped her pitchei' 
and fled into the mill house. Her motions, in their turn, 
frightened the king's horse, which fell. Either hurt 
or smothered in his heavy armour, the king lay as if 
dead. He was conveyed into the mill house, and laid 



20 BATTLE OF SAUCHIEBURN. 

on a bed. Abjectly depressed, and fearing immediate 
death, he told the people of th^ mill that he was the 
king, and prayed for a confessor. Thereupon a woman, 
perhaps the same whose precipitancy had caused the 
accident, ran out calling frantically for a priest to come 
and shrive. the king. Friends and enemies were about 
in abundance at the time. A man clothed in a dark 
mantle, like an ecclesiastic, said, "I am a priest," and 
followed the woman into the house. He asked the 
king how it fared with him, and the king said he was 
80 ill that he desired to confess, and receive absolution. 
Thereupon the man in the dark mantle, bending down 
over him, as if to receive the whispered confession, 
stabbed him with a dagger, and not quite sure that the 
work was effectively done, stabbed him over and over 
again, till he was certainly dead, and then vanished as 
mysteriously as he had come. The people in the mill 
house had only the word of the man killed on their bed 
that he was their king. There was a mystery over the 
whole affair, and scarcely anything is absolutely known, 
save that James was never seen more. The people of 
the mill house, apparently not knowing what to do 
with the body, threw it forth ; and so all that can be 
in reality vouched for, is the statement of its having 
been buried, along with other royal clay, as the body of 
a king, in Cambuskenneth's Abbey grey. 

Such are a few of the incidents rendering remark- 
able the landscape spread before the visitor to 

THE RAMPARTS 

of Stirling Castle. It is almost needless to call his 
attention to the visible beauties around him. To the 
east and north are the fruitful lowlands, with the Forth 
making windings through alluvial soil, the richness of 
which has occasioned the rhyming proverb — 



STIRLING CASTLE RAMPARTS. 21 

A crook of the Forth 

Is worth an earldom in the north. 

The description which Drayton has given of the 
Ouse, has been often supposed very applicable to the 
windings of the Forth, especially when he says that the 

river 

" in measured gyres doth whirl herself about : 

That, this way, here, and there, back, forward, in. and out : 
And, like a sportive nymph, oft doubling in her gait. 
In labyrinth-like turns, and twinings intricate, 

TTirough those rich fields doth run." 

And so the river winds away through the flat fruit- 
ful alluvial carse, until it is seen expanding gradually 
into the Firth, which, between its green hilly banks, 
looks like a pretty inland lake. 

It is on the other side, however, that the most in- 
teresting landscape is seen in the panorama pf the 
Highland hills — the mysterious land of precipice, 
forest, and cataract, to which the tourist is on his way. 
With Ben Lomond raising its graceful peak in the ex- 
treme left, there follow in succession, Benvenue, Ben- 
ledi, and the cone of Benvoirlich, ending with tlie 
humbler summit of Uam-var. On the right a good eye 
will detect Bemnore, and some of the more distant hills, 
just peeping over the shoulders of the nearer range. 
Differing utterly from a sojourn among their stiff as- 
cents, their bewildering valleys, and their roaring im- 
passable streams, is the gentle outline of the range of 
the Grampians, when standing like a picture against 
the blue sky. But particularly fortunate is the tourist 
who sees this panorama in one of the warm rich sxmsets 
peculiar to Scotland. Then the outline of the moun- 
tains is more distinct than ever, but every asperity is 
smoothed away and steeped in the gcilden richness of 
the atmosphere, which throws a deep purple tinge even 
into the shadows of the mountain range. 



22 STIRLING CASTLE GEOLOGY. 



GEOLOGY. 

We ought not to leave Stirling Castle without a view 
of the geological character of the rock, which is verj' 
beautiful and interesting. It is chiefly a greenstone trap, 
and its conjunction with the sandstone may be observed 
in several places producing the usual effect of quartzose, 
liardeuing of the latter. In some cuttings on the north 
side of the rock, Dr. M'Culloch foimd a phenomenon, of 
which he gave an account in the first volume of the 
transactions of the Geological Society. It shews the 
trap catching up and bending in folds through its own 
mass the sandstone strata : and affording a means of 
opening up discussion on the connection of neptunion 
and plutinic action, which we would not venture to 
anticipate. The Castle Rock, Craigforth, and the Abbey 
Craig, are all of the same formation, — masses of green- 
stone trap, protruded by some internal combustion 
through the flat sandstone rocks of the coal field around. 
When the flat river haugh all around was a higher 
reach of the estuary of the Forth, these must have been 
rocks projecting out of the water, against which ships 
may have been wrecked. They have a tendency to 
be columnar and basaltic, which at a distance gives 
them, especially when the sun shines on them, a verj' 
beautiful and airy appearance, heightened by a kind of 
metallic lustre.

Before attending the stranger to the mountain chain 
of which he had so tempting a glance from the ram- 
part of the Castle, we must glance at the objects of 
interest in the immediate neighbourhood, and indicate 
the principal detours to be made from Stirling. If he 
desires historical association rather than scenery, he 
will bend his steps to the field of Bannockbum, all 
parts of which are accessible by an easy walk. But 
there is nothing particularly to strike the attention in 
the spot justly called the Marathon of Scotland ; and 
except, perhaps, that the ridge of the celebrated Gillie's 
Hill and its concern with the battle is better seen and 
understood from below, it may be said that a better idea 
is derived of the character of the battle-groimd from 
Stirling Castle than a closer inspection. The visitor 
to the spot finds himself in a well-ploughed agricultural 
district, penetrated by a small stream, which leads him 



24 BANNOCKBURN BATTLE-FIELD. 

to a manufacturing village which has spread far and 
wide the renown of Bannockbum woollens. There are 
scarcely any features which profess to be memorials of 
the battle, save " the bore stone" in which the Scottish 
standard is reputed to have been raised. The sole 
fragment of it left by the zeal of relic hunters has been 
bound in iron to protect it from farther destmction, and 
may be seen on an eminence called Brock's Brae, to 
the south-west of St. Ninian's. On this battle-field, no 
touters have impudence enough to profess to sell or 
shew relics of tlie fight ; indeed, scarcely a vestige 
of the heap of armour scattered over the field, or the 
numerous bones buried in it, has been discovered within 
the memory of man. The last relic found on Ban- 
nockbum was a rotten sword blade, turned up by the 
workmen employed in draining Halberd's Bog, where 
Bmce dug the concealed pits for bafiling the approach 
of the English horse. In this short walk the stranger 
may see the steeple of St. Ninian's, left when the 
church was blown up by the rebels, as well as the 
spring of St. Ninian's, deemed a natural curiosity froni 
the enormous volume with which it gushes forth. 

The line of elevations towards the .south, called the 
Campsie Fells, will be of little interest to any one but 
a geologist. The highest point is not above 1500 feet 
above the level of the sea, and its elevation is gradual. 
The chain consists generally of trap amorphic and 
columnar. On the declivity, about five miles from 
Stirling, there is a curious cascade called Gibnour's 
I^inn, possessing the peculiarity of a cavern behind the 
water, whence one can look through it ; and, without 
instituting farther comparisons, it may at least be said 
that the operation can be performed without the sense 
of insecurity felt in passing through the hollow way 
beneath Niagara. On the way to the pretty dell

pierced by this stream is passed the venerable fortalice 
of Touch, a residence of the Seton family, consisting of 
an ancient battlemented square tower, with additions 
in the massive Vanburgh style. It stands amid oak 
trees, remarkable in this pait of Scotland for their age 
and girth. 

STIRLING TO CAMBUSKENNETH AND THE FORTH. 
The Ferry 1 mile.— The Abbey IJ mile. 

A visit to " Cambiiskenneth's Abbey grey" will 
repay the ecclesiologist, who will find it a fine specimen 
of the early English or first pointed Gothic, though the 
only part remaining entire, the tower, is of a more 
heavy, massive, and Norman-looking character than the 
pointed architecture generally assumes in England. It 
is best reached by a boat in its neighbourhood from the 
opposite side of the Forth. In attempting to proceed 
to it by its own side of the river, one is swept round 
some miles of provoking windings. The Forth here, 
and for about half-a-mile above StMing, is tidal, and 
therefore the banks, except at high water, are slimy and 
unpleasant. It may as well be mentioned, indeed, that 
throughout the Carse of Stirling the river is best seen 
at a distance. The banks are muddy, and the stream 
winds past them, stained and sluggish like many an 
English river. At the same time, being of mountain 
origin, it is subject to inundations which rend the banks 
and cover the trees hanging from them witli ragged 
streamers from the spoils of the river.

THE OLD BRIDGE. 

The old bridge of Stirling, which will at once 
be distinguished from its spruce modern neighbour, is 
not only an interesting piece of architecture, but re- 
markable for its historical associations. It existed long 
before there was any bridge upon the Tay, or any other 
bridge over the Forth, and was thus absolutely the 
gate between the north and the south. Nor was it a 
very broad or even gate, but narrow, tortuous, and 
steep. Its inconvenience suggested the erection of the 
modem bridge by its side, but, with great good taste, 
the old structure, though superseded, was not removed. 
It was near or upon the old bridge that Archbishop 
Hamilton, who will be mentioned in connection with 
Dumbarton, was hanged. 

ABBEY CRAIG. 

The most considerable elevation close to Stirling is 
that beautiful cluster of precipitous rocks rising through 
a rich maze of sylvan verdure, called the Abbey Craig. 
It rises to a height of 560 feet — a crest of rock over- 
topping a talus or bank, and commands one of the 
finest views of Stirling and the surrounding country. 
The rock is a greenstone, with so peculiarly lustrous 
and hard a crystalline fracture, that it has often been 
used for mill-stones. 



OCHILS BEN CLEUCH. * 27 



OCHILS AND DAMYAT. 



Of the mountain range of the Ochils, the nearest 
and most picturesque is Damyat, in form more resem- 
bling the Highland mountains than its flat-topped 
neighbours. To one of these, however, very flat and 
round, called Ben Clench, belongs the palm of height 
— it is 2400 feet above the sea level. A great object 
in surmounting it — besides the innate satisfaction of 
climbing a hill, which has indescribable charms for some 
ambitious minds — is the noble prospect from the top. 
It has to be noticed that the highest hills do not always 
afford the most distinct and comprehensive panoramas. 
Those which rise from the centre of great mountain 
clusters sometimes give the spectator a confused impres- 
sion, from the crowd of tops around, as if he were on some 
great consolidated sea. From the summit of Ben 
Cleuch, however, you look straight across the broad 
green intervening valley to the Grampian range on the 
other side, rising, though so distant, as clear and dis- 
tinct as the opposite side of a street from your drawing- 
room window. The hills can be all singled out, from 
Ben Lomond to Ben Lawers, in one distinct and beau- 
tiful chain, the outlines of their peaked summits 
becoming clearly visible against the sky. The scene 
in some degree resembles the panorama of the Alps 
from the summit of the Righi in Switzerland, deficient, 
of course, in the snowy summits and blue glaciers 
which make so prominent a figure in that scene. 

The Ochils furnish a rich field to the geologist and 
mineralogist. The general character of the range is 
that of a great igneous mound, developing itself in 
amygdoloid felspar and porphyry, and occasionally in 
fine pentagonal columns of basaltic greenstone. Its 
structure used to be well seen to the traveller in the 



28 ocuiLs. 

deep romantic valley of Glen Farg, throiigh which the 
old post road to Perth winded. The clinkstone might 
there be seen in curved beds ; and Professor Nicol 
enimaerates among the minerals obtainable, analcime, 
mesotype, stilbite, prehnite, and konilite. On the 
metaJiferous character of the range, the same writer 
says — " Some metallic veins are found in these rocks, 
particularly in the clinkstone. From one in the Wood- 
hill, near Alva, £50,000 or £60,000 worth of silver is 
said to have been extracted, and it also contained 
peach- blossom coloured cobalt ore. In the hills near 
this, not less than fourteen or fifteen veins, containing 
ores of silver, cobalt, lead, copper, or iron, are known. 
In the Gloom Hill, near Castle Campbell, a vein was 
formerly wrought, the ores being lead, copper, and 
silver, along with heavy spar. Copper has also been 
found at Blair Logic and Airthrey, in a dark-coloured 
tufa — the vein at the latter being from four to five feet 
wid^, and, besides the copper, also furnishes ores of 
lead, cobalt, and silver." 

The scenery of the Ochils is peculiar, and unlike 
any other in Scotland. At a distance they look like 
steep mounds running in a straight line, as uniform as 
if they were artificially raised and smoothened, and thus 
seem to be destitute of breaks and variety of scenery. 
Biit they are cut by deep clefts, so narrow as not to be 
visible at a distance, and all the more striking from 
that characteristic. The sides of these clefts are very 
steep and precipitous, and the banks, with precipices 
between, so close that it would seem no great feat to 
throw a stone across from hill to hill. In the lowest 
level of these cavities there generally runs a brook on 
its brawling course, struggling among great boulders 
fallen from the impendmg rocks, leaping over stony 
shelves, or sweeping, scarcely visible, between cliffs 



ALLOA CLACKMAJfNAN TOWER. 29 

which almost over-arch it. These glens are silent and 
uninhabited ; indeed, they are too narrow and steep to 
be dwelt in ; yet, as the manufacturing villages of the 
plain below, such as Tillicoultry, are brought close up 
to the sudden rise of the hills, for the sake of getting 
the advantage of the water-power, one is sometimes 
startled, in these narrow secluded glens, by the distant 
snort of a steam-engine. 

STIRLING TO ALLOA. 

The best way to reach Alloa is by RaiL 
Alloa House, J mile. — Clackmannan Tower, 1| mile. 
The town of Alloa, where the river Forth widens into 
the firth or estuary, is a seaport town, containing five 
or six thousand inhabitants, possessed of considerable 
trade and manufactures, and a hereditary fame for the 
brewing of good ale. Close by are the modern mansion 
and the remains of the ancient mansion of the Earls of 
Mar, with a considerable stretch of pleasure-ground, 
decorated with ancestral trees. The turbulent ambi- 
tious Earl of Mar, who headed the rebellion of 1715, 
had, with other restless men, his gentler pursuits, and 
among them was a taste for laying out pleasure-grounds, 
in which he here greatly indulged. 

CLACKMANNAN TOWER. 

The square grim mass of old masonry called Clack- 
mannan Tower, stands conspicuously enough on the sum- 
mit of a windy hill, two miles from Alloa. To reach it, 
it is necessary to pass through the capital of the county 
of Clackmannan, the village of that ilk, as dirty and poor 
a double strip of road-lining houses as ever sent forth 
its collection of dogs to bark and children to stare at the 
passing wayfarer. Clackmannan Tower claims associa-

tion with the great King Robert Bruce, and it certainly 
was an abode of the Bruces. Some sixty years have 
now elapsed since the fortalice was inhabited by a veri- 
table descendant of the Bruces — collaterals of the royal 
house. The old Lady Clackmannan, as Mrs. Bruce of 
Clackmannan was called, had a full sense of her heredi- 
tary dignity, which she supported chiefly through the 
potent influence of a helmet and two-handed sword, 
which she devoutly believed had been the property of 
the great King Robert. She was much admired in her 
day as a fine specimen of the old hardy high-spirited 
Scottish gentlewoman. When she chose to extend her 
august approval to a gentleman visitor, she would knight 
him with the two-handed sword, and she did not by 
any means believe this to be a barren distinction.

the conquering progress of Napoleon ; and one who, to 
the greatest bravery and military skill, \mited a simple 
humane heart and honest purposes. 



DOLLAR CASTLE CAMPBELL. 31 

DOLLAR. 

[Inn : — Campbell.] 

The village of Dollar is presided over by a deco- 
rous-looking academy — an establishment with a consi- 
derable foundation for teachers. On a rock projecting 
into one of the clefts of the Ochils, more broken and 
varied than the others, stand the i-uins of 

CASTLE CAMPBELL. 

This old fortress of the Argyle family looks down on 
the village of Dollar. To reach the Castle a considerable 
ascent has to be made. Unless a very toilsome and 
even dangerous scramble is attempted up the projecting 
rock on which it stands, it is necessary to keep the 
upper level of the hill, and to descend on it by the 
neck of land leading to its projecting cliff. The Castle 
of Gloom, as it was called of old, is altogether peculiar. 
There is no other Scottish castellated ruin like it. It 
looks as if it were got up for some Italian chief's strong- 
hold, to act the mysteries of Udolpho in. All around 
stretches on the hill sides a deep dark forest line. It is 
like Thomson's description in the Castle of Indolence — 

Full in the passage of the vale, above, 

A sable, silent, solemn forest stood ; 

Wliere nought but shadowy forms was seen to move, 

As Idless fancied in her dreaming mood : 

And up the hills, on either side, a wood 

Of blackening pines, aye waving to and fro, 

Sent forth a sleepy horror through the blood. 

The forest coating of the hill sides, however, is 
broken by a precipitous gulf on either side of the 
castle, which makes the rock on which it stands a sort 
of peninsula. At the foot of each is a stream, and the 
two, meeting in front, rush united to join the Devon. 
The precipitous descent on either side, amid broken 



38 THE DEVON. 

rocks, creeping wild flowers, and the mouldering remains 
of ancient trees, has its charms for the adventurous 
scrambler. One feature of the rock is very remarkable — 
a narrow cut into its face, clean and shiarp as if it 
had been just made with a gigantic hatchet. It is 
called Kemp's score, and tradition says that John Knox 
made it a place of abode, but with what rational view 
he can have done so, it is not easy to conceive. 

The architecture of the castle is almost as remark- 
able as its site. Part of it has an air of grim strength, 
but the other portions are light, elegant, and highly de- 
corated. There is a noble hall with ribbed vaulting, 
where the visitor is sometimes startled when his eye in- 
cidentally catches two grim faces cut in stone, seeming 
to glare down on him. 

This castle was a possession of the great Argyle 
family, distant from their semi-regal territories in Argyle- 
shire. It suffered, along w ith the neighbouring village, 
for its ownership in the great civil w^ars ; and Mon- 
trose, on his way from the north to the field of Kilsyth, 
attacked and burned it. Perhaps it never was restored 
as a feudal residence after that time.

devil's mill. 33 

Passing up the stream, between two and three miles 
above Dollar, there is a complete cluster of striking 
scenes, formed by the Devon cutting its way through 
the chain of the Ochil hills. To visit these, it is ne- 
cessary to return to Dollar, and from thence to take 
the high road westwards to the left ; but to the pedes - 
trian, it both saves distance and gives a more iate- 
resting journey, to strike off to the right a little beyond 
the main bridge, and pass by Cowden and Muchart 
Mill, towards Blair Hill, where he will reach the finest 
scene of the cluster — the Cauldron Linn. If he prefer 
keeping the best to the last, he can take the regular 
road to Rumbling Bridge Inn, as above, and return 
this way. 

" THE devil's AHLl" 

Is reached through a footpath among the trees, very 
close to the edge of the rocks. If you ask why it 
is so named, you are told it is owing to Sabbath 
desecration, because the mill in fact works all Sun- 
day. But the denomination is more probably attri- 
butable to a curious propensity for awarding pieces 
of grand scenery as the peculiar property of the author 
of e\al. He seems to possess something of this kind in 
every part of the world. It is difficult to classify this 
phenomenon, except by saying, that it is a sort of general 
hurry skurry of water among the rocks. It is not pro- 
perly a waterfall, or properly a rapid, but partakes of 
both, and of every thing else that is confused and noisy 
and turbulent.

trees, some old and rotting, others in their fresh youth, 
and at intervals caught here and there deep deep down the 
white ravings of the furious river — such are the ohjects 
seen from the bridge, amid the din of hollow roaring. 
There are temptations to the adventurous to scramble 
about here and there to obtain more distinct views of 
what is going on among all the noise below ; but it is 
nervous work, not fitted for fluctuating heads or un- 
steady feet — in fact it had better be let alone. The 
present bridge, crossed by the road, a goodly stone para- 
peted arch, is far too steady to deserve the old name of 
the Rumbling Bridge. That applied to a small narrow 
arch, without a parapet, which will be seen stuck be- 
tween the rocks under the expanding arch of the new 
bridge, as if some one had dropped it into the cleft, and 
it had stuck there and could not be got out again. It 
must have been an unpleasant operation to ride or drive 
across that bridge. 

THE CAULDRON LINN, 

A very striking waterfall — one of the finest in Scot- 
land. At two bounds the river clears its way from 
the range of the Ochil chain into the vale below. 
Standing near the edge of the upper fall we look 
through a narrow opening in the rock sheer into the 
valley, where the river, snow-white and furious at 
our feet as it takes its leap, is seen meandering calm 
and tranquil, as if it had madly leaped no barriers, 
and no rocks impeded its dimpled stream. Taking 
the opposite view, and looking up from the vale 
below, the white cataract is seen winding its way in 
indefinite reaches upwards through the black rocks, 
as if it came from some strange unknown world far 
behind. The top of the pit above is so narrow that 
people have been tempted to leap across ; distances,

however, are deceptive in such places, the senses reel, 
and footings are slippery. The water has bored many 
round holes in the black basaltic rock, whence it is 
supposed to have got its name of Cauldron, from the 
likeness of the same to great cast-iron cauldrons boiling 
eternally — one (jf these, peculiarly large, is at the stage 
between the two falls, where the water takes an eccen- 
tric gyration before taking its second leap. An adven- 
turous tourist, who attempted the leap at the edge, after 
being shot down the first fall, was discharged into this 
cauldron, where his friends above saw him. His posi- 
tion was awfully critical, for the whirling of the waters 
made the greater part of the contents of the cauldron 
a sort of quicksand, and there he was gradually settling 
down beyond human relief. Some one ran to a neigh- 
bouring village, and a rope was got at the critical 
moment, the water approaching close to his lips ; but a 
gentle hold of the rope enabled him to keep above the 
insidious quicksands, and he was saved.

Xestling itself in the sun, behind wooded spurs of the 
mountain range, which protects it from the north and 
the east wind — those two terrors of the delicate-lunged 
in Scotland. This is now in the hey-day of its reputa- 
tion, as the most popular watering-place in Scotland* 
Its primary attraction is the Airthrey mineral springs, 
four in number, and with as many divergencies of medi- 
cinal character. They were discovered dming the work- 
ing of thfe Airthrey copper mine. It is an important 
consideration for those who sojourn here, that the neigh- 
bouring landowners have with wise liberality made it 
their business to render the place attractive by the free 
use of their grounds.

[/»Hj .• — Kinross'.] 

The Cathedral, partly used as the parish church, 
is in better condition than many of the ecclesiastical re- 
mains in Scotland. The nave is in the oldest pointed 
style, the choir of a period rather later, when mullions 
were filled into the Tvindows, and decoration was making 
progress. The tower is evidently the oldest of all, 
haWng decided marks of Norman work. Some of the 
prebends' oaken stalls and other pieces of carved work 
liave been preserved, and there is a recumbent stone 
effigy of a man in armour, one of the powerful lords 
of Strathallan. The chief celebrity of the see of Dun- 
blane is in its cemetery. One of its bishops was the 
celebrated Leighton, who left his library, still preserved, 
to the clergy of the diocese. 



SHERIFFMUIR ARDOCU CAMP. 6 1 

Leaving Dunblane by tbe north road, and (6) turn- 
ing to the right through the plantations of Kippendavie, 
we may visit the field of 

SHERIFFMUIR, 

Already referred to under the account of Stirling. It is a 
bleak windy muir, now partly covered with a dwai-fish 
plantation of fir trees, in which stands a stone railed 
round, called by the country people the battle stone. 
The character of the muir explains the awkward nature 
of the conflict, from the two armies not facing each 
other. This arose from the curve of the ground which 
prevented them from seeing each other until close at 
hand. Hence it came about that the right wing of 
either was victorious over the enemy's left, and that 
portions of the two armies fled in opposite directions, 
justifying the sarcastic poetical description — 

There's some say that we wan, 

Some say that they wan, 

Some say that nane wan at a', man ; 

But ae thing I'm sure, 

That at Sheriffmuir, 

A battle there was which I saw, man ; 

And we ran, and they ran, 

And they ran, and we ran, 

And we ran, and they ran awa, man. 

(12) Ardoch house and grounds (Major Moray 
Stirling), in which may be seen the 

ROMAN CAMP OF ARDOCH, 

Already mentioned. It is remarkably well kept, and 
the several ridges of the square station are nearly 
as sharp and distinct as the glacis of a modern for- 
tress. It will amply repay the visit of the student 
of Roman castramentation. He will find it to contain 
remains of three different objects. First, a station or

citadel, with its large permanent embankments. Next, 
the remains of a heptagonal area of a very distinct 
character, which may be \'iewed as a porcestrium ; and 
third, the remains of two parallelogram camps, such as 
armies threw up on the march. Notwithstanding these 
well sounding names, however, it is but fair to tell the 
tourist uninterested in castramentation, that he will not 
see anything in these fragmentary mounds to astonish 
him. The archaeologist, however, will ; and if he 
desire, after seeing them, to study them farther, we can 
but refer to Sandy Gordon, who, when he wrote his 
Ttinerarium Septentrionale, saw the remains in a more 
complete state, to Roy's Military antiquities, and to 
Stuart's Caledonia Romana. 

In the neighbourhood there are several hill forts, 
and the glen of Kincardine, covered with underwood, 
where a small stream forms many cascades. The ruins 
of two castles have a traditionary interest — the one, 
called Kincardine, was the seat of the family of Mon- 
trose, and as such was dismantled by Argyle in retalia- 
tion for the destruction of Castle Campbell. Another, 
called Castle Ogilvie, is supposed to have been the 
place to which Dundee retired for safety when he was 
concocting the war against the revolution. 

Six miles distant is a place of another kind, the vil- 
lage of Auchterarder, which the traveller will see dis- 
tinctly enough if he be travelling by rail to Perth. It 
is renowned in ecclesiastical controversy, ha^^ng not 
only Antnessed the commencement of the proceedings 
which ended in the disruption of the Church of Scot- 
land, and the formation of the Free Church in 1843, 
but having been also very conspicuous in the early part 
of last century by the " Auchterarder Test," the con- 
flicts about which were mainly instrumental in produc- 
ing the secession. 



TULLIBARDINE. 39 

There are no old houses in this or the neighbour- 
ing villages, as they were burned down by the insur- 
gents in 1715, to prevent them from affording shelter to 
Argj'le's army. There are, however, many pleasant and 
varied scenes among the mountains, which make the spot 
a very agreeable place of sojourn for a summer week, and 
report speaks favourably of the trouting in the streams. 
About three miles from Auchterarder, in the parish of 
Blackford, is Tullibardine, which affords the second title 
of the Duke of Athole, and is so well known in connec- 
tion with the '45. There is an ancient ruined chapel 
on the ground, and one or two aged thorn trees have a 
curious history. Old Lyndsay of Pitscottie tells an 
almost fabulous history of a wonderful ship built in 
James the Fourth's time, to contain a thousand men. 
It used up all the oak timber in Fifeshire, which may 
be true enough, without its being also true what Pits- 
cottie says, that she was " the largest ship ever seen 
before." He concludes by saying, " Her length and 
breadth is planted in hawthorn at Tullibardine by the 
Wright that helped to make her." But the remaining 
trees are too scanty to furnish a plan and elevation of 
the wonderful ship. Another interesting spot is Glen 
Eagles, a wild sequestered ravine, the seat of the once 
celebrated family of Haldane of Glen Eagles. Here 
too is a ruined chapel, and many hill forts and tumuli 
are scattered about.

as well as of the Highland mountains rising abrupt

the Englishman think that Scotland is not so different 
from his native country after all. In a few miles, how- 
ever, he will come to symptoms of a country not so old 
in peaceful Avealth as his own, and indicative of com- 
paratively late reclamation from barrenness. [1^) The 
first mansion-house passed on the left is Craigforth 
(Thomas Smith, Esq.), long possessed by the family of 
Callender, nestling among trees under the shadow of 
the rock already mentioned, whose name it bears. 
(4) On the left is the corner, as it were, of the original 
cake of moss which lay heavy over all the now fruit- 
ful carse, and still covers a large portion of its interior 
surface. Part of it is called Flanders Moss, evidently 
from its similarity to the tracts of heath land near the 
lower Ehine ; and one part of the reclaimed territory is 
named the Polder — the term applied to fields recovered 
from the sea in Holland. Near the spot where it begins, 
a tree-covered tiunulus will be seen on the left hand 
side. It is of a kind numerous in Scotland, and two 
of them, farther down the valley of the Forth between 
Stirling and Falkirk, have been celebrated in history as 
Dunipace Hills. The symmetrical outline of such emi- 
nences, and the gravelly and travelled character of their 
contents, has generally led to the belief that they are 
artificial, and cover the bones of great kings or heroes. 
The traditions of the countiy have universally given 
them such an artificial origin, and no doubt many 
great tumuli were built by the aboriginal British ; but, 
occurring in flat alluvial places, geologists have now 
found a difterent origin for them, and they are sup- 
posed to have been ancient islands or shallows formed 
by the peculiar currents of the waters which formerly 
covered the flat land around, which have been left on 
their subsidence.

right. (5) A road on the right strikes, winding among 
wood, through which may be partially seen Blair-Dnim- 
mond house (Home Drummond, Esq.) If the tourist 
should desire a closer examination than the partial 
glimpse through the trees presents, it is understood 
that the family are liberal in permitting access to their 
gi'ounds. The source of chief interest to the spot is its 
having been the abode of Lord Kames. 

Leaving the flat carse land, we edge up through 
gently broken ground, and at the sixth mile, near the 
modern church of Kincardine, the roads fork — that 
to Callander taking the right hand, while the way to 
Monteith and Aberfoyle is to the left. At eight miles 
from Stirling the ground is more deeply broken, and 
we are among scenery and baronial associations at the 
village of 

(8) DOUNE. 

[/mm.- — Macintyre'i Woodside of Donne] 

Here the Teith is spanned by a noble bridge — the 
work of one who, though by craft a tailor, was thoroughly 
noble in heart. An inscription, pretty legible, empanel- 
led in the left hand parapet, tells us that, in the year of 
God 1535, founded was this bridge by Robert Spital, 
tailor to the most noble Princess Margaret, the Queen 
of James IV. Along with the nan-ative he boldly 
blazons the distinctive sign of his profession, a pair of 
scissors en saltier. There is an old popular rhyme 
about this bridge, bringing it into association with a 
bridge of Callander, long since gone, and spoken of as 
old while the Doune bridge is new. 

The new brig o' Doune and the auld brig o' Callander, 
Four-and-twenty bows on the auld brig o' Callander. 

The four-and-twenty bows seem to refer to ribs of the 



DOUNE CASTLE. 43 

arches ; but what is farther meant we must leave the 
reader to determine, unbiassed by any opinion of ours. 

DOUXE CASTLE. 

Above the humble tailor's bridge frown in feudal 
grandeur the towers of Murdoch of Albany's strong- 
hold, roofless and ruinous, but still a majestic pile, with 
its two massive square towers, its machicolations and 
turrets, its high embattled walls projecting forward in 
defiance, and, most striking of all, its fine commanding 
site, which spreads its dusky masses above the woods 
lining the steep banks of Teith to the water's edge. A 
fine rambling place does the old castle make for an 
idle forenoon, with its spiral stair-cases, its dungeons, 
and its parapet walks. Nor is it without its own inci- 
dental history. The minister of the parish, in his 
statistical account, says, " It seems to be unquestionable 
that the knight of Snowdoun had slept at Doune Castle 
on the night previous to the chase ; " and we shall not 
gainsay him. But there are events connected with it 
fiilly more distinctly ascertained. Murdoch, Duke of 
Albany, who governed the country when James I. was 
a prisoner in England, possessed this stronghold, and 
probably built it. The young king, when he returned, 
struck the whole family of Albany with fatal vengeance 
for the ambition which they had shown ; and the old 
governor himself was executed on the castle hill of Stir- 
ling, whence he could see the towers of his own semi- 
regal fortress. It became subsequently a royal resi- 
dence ; and the names of several queens of Scotland, 
including of course Queen Mary, are mentioned as hav- 
ing been its inmates. The reader of Waverley will 
remember that Doune Castle figures there as a fortress 
with a janitor and a governor, Donald Stewart, " Lieu-

tenant-Colonel in the service of his Royal Highness 
Prince Charles Edward." It was natural that the 
Jacobite army should make the most of it, for it was 
for some time the only fortalice which they preserved in 
Scotland. Here John Home, the author of Douglas, 
was actually a prisoner in their hands, and performed an 
achievement for which he ever afterwards deemed him- 
self entitled to assume the air of a great warrior. 
Home had been a volunteer, and was taken prisoner at 
the battle of Falkirk. With five others he was shut up 
in a chamber deemed sufficiently far from the ground to 
render escape unlikely. Instigated, however, by the 
adventurous spirit of the poet, they twisted their bed- 
clothes into ropes, and descended one by one. The 
parts of the rope had separated ere the last of them 
descended, and he had to drop so far that he dislocated 
his ankle and broke some ribs ; but his companions 
carried him, and they all escaped. 

THE DEANSTON COTTON WORKS. 

The influence of this extensive establishment is very percep- 
tible in the busy and populous character of the neighbourhood, the 
appearance of ease and comfort, and the many good houses, with 
their patches of pleasure-grounds. The works owe their origin 
and greatness to the abundant water-power and Richard Ark- 
wright. The establishment became the source of several great 
Glasgow fortunes — the original projectors having still more or less 
connection with it. About the beginning of this century, the chief 
owner was a Yorkshire quaker, with the peculiar name of Floun- 
ders. The works have always been celebrated for immediately 
embodjnng every new improvement in manufacture or organization. 

The last conspicuous person connected with the place was Mr. 
Smith — a name well known in the scientific and practical 
world, when its owner is spoken of as Smith of Deanston. 
Besides the organizations connected with the Deanston Works 
and their machinery, the late projects about drainage, irriga- 
tion, the providing cities with pure water, and the disposal of their 
impurities for the fructification of the soil, have all owed some- 
thing to his suggestive mind. But " the Deanston sy.stem of

draining," generally called " thorough draining," which has done 
so much to alter the face of agricultural Scotland, was his in- 
vention. It consists of applying to agricultural land, not merely 
local drainage where it seems needed, but a general system 
throughout for the efiFective removal of the surplus waters. 

(9) DouNE Lodge, formerly called Cambus Wal- 
lace (the Earl of Murray), to whom, Doune Castle now 
belongs. It is assuming, through recent operations, a 
very park-like appearance, with its lodges and extensive 
oflBces, crowned by a bran new steeple, which makes 
people ask if it is the parish church. 

(10^) Lankick Castle (Andrew Jardine, Esq.), 
on the opposite side of the river, an old possession of 
the MacGregors within the low coimtry. 

(13^) Cambusmore (Miss Buchanan), on the left, 
where Sir Walter Scott lived in youth, and whence he 
wandered beyond the Highland line into those scenes 
which he said became indelibly imprinted in his recol- 
lection, and which perhaps he little thought he was 
indelibly to impress on the minds of so large a portion 
of the human race. 

Gradually we find the valleys getting narrower — 
the river more rough and noisy — the outlines of the 
hills nearer — and everything far and near assuming a 
rougher aspect. (14) A bridge crosses the wild Kelty, 
which further up makes the waterfall of Bracklin. The 
bridge, though old, has a wide span, for the Kelty is a 
formidable stream, apt to swell into a rage at a moment's 
warning, and become a very troublesome passenger be- 
neath a narrow arch. The tourist in the Highlands will 
generally observe the peculiar expansive character of the 
arches over the torrents, as well as the narrowness of 
the parapets — the design being to afford a free opening 
to the streato, and obviate a broad resisting mass should 
it overflow. From the western parapet of Kelty bridge 
will be found hanging some mysterious chains. But 



46 , CALLANDER. 

the tourist is not to suppose that they are, as they 
might seem to an imaginative eye, some remnant of an 
instrument of Highland punishment. It will be sufS- 
cient to believe that a grating had some time or other 
been attached to them to keep the cattle from passing 
along the stream under the bridge, and that one day, 
as might have been expected, the Kelty in its wild frolics 
had carried it off. 

(loi) CALLANDER, 

[/n»j;— M'Gregor's Dreadnought.] 

A considerable village, stretching for some distance 
along either side of the road. The rough conglo- 
merate, of which it is chiefly built, gives its houses a 
very rugged appearance ; but a method has been found 
by bands of smooth sandstone to give the rougher ma- 
terial an ornamental character as rustic work. Callan- 
der is a mongrel sort of village, neither Highland nor 
lowland — some of the dirt and laziness it has of the 
former, and some of the hard stony and slaty comfort 
of the latter. Neither kind is like the English village, 
nestling among its trees and woodbine. The High- 
lander is not seen in his native condition at Callander, 
where partly the village is occupied by retired members 
of the farmer families in the neighbourhood, partly 
by the shopkeepers or " merchants " who supply the / 
agricultural population for some miles round; but 
mainly it is at the service of tourists. They are the 
main market of the district ; and all things are arranged, 
so far as national habits will permit, for their accommo- 
dation and gratification. If the stranger had been de- 
sirous of seeing a genuine Highland village, we would 
have recommended him to step a mile onward to Kil- 
mahog ; but that has undergone a great change, like its 
neighbours, towards stony and unpicturesque looking 



CALLANDER VICINITY. 47 

respectability. We remember it of old when the huts 
were like so many lumps of turf lying in the mud. 
Their structure was turf, built up, or inclosed in wicker 
ware ; the smoke curled out of a hole, as if the mass 
were a heap of peats undergoing spontaneous combus- 
tion ; and, as Andrew Fairservice said of the Clachan 
of Aberfoyle, which also is changed, you might know 
that you had reached it by the horses going through the 
roofs. Wicker ware or wattle was much used for edi- 
fices in the Highlands. The tourist will see a modern 
specimen in a fence along the Lubnaig about three miles 
beyond Callander, and in the village of Strathire it is 
still in use for partitions. It is something like the Indian 
bamboo stockade. Oaken staves or stakes are placed 
upright, and the wattles are interlaced between them 
like basket-work. It made a strong though irregular 
fabric, and was used for making carts, for fences, and 
for the walls of houses, which, when so constructed, were 
called creel houses — so much for what might have beeti 
seen close to Callander but has passed away. 

As Callander is but partially Highland in the cha- 
racter of its people, so it is in its immediate scenery. The 
geological characteristics which make the sharp peaks 
and fantastic contortions of the Highland mountains have 
not yet properly begun. They belong to the mica slate 
and kindred formations, so twisted, marled, and con- 
torted, and at the same time so hard and indestructible, 
while we are still in the red sandstone formations with 
occasional igneous risings through them. Still the mural 
precipice Avest from the village is a fine bold rock, sand- 
stone though it be. The surface of the nearer hills 
mainly consists of masses of conglomerate, with its small 
boulders of porphyry, pebble, and greenstone, which, 
from their broken unequal surface and dark hue, give a 
savage roughness to the lower ranges of heights. 



48 CALLANDER — VICIMTY. 

Callander has one or two objects of immediate 
interest close by, which the tourist generally sees at 
odd hours, before he starts on any of the greater ex- 
cursions. He will find a comprehensive and active 
rivalry among the junior male population of the vil- 
lage to have the pleasure of conducting him towards 
any of the scenes which he desires to honour by his pre- 
sence. But whatever little superfluity of service may be 
offered by the gillies of Callander is mitigated and mild 
in comparison with that of other touring districts ; and 
we contemplate it with kindly recollections. 

THE FALLS OF BRACKLIN 

Are a mile and a half from Callander. The way to 
them is by a rugged path over the hill, suitable for 
pedestrians only. To the characteristics of this fall 
fair Helen had recourse to describe her suitor, Roderick 
Dhu— 

I grant him brave, 
But wild as Brackliu's thundering wave. 

It is formed by the little river Keltic — a good name 
for a Highland stream — which leaps from a considerable 
bank of red sandstone, and rumbles away in fine style 
among great masses of stone beneath. It has not the 
pretensioQ of a cataract, with a glen of its own, and a 
deliberate formal descent from its ledge of rock into a 
lower level of country. It is but a bum finding its way 
among broken ground and stones, but the breaks are 
large enough for precipices, and the stones might be 
called rocks. Its very carelessness and want of pre- 
tension to be a great feature in the landscape, has a 
striking stirring effect to one who has never seen a 
tempestuous Highland bum. Bracklin is a dangerous 
place, where one should be careful of his footing on the 



CALLAKDER VICINIXy. 49 

slippery and unprotected edges. A few years ago a 
marriage party of lowland peasants tried here some 
horse play or " daffing," as it is called ; but it came 
to a tragic end with, as far as we remember, two of 
them, who, tumbling into the broken angry waters, had 
no more chance of life than if they had dropped into 
the crater of Hecla, 

THE ROMAN CAMP. 

Scott tells us of the Teith which 

Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines 
On Bochastle the mouldering lines, 
Where Rome, the empress of the world. 
Of yore her eagle wings unfurled. 

This refers to some camp-looking mounds above the 
^-illage, but what is chiefly called " the Koman Camp" 
is in the pleasure-grounds of a pleasant mansion retired 
back from the lower part of the village. These mounds 
of earth, which have the reputation of so distingtiished 
an artificial origin, in some respects remind one of the 
procestrum at Ardoch, and have a very systematic artifi- 
cial character. But a creed is now cttrrent that these, 
and other mounds of a similar aspect close to streams, 
are not the doing of the hand of man, but the terraced 
banks throA\Ti up by the streams, or left on the retire- 
ment of the waters, like the instances already men- 
tioned. This view is confirmed by the fact that on the 
wide haugh of Callander there are several detached 
mounds of this character ; one of them, a very correct 
circular one, stands opposite to the windows of M'Gre- 
gor's inn. Upon the neighbouring eminences, however, 
will be found remnants of mounds which may safely be 
assigned as vestiges of British fortification ; at all events 
no stream could have raised its terrace banks there. 



jft CALLANDEB — VICINITY. 

A very pleasant stroll for a sunny evening may be 
taken towards the pass of Leny. Afterwards, ap- 
proached on the way to the Trosachs, Strathire and 
Lochearnhead ; but it is worthy of more than one visit, 
and the tourist to whom the Grampians are a novelty 
must be anxious to get a truly Highland view, which 
he has not yet had. He passes in about a mile the 
village of Kilmahog on the left, and the mansion of 
Leny, formerly a small house, but lately enlarged and 
beturreted, on the right. As we go on, the folds of the 
hills become more close and complex. 

CALLANDER BRIDGE, 

Which, is crossed on the way to the Trosachs, and 
stands so conspicuously on the left, is a favourite point 
for viewing them with full effect. There the vast 
mass of Benledi mounts right up in front, and nearer, 
crossing its line like the bastion of a fortress, to flank 
the approach, the comparatively lower but still lofty 
banks on the right stretch across the lower ranges of 
their more august neighbour. The whole imparts a 
powerful air of inaccessibility. The mountain ranges 
seems entirely to block the way, as if there were no 
entrance to tlie world beyond save by climbing their

The Gaelic name of Benledi is said to be the hill 
of the deity ; and it has the reputation of being as

altar for ancient heathen worship. In the statistical 
accounts it is said that down to a late period the bel- 
tane mysteries, remnants of heathen rites, and connect- 
ing themselves with the symbol of heathen worship, 
Bel or Bael, were performed on Benledi. It has a sad 
interest from a small desolate loch on its farther shoulder, 
called Loch-an-Corp, or the lake of the dead bodies, 
because a funeral party once crossing there on the ice, 
fell through and were drowned. The ascent from the 
Callander side of the hill is the most gentle and easy, 
and imless mist come on, there can be no danger, 
if the tourist is hardy enough to bear the fatigue. 
One of the chief cares is to avoid bogs, and this can be 
best accomplished by observing, when there is not hard 
stony ground, that where heath or juniper grows, there 
is generally dry footing. Patches of very pallid green, 
almost approaching to yellow, should always be avoided ; 
these mossy coverings, which look soft and enticing 
as velvet, often cover treacherous hidden springs. Black 
peaty ground has also to be avoided, unless a dry sum- 
mer has hardened it ; and the eye should become fami- 
liar with the wild hyacinths, the cotton gi'ass, and the 
other scanty herbage which infiicates not only a damp 
footing, but a bewildering interruption to the journey, 
sometimes danger. There may be much danger to 
the unguided wanderer if he do not look well to the 
ground he is going over, or if he is prevented from 
seeing it by mist. &gt; There are rough precipices on 
the eastern side, towards Loch Lubnaig, and still 
more formidable rocks on the northern spurs of the 
mountain, to which, if he be not careful, he may 
chance to stray. Among hills it is worth remember- 
ing that the edge of a rapid stream is generally dry, 
and there is this advantage, if one has lost his reckon- 
ing, that by following a stream one is sure of getting

gradually upwards or downwards as the case may 
be. A stream descending the east side of Benledi, 
towards Loch Lubnaig, may be followed by a good 
scrambler among rocks. They are here piled in gro- 
tesque variety, so as beneath to look like a feudal castle, 
but one may find a way through them with a little care 
and attention.

Where the Lubnaig meets the stream from the

by which the Highlands are accessible from the low- 
lands of Perthshire." Here the rocky banks approach 
closer to each other, making, indeed, in their lower 
range, a barrier across the valley through which the 
liubnaig, notwithstanding the liquid melody of its name, 
breaks in harsh thunders, tumbling from ledge to ledge, 
sweeping round rocks, and eddying in dark inky pools. 
It is overshadowed by trees, which give the partial 
glances of the turbulent stream a certain mysterious 
awe. The scenery in this district has been celebrated 
by the illustrious pen in the Lady of the Lake. It was 
up the pass of Leny that the cross of fire was carried 
by young Angus of Duncraggan. 



LOCH LUBNAIG. 53 

Benledi saw the Cross of Fire: 

It glanced like lightning up Strathire; 

O'er hill and dale the summons flew, 

Nor rest, nor pause young Angus knew; 

The tear that gathered in his eye 

He left the mountain breeze to dry ; 

Until, where Teith's young waters roll, 

Betwixt him and a wooded knoll, 

That graced the sable strath with green, 

The chapel of St. Bride was seen. 

Here the cross is delivered to Norman of Armaudave, 
who starts off with it ah^ng the shores of Loch Lubnaig, 
and away toward the distant district of Balquhidder. 
(2^) The chapel of St. Bride stands on the left on a 
small romantic knoll, between the opening of the Pass 
of Leny and Loch Lubnaig. 

After penetrating the Pass of Leny, the first great 
feature in the landscape is 

(3^) LOCH LUBNAIG, 

Skirted by the road, passing under umbrageous woods 
of birch, hazel, and pine. It accompanies the road for 
about five miles, and, after Loch Catrine, might be pro- 
nounced as lovely a lake as could be looked on. Its 
features are, however, quite peculiar. Its banks are 
soft and gentle where they immediately touch the water; 
but the dark rocks of Benledi press close upon the banks, 
so as to form a raling feature in the general scenery, 
and bestow on it features of massive grandeur. In a still 
evening, when the sun just peeps over the brow of the 
hill, gilding the eastern side of the lake, the contrast 
between the bright smooth water, imdisturbed save by 
the bubbling leap of the trout, or perhaps the splash of 
a salmon, and the dark boundary of rocks, thrown into 
shadow by the retiring day, make as fine an alternation 
of the soft and the rugged as can well be seen. It is 
thus described in the opening scene of the Legend of 



54 CALLANDER TO BALQUHIDDER. 

Montrose : — " Their course had been, for some time, 
along the banks of a lake, whose deep waters reflected 
the crimson beams of the western sun. The broken 
path, which they pursued with some difficulty, was in 
some pkices shaded by ancient birches and oak-trees, 
and in others overhung by fragments of huge rock. 
Elsewhere, the hill, which formed the northern side 
of this beautiful sheet of water, arose in steep, but less 
precipitous acclivity, and was arrayed in heath of the 
darkest purple." 

(5) Ardhullary house, on the right, was the dwelling- 
place of James Bruce the Abyssinian traveller, who 
retired to this solitude from the sneers of a sceptical 
world. This was a singular end for such a life. 
After narrowly escaping from the murderous effects of 
the treacherous Abyssinian Naybe — fleeing once and 
again for his life before wild beasts, and men nearly 
as wild — defying a murderous marauder chief in his own 
fortalice — mixing as a commander in the native wars — 
catching the deadly disease of the tropics, and being 
worn to such a skeleton that his best friends did not 
know him — after having been half buried in simooms 
of burning dust, reaching the sources of the Nile in 
spite of native opposition, and eating steaks out of liv- 
ing cows — behold, when handing a lady down stairs 
after dinner, he slips, tumbles, and is killed. The hero 
of a hundred dangers had grown fat and pursy. We 
are bound to say that we believe the event did not 
happen at Ardhullary, but at Kinnaird, in the parish 
of Tarbert, in Stirlingshire.

deed, from what it was some twenty years ago, what- 
ever appearance it may have had when the fiery cross 

glanced like lightning up Stratliire. 

At the eleventh mile we are at the comfortable- 
looking decent inn of 

king's house. 

Why it has that name we know not ; but it is to be 
found in the old maps long anterior to touring and the 
present edifice. It is not to be confounded with the 
ancient inn bearing the same name near Glencoe.

king's house to balquhidder and 

ROB ROY's country. 

(11|^) Balquhidder, close by Lechanscreaidan, if the 
tourist can charge his memory with such a name. 
Here, in the old grave-yard, close behind the school- 
house, on the right hand side of the road, may be seen 
what is called 

ROB ROy's grave. 

There is a handsome slab stone, with armorial bear- 
ings, having the character of a tombstone of that age, 
raised over a son who predeceased the great freebooter. 
What is called Rob Eoy's grave-stone is a monument 
of totally different character. A figure is engraved, 
rather than sculptured, on one part, and a sword occu- 
pies another division. These representations, and some 
carvings like mystic knots, to be found on the ancient 
sculptured stones of Scotland, show this monument to 
be of considerable antiquity. It is not often, certainly, 
that tradition makes things more modern than they are. 



d6 CALLANDER TO BALQUHIDDER, ETC. 

Yet the antiquary will probably assign this stone to a 
period centuries before Eob Roy's birth — a circumstance 
which by no means militates against his having been 
buried in this churchyard, or against this stone having 
been placed over him, since it is far too old to have 
belonged as an ancestral monument to any family. 
Another stone with the ancient crossed sword sculp- 
tured on it, as the symbol alike of the warlike pursuit 
of the departed, and the emblem of meek endurance, 
in which he trusted for acceptance, lying beside Eob 
Koy's tomb, is evidently of equally great age. An 
ancient font, entirely undecorated, and of the most 
primitive form, may belong to the same period. It 
was at the old church of Balquhidder that the M'Gre- 
gors gathered round the amputated head of the king's 
deer-keeper, vowing to stand by the murderers, and it 
is likely enough that the venerable font may have wit- 
nessed the solemn ceremony. Though Balquhidder is 
thus intimately connected with the M'Gregors, the 
burial place of their gi-eat men was, as is well known, 
in Inch Cailliach, an Island of Loch Lomond. 

Balquhidder was the centre of Rob Roy's opera- 
tions, but it is a general mistake to suppose that Rob 
was a chief, or even, properly speaking, a gentleman 
of the clan. The chiefs of clans before his day had 
become ashamed of the practice of foraying, which the 
language of the law and of society classed with common 
pilfering. Perhaps they were not always anxious to 
suppress its practice among their clansmen, but they 
looked upon it as decidedly low. Rob was, by profes- 
sion, a highland farmer and drover or cattle-dealer. 

He thought, to be sure, that he had good blootl in his veins, as 
what Highlander does not? — and boasted of a connection M'ith 
Oarapbell of Glenlyon ; but he had no pretensions to rank above 
the peasantry. As Bailie Nicol Jarvie says, when Osbaldistone 



ROB ROY S COUNTRY. ,'it 

asks if his connection is one of the Highland potentates — " Na, 
na ; he's nane o' your great grandees o' chiefs, as they ca' them, 
neither — though he is weel born, and lineally descended frae auld 
(xlen Strae." Yet, for the sake of the romance, there is no doubt 
that Scott, in the novel, makes him act somewhat like a chief. 
His character was better personified in the Highland robber, 
Donald Bean Lean, who figures in AVaverley, than in the novel 
called after his name ; and perhaps Sir Walter, having drawn so 
much upon his original and true character for the one novel, 
found it necessary to vary the shades and touches in the other. 
The origin of all Eob's errors was the same vulgar cause 
that makes waifs and strays in society in the present day — mis- 
managed and unfortunate speculations, dishonoured bills, and 
bankruptcy. In modem days, such a person would require to 
turn to some sort of very humble drudgery, or go to the workhouse. 
In Rob's time, contemporary with the palmy days of highway 
robbery in England, there were more resources for men of spirit. 
The Englishman took to the highway, the Highlander "took to 
the brae," and gathering all the scamps of the district about him, 
forayed or levied black mail. The condition into which his clan 
had been forced by the harsh laws directed against them favoured 
his projects. Other clans had their chiefs, who represented them, 
and were responsible for their good behaviour. But the M'Gre- 
gors were proscribed, and could not ostensibly unite themselves 
with any chief. To be chiefless was a great calamity in the 
Highlands. To say, '■ Name your chief," was the most insulting 
taunt which could be thrown out against a man who had the mis- 
fortune to have none. The men so situated were called broken 
men, and were always the most ready to be employed in the de- 
signs of an unscrupulous and clever leader. 

It was thus that Rob, from a bankmjit cattle-drover, saw him- 
self metamorphosed into a captain of banditti. His conduct partook 
of his twofold nature ; for he was not sanguinary as one brought 
up to the dirk might have been, nor was he, to say the truth, so 
magnanimously courageous as we arc apt to suppose him. Pro- 
bably he wanted not actual physical courage when put to it, but 
there was nothing ennobling in his cause or pursuits to call it 
forth, and he generally evaded danger when he could. As to po- 
litical matters, when people on the one side were professing to 
stand by the Revolution settlement and the Protestant religion, 
and on the other the Jacobite chiefs were devoting them- 
selves to the cause of their exiled master, Rob displayed a 
philosophical impartiality, and served any party that paid him 
best, or allowed him the fairest opportunities of lifting cattle. In 
the '15, he professed to take the Jacobite side, but he was all 
along in the pay of the Duke of Argyle for the Hanover interest : 
and, when he was ordered to lay on at Sheriflf-muir, knowing that 



58 CALLANDER TO BALQUmDDEB, ETC. 

it would be contrary to his paction to take a part, he said if ther 
could not gain the battle without him, they could not do it with 
him, and there was no necessity that he should trouble himself. 

Such was Rob, by whose grave, to which we de- 
dicate this eloge, Wordsworth uttered those reflections, 
certainly more beautiful than true, which made the 
Highland freebooter, like an ethical philosopher, analyse 
the elements of society, and find that its organization, 
under the existing social system, is utterly false, and 
that he, Eob, must take the machine to pieces, and 
reconstruct it in a simpler fashion — 

" Yet was Rob Roy as wise as brave, 
Forgive me if the phrase be strong ; 
A poet worthy of Rob Roy 
Must scorn a timid song. 

" Say then that he was wise as brave, 
As wise in thought as bold in deed ; 
For in the principles of things 
Se sought his moral creed. 

" Said generous Rob — ' What need of books ? 
Bum all the statutes and their shelves ; 
They stir us up a^inst our kind, 
Ajad worse, against ourselves.' " 

But Rob was not entirely destitute of some qualifications which 
recommended him to popular fame. His evasions of the law — his 
capture of persons so unpopular as the Duke of Montrose's factor 
— his seizures of cattle from the Lowland lairds, who were 
all deemed the natural enemies of the Highlander — were held to 
be very commendatory deeds ; but, desiring popularity, he ap- 
pears to have done acts of kindness and generosity to poor people, 
especially any who were connected with his own band, and thus 
he carried a reputation with other popular freebooters, of plunder- 
ing the rich of their superfluities, to eke out the scanty store of 
the poor. 

His sons, whose probable fate, when thrown on the world, 
with all their unhappy auspices, is so affectingly alluded to in the 
novel, appear to have been far worse men than Rob. The whole 
tribe had a feud — chiefly nursed and reared by Rob's sanguinary 
wife — with a body of M'Larcns, who had obtained a farm called 



BALQUHIDDER ROB ROY. 59 

Invementy, in those Braes of Balquhidder which the M'Gregors 
deemed peculiarly their own, and where they had squatted, from 
time immemorial, without dreaming of rent. Rob had come to terms 
with the strangers, as one great power treats with another ; but 
the more revengeful sons still nourished malice, and one of them, 
Robin Oig, walking up to Invementy with a lon^ duck gun, took 
aim at the head of the family as he was ploughing a field, and 
mortally wounded him. If the tourist wishes to know the place 
where this characteristic tragedy happened, he will find the 
grounds once occupied by the croft or farm of Invementy just 
above the small Loch Dhuine, on the south side of the stream, 
where it takes a bend in the haugh. It was not to be, however, 
by the M'Gregors that the intruding family were to be driven 
forth, but by a totally diiFerent power, and the history of their de- 
parture is eminently curious and interesting. A change in the 
condition of the estates, when they were to be converted into 
sheep farms, led to the ejection of the M'Larens. The function 
fell, as law-agent, to Mr. Scott, a highly- respectable practitioner 
in Edinburgh. Though in the last quarter of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, it appears that officers of the law, could not venture, 
unprotected, into so remote and lawless a district, and a party of 
soldiers was sent up to see the ejection executed. They were ac- 
companied by a young gentleman from the office to report back 
that all was properly performed, and this young gentleman was 
the future Sir Walter Scott, who thus, going as an attorney's 
clerk, to serve a writ of ejectment, got the first glimpse of the 
scenery and manners which he worked into the Lady of the Lake, 
Waverley, and Rob Roy. 

Balquhidder was one of the scenes of an outrage by Rob 
Roy's sons — one of the last of the kind perpetrated in the High- 
lands, for it occurred so lately as the year 1752. Seeing that 
money was becoming the source of all power, they thought it 
would be a good thing to get possession of an heiress, and induce 
her to marry one or other of them — no matter which. They fixed 
their eyes on a young widow, named Key, who lived in the old 
mansion of Edinbellie, near the pass of Aberfoyle, and very con- 
venient for immediate removal within the Highland line. Col- 
lecting such remnants of their father's freebooting band as 
remained unhanged, they came by sui"prise on the old mansion 
and carried ofl" their victim, doubled over, and tied on a horse's 
back. Sir Walter Scott says they were seen by many people, 
who dared not, however, attempt a rescue, and " among others 
who saw them was that classical and accomplished scholar, the 
late Professor William Richardson of Glasgow, who used to 
describe as a terrible dream their violent and noisy entrance into 
the house where he was then residing. The Highlanders filled 



6© CALLANDER TO BALQUHIDDER. 

the little kitchen, brandishing their arms, demanding what they 
pleased, and receiving whatever they demanded. James Mohr, 
he said, was a tall, stern, and soldier-like man. Robin Oig 
looked more gentle — ^lark and yet ragged in complexion — a good 
looking young savage. Their victim was so dishevelled in her 
dress, and forlorn in her appearance and demeanour, that he could 
hardly tell whether she was alive or dead." 

Robin was selected as the bridegroom, his brother James 
holding the bride while a clergyman of some kind was got to per- 
form the marriage ceremony. It does not appear that the Estab- 
lished clerg^•man would have gone quite so far in assisting the 
outrage : but, under the influence of the lawless set he was 
among, he was compelled to give it his countenance. The bride 
and bridegroom came formally to the church of Balquhidder, where 
the clergyman received them as married persons of his flock, the 
poor woman not daring to say nay. This outrage aroused the 
latent power of the law. Balquhidder was occupied by troops. 
It was impossible any longer to put the civil power at active de- 
fiance, and the brothers attempted to make out that the widow 
had consented to be run away with, and was legally married. 
She died while the discussion went on. Robin the bridegroom 
was hanged, while his brother, supposed to be the more guilty, 
escaped, and led a vagabond life in France. 

Such are the scenes to which the Braes of Balqu- 
hidder were witnesses a century ago. Nothing can be 
more in contrast with the placid beauty of the solitary 
glen and its sweet lakes, now that lawless man no 
more pollutes them with his presence. Penetrating the 
wilderness above the hamlet called the Kirktown of 
Balquhidder, we pass but two farm-houses in the whole 
strath — Craigrie by the side of Loch Voil, and Inver- 
lochlairg, several miles up, at the foot of the higher 
braes. 

(12) LOCII VOIL 

Alone is three and a half miles long ; but if we add 
to it the small Loch Dhuine, separated from its upper 
part by a broad patch of haugh, which narrows the 
lake to a stream, the whole makes a walk of about 
five miles. It is a beautiful lake, fringed, in many 



LOCH VOIL. 61 

places with trees like Loch Lubnaig ; but few places 
even in Scotland have snch an air of solitude and re- 
moteness from the haunts of men. The feeling of lone- 
liness is even increased when we leave the lochs and 
enter the level haugh above, which in some ancient 
day had formed part of the bed of a greater expanse of 
inland water. "What almost tends to increase this feel- 
ing of loneliness is the alluvial rich-looking character 
of the haugh, and the beautiful soft green pasture which 
cushions the braes or lower ranges of the hills ; it looks 
as if man had uses for the spot, and must have once 
frequented it. The feeling possibly is suggested by the 
knowledge that the now deserted valley swarmed at 
one time with the predatory race of whom we possess 
such strange legends ; and truly we have no difficulty 
in seeing the relics of their existence in the grassy 
mounds which cover the ruins of old cottages, and in 
the decaying walls which show later abandonment. 
May we say, as the American poet says of the Indians, 

A noble race, but they are gone, 
With their old forests wide and deep ; 
And we have fed our flocks upon 
Hills where their generations sleep. 

The tourist probably has not fed his flocks upon the 
hills ; but we shall warrant that he must have eaten the 
mutton thereof. The Braes of Balquhidder are re- 
nowned for that commodity, as the tourist will easily 
infer from the beautiful green pastures, even if he do 
not see the interesting animals themselves. This green- 
ness is very remarkable, especially in contrast with the 
bleak, dark, heathery coating of the other sides of the 
hills. It does not seem to arise from geological forma- 
tion, for all consist of the same mica slate and its con- 
geners ; and the clergyman of the parish says, in the 
statistical account, that it is a new feature, for of old 



62 CALLANDEE TO BALQUraDDER. 

the Braes were as brown as their neighbours. Is it 
owing to persevering sheep feeding ? 

Here, as well as in Glencroe and other valleys with 
good lower stretches of pastoral grass, one may see the 
very beautiful sight, commemorated by an old poet, of 
the sheep "reding in raw" or row. In the rugged 
upper reaches of the Braes, they can only find narrow 
paths, to pass from ledge to ledge of grass ; and, as they 
are driven to the lower valleys at night, they may be seen 
far up in long strings of minute white dots along the 
faces of the dusky rocks. They might be compared to 
strings of seed pearls on the neck of an African beauty, 
if one wished to be poetical. 

These rocks grow higher and more rugged as the 
adventurous pedestrian ascends the glen. Great gullies 
open here and there on the right, affording glimpses of 
the mountain masses of Ben More, Stobinain, and Meal 
Naughtan. If he has proceeded so far that he does not 
desire to return to King's House, the pedestrian may 
pass by one of the water-sheds into another strath ; but 
it will be well that he consider which he adopts, as 
there are two things materially different — finding your- 
self at eve in a valley with a comfortable inn, and 
finding yourself at the same time in a valley without a 
human habitation. By striking to the northward near 
Ben Charra, you may reach Glengyle and the head of 
lioch Catrine. By penetrating any of the formidable 
gullies between the vast crags on the other side, one 
may penetrate to Glen Dochart, on the great north 
road to Fort- William. The nearest way, perhaps, of 
completing the expedition, will be to go due west, strike 
Glen Falloch, and repair to the comfortable inn at In- 
verarnan. To accomplish this, the pedestrian, keeping 
a small lake on his left, crosses part of the shoulder of 
Ben Ghana, to avoid the morasses of the water-shed ; 



BRAES OF BALQUHIDDER. 63 

and, when he finds the streams descend almost due west 
down very steep and rocky hills, he descends with it. 
If he have found the proper direction, he will see the 
wild twisted crags of Ben Arthur to the westward, and 
will be cheered by observing beneath his feet the 
sullen dark waters of the upper reach of Loch Lomond, 
while through the openings on the left he has traced the 
graceful outlines of its Ben. From King's House to 
Glen Falloch is, however, a stiff walk, partly over very 
rough and high groiuid, of about twenty miles, and who- 
ever undertakes it should know himself competent to 
its difficulties. In the upper part, he will not even find 
a foot-path. He will be told perhaps that there is one; 
but the chances are infinity to one against his keeping 
it. He must remember too that there is no bridge on 
the Falloch. It is shallow near the inn where there are 
stepping-stones ; but, should the season be wet and the 
waters swollen, there are many chances of his not get- 
ting over to the inn so temptingly close to him after all 
his exertions — a calamity of very frequent occurrence 
to the wanderer in the Highlands. Moreover, it must 
be remembered that, a little way up the glen, the Fal- 
loch is at all times a wild stream, tumbling over rocks 
into remorseless holes.

tain boundary of fine outline on either side, and rich 
woodlands with a sprinkling of agricultural cultivation, 
and here and there a gentleman's seat. On the other

From this the tourist may go through the wild 
scenery of Glen Ogle — a narrow precipitous ravine, 
over which the rough rocks, especially those on the 
east side, arise to a great height — to Killin and Tay- 
mouth. There is a regular coach this way. 

In descending the lake, the road on the right hand 
side is to be preferred. It passes, two miles from the 
inn, the old Castle of Edinample (Marquis of Bread- 
albane), with a stream in its neighbourhood which 
forms a considerable wateifall. Lochearn is perhaps 
the most ancient in tourist chronology of the Highland 
lakes ; and, from its accessibility — perhaps also from 
its mere commonplace character — it appears to have 
been visited, admired, and sketched, when the Trosachs 
were deemed a heap of unsightly rocks, somewhere 
beyond the limits of civilisation. The fame of the Pit- 
caithley Wells, in the lower part of Stratheam, did much, 
in the day when they made the Cheltenham of Scotland, 
to bring Lochearn into repute. On the south side

ness in the Highland villages, has been discontented 
with the civilised character of those he may have seen 
near Callander, he will lose all patience when he comes 
to St. Fillans, at the lower extremity of Lochearn. 
It is altogether a show pet village, with its allotments 
and trellises of creeping flowers, and more adapted to 
the philanthropist than the searcher after the sublime 
and terrible. The spot is celebrated as the place of 
meeting of the St. Fillan's Highland Society, for the 
encouragement of athletic games. Its name is derived 
from a celebrated Scottish saint, who had a sacred 
fountain here, and another in Strath Fillan some thirty 
miles westward, on the bank of a stream pursuing its 
course to Loch Tay. Fillan was a saint of great na- 
tional importance in Scotland, since his arm bone Avas 
long kept as a relic in a silver shrine, and received 
high celebrity from having been borne by the abbot of 
Inchaffray before the victorious Scots at the battle of 
Bannockburn. 

Descending Strathearn through varied scenery of 
the more cultivated Highland character for about 5^ 
miles, we are in 

COMRIE. 

[/«» ; — Commercial.] 

This is the place so celebrated for its earthquakes ; but 
we are sorry we have no means of offering the slightest 
hint to the tourist how he could time his visit so as to 
alight on one of these interesting phenomena. 

Geologists have given no good reason for this uneasy predc- 
minance. In the neighbourhood, it is true, the sandstone forma- 
tion ends, and mica slate begins ; but that is a common enough 



66 DETOUR TO COMRIE AND CRIEFF. 

phonomehon. It is said by some that the reason why so many 
earthquakes have been recorded here and so few elsewhere, is 
merely because they have been better noted in Comrie — a view 
which has a decided tendency to turn Scottish earthquakes into 
contempt, as things which may occur without being perceptible 
to one man out of a whole population. 

Comrie has an air of the shabby genteel — a tone of 
modernness and decay, much enhanced by the fine 
names of square and crescent given to its humble rows 
of houses, in anticipation apparently of their becoming 
the centre of a great city. We believe it was in view 
at one time to endeavour to make it a great manufac- 
turing town. 

The tourist, if he have time, will not fail to visit 
a wild ravine, where there is a turbulent little stream, 
overhung by broken impending rocks, called the Devil's 
Cauldron. It is perhaps scarcely fair to inform him 
that the torrent goes by the utterly unromantic and 
nn-Highland name of the " Humble Bumble." 

Ci^LLANDER TO COMRIE BY THE DIRECT PATH. 

There is a byeroad leading directly from Callander to Comrie, 
and the lower district of Strathearn, without passing Locheam- 
head. The scenery, without possessing any celebrated feature, is 
varied and beautiful, sometimes affording lovely glens, bounded 
by great bare mount.ains, at others leading through gladed ravines, 
rich in variety of foliage and rock, and pesetrated by wild and 
beautiful streams. I^eading in the first place across the uplands 
to the east of Callander, the path strikes the glen of the rest- 
less Kelty, and ascending with it to the water-shed. There 
leaving the top of Ben Larig to the left, it descends, the waters 
leading to the basin of the Tay by Glen Grachan. Turning east- 
ward, after having held for some time a coarse almost due north, 
some hills of note are passed. Uam-Var is to the right, in the 
ascent of the Kelty. Afterwards two hills of greater size and 
ruggeduess rise to the westward — the more southerly is Stuk-a- 
Chrom, one of the most conspicuous hills in the view from Stirling 
(Jastle ; the other is the eastern Ben Voirlich — a hill which com- 
petes with Ben Lomond in grandeur of form, and is nearly as 
high. It is well worthy being ascended by the ambitious crags- 



CRIEFF. 67 

man. The Grachan joins the Artney on the left, and the pedes- 
trian descends through " lone Glenartney's hazel shade," an ex- 
pression of which he will be especially awake to the descriptive 
heauty if he tread the glen in a summer evening, when the sun is 
just disappearing behind the western hills in time to let him reach 
the inn of Comne in safety. The walk perforates the scene of the 
beginning of the hunt in the Lady of the Lake, for the party are 
supposed to have proceeded northward by the Braes of Doune, in- 
stead of going so far west as Callander ; and it is by descending 
&lt;jlenfiulas that the foremost horseman must be supposed to have 
reached the Brigg of Turk. 

At Comrie, the tourist is about 6^ miles from 

CRIEFF. 
[/«B ; — Dniininond Arms.] 

A considerable lowland town, which brings him into 
close communication with the Scottish Central E ail way. 
In the immediate vicinity are the celebrated Drummond 
Castle (Lord AVilloughby D'Eresby), the seat of the 
exiled Jacobite family of Drummond, titular Duke of 
Perth ; Ochtertyre (Sir William Keith Murray) ; Monzie 
Castle (A. Campbell, Esq.), all worthy of the tourist's 
attention. At the obscure village of Muthill, between 
two and three miles west of Crieff, there are Roman 
remains, and the ruins of a considerable Gothic church 
in the early English style.

We now start again from Callander on a detom- of 
a totally different kind, at least for a considerable part 
of its extent — by Menteith and Aberfoyle to the string 
of lakes above it parallel to Loch Catrine. There is 
something melancholy in leaving the grandeur of 
mountain scenery, especially when it is not to be 
changed for a rich agricultural country, but for the cold 
swelling moorlands which connect the Lowlands with 
the Highlands ; and the dreariness of the scenery is apt 
to be acutely felt on leaving Callander, until one gets 
thoroughly into the warm, well- wooded valley or strath 
of Menteith. 

(5^) LAKE MENTEITH. 

It will then be a rare treat to visit the Lake of 



LAKE MENTEITH. »i9 

Menteith, if the southern traveller should be getting 
s(»mewhat tired of misty mountains, rocks, and cata- 
racts. A greater contrast he could not find, were he 
suddenly to transfer himself from the mica schist 
mountains of Perthshire to the Bedford level. The 
area of the lake is an indented circle of about seven 
miles' circumference. Not deposited in the hollow of 
a rocky valley by the torrents, like the Highland lochs, 
it has oozed itself into a depression in the soft cake of 
diluvium which cushions the depression between the 
Grampians and Campsie Fells. It represents, indeed, 
a slight indentation in that which was formerly covered 
by the sea, and may be compared to a drop left 
behind, on the retirement of the mighty waters, which, 
thus isolated from the living deep, has turned fi-esh. All 
is soft and feathery about the edge of the water — rich 
woodlands, oziers, and murmuring reeds. A calm day 
should be selected for the visit, for wind or rain would 
spoil the soft and tender influence of the scene. The 
Highland hills themselves are softened and beautified 
by it ; for to give mountains, when they are at a dis- 
tance, the efiect of the awful and nigged, we must have 
fragments of mountain scenery close at hand, reminding 
us of the vast masses of which the mountain range, 
rendered small by distance, consists. It is certain that, 
were Lake Menteith in the middle of a far-stretching 
plain, it would not seem so warm and soft as nestling 
in the hollow, skirted by that distant range of moun- 
tains basking in the sunlight. In a warm summer 
evening, when the sunlight gilds the mountain 
points it is going to sink behind, and casts fragment- 
ary streaks of light through the massive trees across 
the unruffled water into the recesses of the islands, 
with their trees and rums, the efiect is the perfection 
of beautiful repose in scenery. It is completed in the 



70 CALLANDER TO ABERFOYLE, ETC. 

foreground by the village church of the Port of Menteith^ 
and the picturesqiie mausoleiun of the Grahams of 
Gartmore ; but still better, perhaps, by Bingling out 
one of the large and ancient chestnut trees which 
stretch forth their massive shades of light and tender 
green, which has restored their youthful freshness iu 
the summers of many successive centuries. 

Taking boat at the Port of Menteith, as it is called, 
you will probably first land on the island of Talla or the 
Earl. It is so thickly umbrageous as to seem almost 
entirely a vegetable concretion. One is inclined to 
wonder how it was solid enough to support the mass of 
heavy buildings, whose ruins attest their old extent. 
These ruins are of the baronial character common in 
Scotland — a strong square tower, with parasitical 
buildings around it. They possess no peculiarity to 
give them interest to the architectural student, who 
must be content, in landing on Talla, with the general 
pleasing effect of the scene. This was the feudal for- 
talice of the great Earls of Menteith. It was occupied 
down to the period of the Eevolution, when a curi- 
ous inventory of its contents throws light on the habits 
of the aristocracy of the period. The " brew-house 
chamber" was decorated with a red table-cloth and 
a " red scarlet resting chair." The warmth of this 
chamber was a commodity not to be wasted, and it 
appears that several of the bed-rooms were clustered 
round it. 

But the more interesting island is that on which 
the remains of monastic ruins, less conspicuous at a dis- 
tance, are found. It is called Inch-mahomej or the 
Isle of Rest, and more perfect seclusion cannot be con- 
ceived. Without fortifications and their warlike asso- 
ciations, the calm waters of the lake would protect the 
religious recluses from the ravages of the Highlanders, 



LAKE MENTEITH IN'CH-MAHOME. 71 

who had little more respect than the north men of old 
for the sanctity of monastic institutions. The architec- 
tural antiquary has here a fine field for inquiry. The 
architecture is the early English, or first pointed, with 
lancet windows. One of these, at the extremity of the 
choir, has the rather uncommon number of five lights, 
so close to each other as to make a near approach to 
mullioning. The full effect of this window can scarcely 
be experienced, as the lights are built up. It is evident 
that it possessed great dignity and symmetiy. In a 
chapel on the south side of the main edifice, there is a 
lancet-topped window of three lights, the centre predo- 
minating in the usual t^'pical manner. The archaeolo- 
gist will see with delight the extreme beauty of the 
western door, richly moulded and sculptured along its 
deep retiring jambs. In the choir, there are crypt, 
sedilia, a piscina, and other usual adjuncts of a mediaeval 
church. But what will most strikingly interest the 
stranger to that peaceful ruin is a reciimbent monument 
of two figures male and female, cut out of one large 
stone. The knight is in armour, and one leg is crossed 
over the other, in the manner held typical of the cru- 
sader. A triangular shield, with the checque fesse, 
shows the bearer to have been a Stewart. The arm of 
the lady is twined affectionately round his neck. The 
anatomical development of the attitude is not very ac- 
curate ; but it will be excused, in reflection on the pa- 
thetic feeling which guided the artist. While much of 
the monument has been defaced, this memorial of 
affection seems to have been respected ; and, standing 
in the evening sunshine ^vithin the ruins, surmounted by 
the green boughs of the huge chestnut trees, there must 
be little imagination in the mind to which this stony 
record of heroism and attachment of forgotten persons 
belonging to a past unknown age, does not create 



72 CALLANDER TO ABERFOYLE, ETC. 

some fanciful and pleasing thoughts. The church is 
said to have been founded by Walter Cumyng, Earl of 
Menteith, second son of William, Earl of Buchan, who 
had obtained from the crown a gift of the district of 
Badenoch. He was bom about the year 1190, and the 
style of the architecture would suit with a foundation 
soon after this date. The monastery is said to have 
been endowed at a later period. It was for monks of 
the Augustine order ; and it was dependent on the 
great house of Cambuskenneth, passing with it after the 
Kefoimation, as a temporal lordship to the Earl of Mar. 
The arms on the shield show that the recumbent tomb 
is not that of the founder, and, had it been intended 
for him, it would have been designed to mock the 
world with a falsehood, since Cumyng's wife was so 
little entitled to a commemoration of her marital affec- 
tion, that she was accused of murdering her husband. 
Walter Stewart, who married the sister of the heiress, 
afterwards obtained a grant of the estate. • 

He was a crasader in the disastrous expedition under St. 
Jjouis, called the third crusade, and fought in the national battle 
of Largs. It was probably for him that the monument was de- 
signed — one would desire to believe at all events that it was not 
for his son, who became infamous under his titular name of Men- 
teith by the betrayal of Wallace. A charter by King Robert 
Bruce in the chartulary of Montrose is dated from this monastery, 
in the year 1310. He was then in the midst of the wandering un- 
certain life which preceded his great victory. Other princes have 
from time to time visited the Isle of Rest. One to whose career 
it imparted little of its repose, passed her girlhood here. It was 
the place to which the young Princess Mary was conveyed after 
the battle of Pinkey, and the " rough wooing," as it was termed, 
of the English king for his son. Here she lived with her four 
Marys — Mary Beaton, Mary Seaton, Marj^ Livingston, and Mary 
Fleming. The place is of course traditionally connected with her, 
and a summer-house and hawthorn tree are shown near the mar- 
gin of the lake, as objects in which she took delight. The tourist 
may believe the tradition or not as he pleases. The Rev. Mr. 
M'Gregor, Stirling, in his "Introductorj- Verses to Inchmahome," 
says, — 



LAKE MENTEITH INCH-MAHOME. 73 

" My orchard's wealth, my boxwood's grace, 
Enlivening yet the sylvan place, 
Embellishing my Isle of Rest; 
Furnish'd the jocund rural ftte 
To soothe the youthful scepter'd guest. 
Each wayward thought obliterate. 
And banish all alarms." 

The ruins of the buildings subsidiary to the monas- 
tery are extensive. It is evident that after the Eefor- 
mation the whole had been so practically secularized 
that the windows of the church had been built up to 
make it the better serve as a house or fortress. The 
great size and antiquity of the chestnut trees on the 
island naturally recalls the scenes they must have wit- 
nessed there as saplings. But, in the present year 
1853, the largest, which excited the admiration and ex- 
ercised the art of Grecian Williams, lies a prostrate 
trimk, showing its age in its multitudinous rings. 

After leaving this lively lake, we are again among 
those dreary secondary uplands which shoot forth from 
the Grampians. The desolate character of the track 
before us, stretching from the Clyde to the edges of the 
Grampians, is admirably described in Rob Roy, as well 
as the impression it was calculated to produce on the 
mind of the young Englishman during his tedious ride 
towards the adventurous mountain land. Not doomed, 
like him, to find a willow wand before the door as an 
emblem that the place is tabooed, he will be glad, per- 
haps, to arrive at the respectable inn, which, \mder the 
auspices of a picture of Bailie Nicol Jarvie and his 
renowned feat, he will find a very different reception 
from what the travellers in that eventful night found in 
its predecessor. A culter of a plough, preserved with 
pious care in commemoration of that event, is apt to re- 
mind one of Horace Walpole's story of the cicerone 
who showed the sword with which Balaam smote his 
ass, and being told that Balaam did not actually smite. 



74 CALLANDER TO ABERFOYLE, ETC. 

but desired a sword that he might do so, said — " Well, 
that's the sword he wanted." 

(10) ABERFOYLE. 

[Inn : — Brewster's.] 

Aberfoyle is distant twenty-two miles from Dumbar- 
ton by Drymen, nineteen from Stirling, and five from 
the Trosachs. It is not in itself a striking spot. The 
cold bare-looking inn has a cold bare hill behind, and the 
Forth, here a small but deep stream, justifies its name of 
the Avon Dhu or black water, by its dusky, sulky, sluggish 
current. But if the tourist has not been wandering in the 
Highlands, but here approaches the mountains for the 
fii'st time, he will feel an interest in the near approach 
to the Highland line, and the symptoms of a decided 
alteration in the scenery. This spot is interesting from 
its having been the residence of the Rev. Mr, Graham, 
the minister of the parish of Deuchry, the first to draw 
attention to the scenery of the Trosachs. His little 
book of " Sketches descriptive of picturesque scenery on 
the southern confines of Perthshire, including the Tro- 
sachs, Loch Ard, &amp;c.," will still amply repay a perusal. 
An excellent road leads westward through the pass. 
At little more than a mile from the inn is the original 
Clachan, close to where the stream of the Deuchry 
joins the Forth. As to the Pass, it is not one of the 
narrow paths winding between precipices, like the 
passage through the Trosachs, but it comes to a ridge 
where the hills on either side approach very close, and 
make the spot easily defensible. It is interesting, be- 
cause, when once passed, though the elevation is not 
very high, the flat moorland scenery of the low country 
is shut out, and the valleys, with their secluded lakes 
and rugged mountains, occupy the view. The road is 
cut through the ridge, leaving a stony bank on either 



LOCH ARD, 75 

Bide. Near the Clachan will be found some works of 
an uncommon kind in this country — a manufactory of 
pyrolignious acid or vinegar from the abundant coppice 
iiround. 

(12) LOCH ARD. 

Passing first the small indented lake of lower Loch 
Ard, we reach the higher lake, about two and a half 
miles long. Its northern side is a pretty regular curve 
on a wide diameter ; but on the other side it runs into 
a long reach, where on an island there are the remains 
of a safety retreat, said to have belonged to Murdoch, 
Duke of Albany. Loch Ard possesses an echo, which, 
were it haunted as the echoes of Killarney are by fiddlers 
and buglemen, would be a decided misfortune. The 
tourist here may, however, amuse himself in peace. It 
is best found, not imder the highest of the rocks walling 
the path on the right, but under the smoothest. It is 
a deliberative echo, waiting a while and answering you 
distinctly after you have perhaps given it up. 

At the head of the lake on the northern side, the 
farm-looking house of Ledyard points the way to a 
waterfall near the road, which has obtained celebrity 
as the original of Scott's description of the favourite 
retreat of Flora Macdonald. There is here no repre- 
sentative of the perilous bridge from which Flora waved 
her handkerchief, but there is the " natural basin filled 
to the brim with water, which, when the bubbles 
of the fall subsided, v,as so exquisitely clear that, 
though it was of great depth, the eye could discern each 
pebble at the bottom." The eflFect of this fall depends 
much on the amount of water. When loaded with 
recent rain, it sweeps down the whole series of broken 
ledges overwhelming the deep pool. In its foamy tor- 
rent, it is a more terrible but less beautiful object than

in the still evenings of a dry summer. It may be men- 
tioned that, if the t()urist make inquiry at the roadside 
shop which he passes a mile -or two farther on, he may 
be directed to two falls farther up in the mountains well 
worth seeing, when the streams are swollen by rain, 
but not of great account at other times. 

From the head of Loch Ard, by crossing the hill 
to the valley of the Deuchry, the tourist may reach 
Rowardennan, either ascending Ben Lomond, or, if he 
be less ambitious, crossing a spur of the mountain. Of 
the ascent we shall speak more at length in the next 
department. This hill crossing the rocky barrier to the 
left is a conspicuous and striking object, during a great 
part of the route from Aberfoyle. From the upper end 
of Loch Ard, a winding stream leads to 

(17) LOCII CHON, 

Of the same character but not quite so extensive. The 
tourist may now turn to the left for Inversnaid on Loch 
Lomond, or to Stronaclachan Inn on Loch Catrine.

as the two are distinct. Just as the river widens into

are at (2^) Coilantogle Ford, the spot to which 
Roderick Dhu is supposed to have pledged his faith to 
convey the stranger scaithless, to the frontiers of his 
dominions — 

" Far past Clan Alpine's outmost guard." 

It was on reaching this point that he came forth with 
the demand of single combat, which the king, brave as 
he was, would rather have declined. 

" See here, all vantageless I stand, 
Armed, like thyself^ witli single brand : 
For this is Coilantogle Ford, 
And thou must keep thee with thy sword." 

(5) LOCH VENACHAR 

Is about five miles long, and a mile and a-half broad. 
On the opposite shore may be seen the woods of Dullater, 
and of Drunkie — a name of dissipated sound, which Scott 
had too much taste to introduce in his poem. Nothing 
indeed is more remarkable throughout this and his 
other poems than the skill with which he selects fine 
sounding names. Loch Venachar's glassy surface is 
broken by one lonely island, covered with trees, and 
called Inch Vroin. The scene, but for the surround- 
ing heights, is soft and verdant, like some of the 
English lakes. Scott alludes to the dank osiers fring- 
ing the swampy shallows, and alternating with heaps of 
mountain debris tossed here and there on the margin 
from the swollen torrents of the hills. At either end 
the lake imperceptibly merges into the river, of which 
it is, properly speaking, a widening. At its upper ex- 
tremity the tourist may take his choice of any particular 
spot, as that where Roderick Dhu gave a whistle, and 

" Instant, through copse and heath, arose 
Bonnets and spears and bended bows ; 



DUNCEAGGAN. 79 

On right, on left, above, below, 
Sprung up at once the lurking foe ; 
From shingles grej their lances start, 
The bracken bush sends forth the dart." 

The great wizard has been accused, with some justice, of 
having used his wand to create a scene too theatrical for the 
mountains — in fact, a scene which the theatre alone can realise. 
If it had been consistent with the method of Highland warfare to 
be ready at once in any single spot for such a display — which it 
was not, the mountain scenery is on too large a scale to have 

fiven it so startling and conspicuous an effect as the poet describes, 
'o have produced ' Ben Ledi's li\-ing side ' would have required 
the host of Xerxes rather than the gathering of a single clan. 
But, if it'.be somewhat theatrical, there can be but one opinion t&gt;n 
the stiiTing description of the incident, and there is no harm in 
the tourist trying his own whistling powers, and imagining the 
whole scene to himself 

(5^) Lanrick Mead. The flat meadow at the head 
of the loch is the gathering ground of the Clan Alpine, 
and well suited for the purpose. 

(6) DUNCRAGGAX AKD NEW TROSACH's INN, 

A spot connected also with the gathering. Of old it 
was a truly Highland clachan, where one house, accus- 
tomed to the visits of belated tourists, had gradually 
got into a systematic way of accommodating them. 

This was the stage, it will be remembered, of the first 
exhausted bearer of the fiery cross, who is now to give 
it up to the next bearer. 

" Duncraggan's huts appear at last, 
And peep, like moss-grown rocks, half seen. 
Half hidden in the copse so green ; 
There mayst thou rest, thy labour done, 
Their lord shall speed the signal on." 

But, as will be remembered, the henchman bearing 
the warlike symbol only arrives to see the funeral of 
the man who should have relieved him. The course of 



80 CALLANDER TO LOCH CATRINE. 

the messenger of war, however, must not be stopped by 
such a trifle, and the son, taken from the bier, assumes 
his father's sword and dirk, and speeds onwards. The 
incident is finely calculated to bring out the behests of 
war in a savage country — ^behests to which everything 
else must bow. The next incident tending to the same 
social development is the interruption of the bridal 
party. The bereaved son must let the tear be dried in 
his eye as he hurries on — the bridegroom must part 
with his bride on the spot where they have been 
united. 

Of the geographical progress of the message, Scott 
himself gives this account in his notes : — 

"The first stage of the Fiery Cross is to Duncraggan, a place 
near the Brigg of Turk, where a short stream divides Loch Ach- 
ray from Loch Venachar. From thence, it passes towards Cal- 
lander, and then, turning to the left up the pass of Leny, is 
consigned to Norman at the chapel of Saint Bride, which stood on 
a small and romantic knoll in the middle of the valley, called 
Strathire. Tombea, and Arnandave or Ardmandave, are names 
of places in the vicinity. The alarm is then supposed to pass 
along the lake of Lubnaig, and through the various glens in the 
distnct of Balquhidder, including the neighbouring tracts of Glen- 
finlas and Strathgartney." 

The fiery cross was no mere creation of the poet's fancy. 
Though there are many attributes fictitiously applied to the 
Highlanders, this was a real one, and the adaptation of it shows 
the great novelist's marvellous capacity for seizing whatever was 
true and real, and, at the same time, striking and picturesque. 
The symbol was sometimes called the fiery cross — sometimes the 
crossterie or crossteric. It was made, as Scott has described, by 
tying two pieces of wood into a cross, burning the ends, and ex- 
tinguishing them in the blood of an animal. This is said to 
be symbolic of the fire and sword with which those who failed to 
obey the summons were to be visited ; but it is not unlikely that 
the ceremony was a remnant of some ancient heathen sacrificial 
superstition. It was the method in which the chief assembled 
his Highland followers for war and for other purposes. It was 
considered the strongest form of invocation, and when other and 
feebler appeals had failed, this was sometimes had recourse to. 
It was repeatedly emploj'ed in "the '45," but probably never since 
that event. 



BRIGG OF TURK. «1 

nius, according to the rapid narrative of the poem, 

" Fast as the fatal symbol flies, 
In arms the huts and hamlets rise : 
From winding glen — from upland brown, 
Thej pour'd each hardy tenant &lt;lown." 

(6f ) BRIGG OF TURK. 

Soon after leaving Loch Achray, \\ here a mountain 
stream tumbles into the river between the lakes, wt- 
come to the lonely old-fashioned bridge with the pecu- 
liar name, now so renowned from the simple couplet — 

" And, when the Brigg of Turk was won. 
The headmost horseman rode alone." 

The spot, lonely enough in the days when Scott 
wandered past it, has been well peopled by his magic 
pen. In the thick of the touring season, a whole mob 
sometimes crosses the narrow bridge. 

The stream spanned by the Brigg of Turk, as well 
.'IS the valley of Glenfinlas, through which it passes, ha\e 
their own attractions. A short way up is the cataract — 

'■ Whose waters their wild tumult toss 
Adown the black and craggy boss 
Of that huge cliff, whose ample verge- 
Tradition calls the Hero's Targe 
Couch'd on a shelve beneath its brink. 
Close where the thundering torrents sink, 
Rocking beneath their headlong sway, 
And drizzled by the ceaseless spraj'. 
Midst groan of rock and roar of stream, 
The wizard waits prophetic dream." 

The author tells that, by tradition, an outlaw was 
said to have hidden himself under the Targe, whence 
his food was let down to him, while he supplied him- 
self with water bv a bucket from the stream beneath as

from a draw-well. If the tourist do not make a special 
pilgrimage to the glen through which the stream passes, 
he will look towards its dark opening with interest as 
the scene of the strange wild tale of " Glenfinlas." Two 
hunters of the deer take up their abode in a lonely 
bothy, and, in their revelry at night, one of them speaks 
lightly of beguiling 

" The fairest of our mountain maids, 
. The daughters of the proud Glengyle." 

His companion, who has the fatal gift of the seer, 
solemnly checks him with tragic predictions, bi;t the 
other grows wilder and more reckless, and sets oflF with 
his hounds to keep tryst with one of the damsels. The 
prophetic friend stays alone. The dogs return one by 
one, bearing the impress of supernatural horror. After 
them glides in a female figure, " An huntress maid in 
beauty bright, all dripping wet her robes of green." 
She tells the surly seer that 

" Wliere wild Loch Catiine pours her tide, 
Blue dark and deep round many an isle, 
Our father's towers o'erhang her side, 
The castle of the proud Glengyle." 

But the seer is armed against all her falsehoods 
and blandishments, and tells her — 

" Not thin^, a race of mortal blood, 
Nor old Glengyle's pretended line ; 
Thy dame, the lady of the flood ; 
Thy sire, the monarch of the mine." 

Thereupon the true fiend is developed in a series 
of horrors. Fortifying himself with orisons, the seer 
is imtoiiched, but the torn remains of his unfortunate 
companion fall around him in mangled limbs and a 
shower of blood. 



LOCH ACHKAY. 83 

The next feature after Brigg of Turk is the widening 
of the river again into 

(7) LOCH ACHRAY. 

This gradual widening is common to the lake and river 
scenery of other countries, where it is sometimes diflScult 
to separate lake from river, as in the Shannon in Ireland. 
But it is uncommon in Scotland, where, from the rocky 
character of the scenery, the feeders generally toss them- 
selves with great decision into the lake, and the river 
rushes as distinctly out at some narrow opening. The 
immediate scenery still preserves its gentle character. 

" The rocks — the bosky thickets sleep, 
So stilly in thy bosom deep ; 
The lark's blithe carol from the cloud, 
Seems for the scene too gaily loud." 

At its head, however, the mountain boundary has been 
visible to the tourists, ever nearing ; and the greedy 
eye of awakening curiosity attempts to penetrate into 
the mysteries of the renowned Trosachs. To prepare 
him duly, however, for the feast of the eye and the mind, 
the hospitable towers of a magnificent hotel attract his 
attention ; and there, we have no doubt, he will meet 
a hearty reception, unless the house be full. Nor will 
the landlord, we venture to say, insist on the unreason- 
able demand that, as an open sesame, the Saxon traveller 
should pronounce the name of the Inn. 

(8) ARDCHEANOCIIROCHAN INN. 

When you awaken in the morning, finding yourself in 
a sort of a casemate of a tower, with a loop-holed window, 
do not take any sitdden alarm that you are transmuted 
into Koderick Dhu, and transferred to a dungeon in 
Stirling Castle. Here, as elsewhere around, is evi-

dence of locomotive progress. A few years ago, what 
is now the embattled castle was a humble wayside 
looking inn, where the few visitors of Loch Catrine, 
who did not get back to Callander, managed to spend 
the night much crowded together. There are people 
alive, however, not very old, who remember that, when 
the first rush of visitors was made by the publication of 
the Lady of the Lake, the farmer, who had a cottage at 
the place with the long name, somewhat astonished 
but not displeased that the fashionable world should all 
at once take possession of his dwelling, converted it 
into a public-house, and from a public-house to an inn. 
Going somewhat farther back still, in the old statistical 
account, it is mentioned how the few tourists, going out 
of the beaten track who took this direction, were some- 
times hospitably relieved by the pristine kindness of the 
cottager. 

(8^) THE TUOSACHS. 

" The western waves of ebbing day 
Roll'd o'er the glen their level way ; 
Each purple peak, each flinty spire, 
Was bathed in floods of living fire. 
But not a setting gleam could glow 
Within the dark ravines below, 
Where twined the path in shadow hid, 
Round many a rocky pyramid. 
Shooting abruptly from the dell 
Its thunder-splinter'd pinnacle ; 
Round many an insulated mass, 
The native bulwarks of the pass, 
Huge as the tower which builders vain 
Presumptuous piled on Shinar's plain. 
The rocky summits, split and rent, 
Formed turret, dome, or battlement, 
Or seem'd fantastically set 
With cupola or minaret. 
Wild crests as pagod ever deck'd, 
Or mosque of Eastern architect. 
Nor were these earth-born castles bare. 
Nor lack'd they many a banner fair ; 



THE TR0SACH3. 85 

For, from their shiver'd brows display'd, 
Far o'er the unfathomable glade, 
All twinkling with the dewdrops sheen, 
The briar-rose fell in streamers green, 
And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes, 
Waved in the west-wind's summer sighs. 

This is certainly a brilliant description — among the 
finest referable to scenery that exists in any language ; 
and yet it is a description rather whetting the appetite 
to see than appeasing it by affording a full impressiori 
of the object. In fact, to describe the Trosachs, so as 
to let one understand what they are, is, we believe, 
not in mortal power, and they must be seen to be ap- 
preciated. The Trosachs are a chaos, clothed in the 
rich beauty of endlessly varied and diffused vegetation. 
This maze of broken hills owes its multitudinousness of 
form to the tough contorted character of the mica slate, 
the twistings and eccentricities of which seem to have 
been here tried to their utmost. The first natural feel- 
ing of the passenger is — what a pass for defence — how 
completely could a hostile army be here exterminated 
unless it took possession of the heights. But of old a 
hostile army could hardly have got into the defile to be 
destroyed, it was accessible only by a ladder, such as 
the alpine tourist may remember, near the baths of 
Leuk. Still the Trosachs are in some measure provok- 
ingly inaccessible. Peeps are obtained into multitudi- 
nous recesses where we might see — who shall say what '? 
but the thing is impracticable. We would suppose, 
however, that were there now need for it, the guides 
and other Highland neighbours must know one or two 
rare hiding places in the interstices. It is easy to 
believe how serviceable this scattered heap of rocks 
must have been in the old days of cattle -rieving, and 
perhaps in the later days of smuggling. 



86 CALLANDER TO LOCH CATRINE. 

Somewhere near the entrance of the defile Sir Walter 
Scott intended to lay the death scene of Fitz- James' over- 
ridden horse. The guides show the exact spot witli 
true Highland precision. Nay, farther, they will assert, 
as indeed they truly believe, that the event was no Saxon 
poet's dream, but that it happened and happened there. 
In such a circimistance one may moralise on the certainty 
of tradition, and reflect how an idle tale striking the 
fancy, at length becomes ineradicably imbedded in po- 
pular belief. The romance of the Lady of the Lake, 
not half a century old, is the most distinct and well 
attested of ancient Highland traditions. 

Winding between those verdure-clad rocks we come 
to a clear, deep, rock-girt pool, so narrow that, as the 
poet well says, it would scarce serve 

" The wild duck's brood to swim." 

Gradually as the tourist advances, it winds this way 
and that, and it is difficult to know whether the rocky 
eminences, so densely covered with verdure, and washed 
by the clear deep waters, are chains of islands, or head- 
lands wriggling their way through the water. At length 
you get gradually clear of this twining confused ganglion 
of land and water ; the latter widens into a full bright 
sheet, and so (9|^) Loch Catrine is before you. 

A favourable spot for a general panoramic view, 
will expose on the left the broken luxurious masses 
of the Trosachs ; on the right and behind high banks 
covered with hazel, oak, birch, pine, and an under- 
wood of feathery tropical-looking fern ; while above, 
if it happens to be visible from the selected spot, 
the sharp bare spiked summit of Ben-a'an runs up 
like one of the alpine aiguilles. In front are an island 
or two, with headlands, scarce distinguishable from 
them ; but the finest object in the view is, undoubtedly. 



LOCH CATRINE. 87 

the hill of Benvenne, on the opposite side of the lake. 
Scarcely any other hill in the world has such a nobly 
graduated outline, and combines such rich beauty with 
alpine dignity. The corries and crags, softened by 
distance, are blended with the luxuriant herbage ; and 
the whole character, if the day be fine, conveys a pe- 
culiar sense of sweetness, combined with dignity. 
Even the great Coir-nan-Uriskin seems but a gentle 
opening in the wavy surface of the hill. 

Among the places to be immediately visited is this 
opening in the face of Benvenue, which, looking so 
gentle at a distance, resolves itself, on a nearer ap- 
proach, into the dread 

COIR-NAN-URISKlN, OR GOBLIN's CAVE, 

Where, when approached by boats," is seen a hideous 
chaotic dispersal of huge stones, as if some Titanic 
ploughshare had torn the stony mountain to its bowels, 
and tossed the fragments on either side. It is worth 
Wsiting, not only for its poetic associations, but as 
one of the most remarkable specimens of the High- 
land corry. These peculiar gashes which seam the 
mountains are supposed to have their origin in the 
bursting of springs. The cistern in the stony heart of 
the mountain goes on regularly enough, bubbling out 
its burn or well. But some day a water-spout or un- 
usual supply of rain fills it full, and also fills full the 
pipes or ducts by which it is supplied from the top of 
the hill. The known law of hydi-aulic pressure, on 
which the hydraulic press is founded, then acts. The 
spring staves out the side of the mountain as fermenting 
liquor staves a cask, and hence that hurricane of rocks 
and stones scattered on either side like the moraines of 
the Alpine glaciers. Climbing up through this mighty

debris, a sort of rock- surrounded platform is reached, 
which is the scene in the po.em. Near the projecting 
rocks above, a view may be taken of the lake and the 
Trosachs, the converse of that which has been seen 
from the other side. On the shoulder of the hill is the 
strand glade overhung with birch trees, constituting a 
terrace or natural pass, called the 

BEAL-ACH-NAM-BO, 

Or pass of the cattle. It was evidently the way by 
which the cattle taken in forays was conveyed within 
the protection of the Trosachs, at the time when they 
could only be passed by a ladder. We have here the 
scene where the Douglas of the poem, having retreated 
with his daughter Ellen, King James coming after her, 
:^ot into his difficulties, and caused the tragic events of 
the story. 

(10) Ellen's isle, 

" The Stranger \'iew'd the shore around ; 
'Twas all so close with copsewood bound, 
Nor track nor pathway might declare 
That human foot frequented there. 
Until the moimtain-maiden show'd 
A clambering unsuspected road, 
That winded through the tangled screen, 
And open'd on a narrow green, 
Where weeping birch and willow round 
With their long fibres swept the ground. 
Here, for retreat in dangerous hour. 
Some chief had framed a rustic bower." 

A few years ago, the tasteful fancy of the noble pro- 
prietor prompted him to complete the association of the 
spot by building there a sylvan lodge adorned with 
trophies of the chase ; but it was accidentally burnt, 
falling a sacrifice to the cigar of a careless tourist — a

class who, by the way, ought sometimes to reflect that 
they owe a little of their enjoyment to the toleration of 
the people among whom they sojourn ; and that they 
are bound to show some care and consideration for the 
objects aroiind them, as they enjoy their circuit of 
pleasure. 

Some early records of the Scottish Privy Council and the cri- 
minal courts show that of old the island was called Eilan Var- 
noch — a name that would certainly have been adopted by Sir 
Walter had he known it, for it has just the wild euphony which he 
always appropriated when he could find it, or made when he coulu 
not. But having been disused for nearly a couple of centuries as 
a safety retreat, the island had retained no traditional name in his 
days, and the records had not fallen in his way. With his intuitive 
sagacity, however, he had discovered that this was the safety re- 
treat of the neighbouring marauders, and wove its character and 
situation effectually into his romance. 

Here we are in the very eye and centre of the old soming, 
rieving, and foraying system which pervaded the Highlands. 
Of the derivations of Loch Catrine, we adopt without hesitation 
that which deduces it from the Highland word for plunderers. 
Some people say it still deserves the name — the only alte- 
ration iu the condition of matters being that whereas of old the 
C^ateran went to the plain to plunder the Saxon, the Saxon 
ndw goes to the hills to be plundered by the Cateran ; but 
let that pass — ^travellers are licensed grumblers, especially on 
the sore subject of bills. The Caterans of old were, at all events, 
persons of a more formidable character. To see how Eilan 
Varnoch was so well situated as their depot, one has but to 
look around him and observe the nature of the country, remember- 
ing at the same time the nature of that which has just been left 
behind. Here we have a spot singularly inaccessible. To ap- 
proach it on the one side the great barrier of the Trosachs had to 
be passed, where a few resolute men could defy and destroy an 
army. Xor was it a much more safe or easy enterprise to sail up 
Loch Lomond, and cross the country to attack them, and, if the 
enemy should pierce to Loch Catrine, the difficulty of getting at 
the island still remained. 

Allien taunted by Fitz-Jjimes, Roderick Dhu vindicates tha 
practice of cattle-rieving by saying — 

■' Pent in this fortress of the North, 
Think'st thou we will not sally forth. 



90 CALLANDER TO LOCH CATRINE. 

To spoil the spoiler as we may, 
And from the robber rend the prey ? 
Ay, by my soul ! — Wliile on yon plain 
The Saxon rears one shock of grain ; 
While, of ten thousand herds, there strays 
But one along yon river's maze, — 
The Gael, of plain and river heir, 
Shall, with strong hand, redeem his share. 
Where live the mountain chiefs who hold 
That plundering Lowland tield and fold 
Is aught but retribution true?" 

It may be questioned, however, if the rievers troubled themselves 
with views so refined. Wordsworth has well described their 
system as 

" The good old plan 

That they should take who have the power. 
And they should keep who can." 

And of the character of the operation, fair Ellen herself only gives 
too accurate an account when she says — 

" When back by lake and glen they wind. 
And in the Lowland leave behind. 
Where once some pleasant hamlet stood, 
A mass of ashes slaked in blood." 

These forays, it must be confessed, despite all the romance cast 
around Highland life, were ferocious and sanguinary affairs. The 
criminal charges brought against the frequenters of this beautiful 
island are sadly in contrast with the scene of peace and loveliness 
which it now presents. They refer not merely to great forays of 
cattle, but to every kind of plunder, and shew that the depredators 
committed many murders, not only against men who might resist, 
but against women and children. It would put the tourist out of 
humour for enjoying the romance of the spot and its associations, 
were we to particulari.se these outrages with the sordid character 
possessed by them when they make their appearance in indictments 
and other such like documents, more fitted for perusal in the winter 
evenings in the study then on the sunny banks of the loch. 

But whatever atrocities these outlaws perpetrated, it must be 
admitted that the law gave them very little inducement to be 
honest citizens. The inhabitants of the district, though the name 
of Stewart now prevails among them, were of old generally of 
that M'Gregor tribe who were pei-potually at war with the law. 
Wliich side began the contest may he a nice question ; but il was

between savages, or rather between the Ravage and the par- 
tially civilized, in any part of the world. Among the earliest 
and most tragical of its events was the slaughter of Drummond, 
one of the king's deer-keepers. To profess that he could pro- 
tect the royal privilege of the chase in those savage solitudes, 
where the people acknowledged no king but their chief, was 
absurd enough. Drummond, however, was able to exercise his 
oflSce of royal deer-keeper at all events te the extent of mak- 
ing deadly enemies. He bad professed to treat some of the wild 
children of the mountains as poachers, and threatened them with 
punishment. They in their turn did not waste their energies on 
threats, but proceeded to action. ^VTien the nuptials of King 
James VI., the son of Queen Mary, with Anne of Denmark were 
to be celebrated, Drummond went to the hills to kill some red 
deer to grace the occasion. His enemies caught him, and cut ofl' 
his head. They paid a visit to his brother-in-law, Stewart of 
Ardvoirlich, in the neighbouring parish of Comrie. Stewart was 
not at home, but his wife, the sister of the decapitated royal fo- 
rester, received them with such hospitality as the house afforded. 
Being in a very sportive humour, they set the head on the table, 
putting some of the food between the lips. The poor woman, 
entering the room and recognising the features of her brother in 
the ghastly exhibition, is said to have run forth a maniac. 

The perpetrators of this outrage are said to have been 
the M'Donalds of Glencoe. ANTioever they were, taking with them 
that desirable article, the head, they retired within the country of 
the M'Gregors. In these kindred spirits they found ready coadju- 
tors; and taking the head or "pow," as it was called, they all 
laid their hands on it, and swore, as on a suitable altar, that 
they would stand through blood by those who had slain the king's 
keeper. The method in which the government endeavoured to 
strike such marauders, was not by sending a body of policemen or 
of soldiers against them — that would have been expensive — but 
by encouraging any family or clan with whom they were at enmity 
to destroy them. The Colquhouns of Luss, who possessed a con- 
siderable extent of fertile territory on the west side of Loch Lo- 
mond, were peculiarly open to the ravages of the M'Gregors, who 
could attack them both by land and water. The government 
thought that bj' arming the Colquhouns, and stirring them on to 
an attack on the fastnesses, the M'Gregors would soon be extermi- 
nated. The freebooters, however, when they saw preparations 
making against them, resolved on taking the aggressive. In the 
year 1603, a body of the clan, under M'Gregor of Glenstrae, 
penetrated to Glen Fruin, a valley descending towards Loch Lo- 
mond from the eminences separating its basm from that of the 
Gare Loch. It was said that tney went only to have a friendly con- 
ference with the Colquhouns : but whatever may have been intended, 



92 CALLANDER TO LOCH CATRINE. 

certain it is that a deadly battle was fought, and that 140 of the 
Colquhouns were slaughtered. Sir Walter Scott and others credit 
the assertion that the Highlanders, in their savage hate, were 
not content with putting to death their feudal enemies, but slaugh- 
tered a number of joung students congregated on an eminence to 
see the conflict. Several neighbouring gentlemen of considerable 
rank fell in the field of Glen Fruin ; and it is in allusion to this 
that, rather against ehronological order, Roderick Dhu's trium- 
phant bard sings — 

Proudly our pibroch has thrill'd in Glen Fruin, 
And Bannochars groans to our slogan replied ; 
Glen Luss and Ross-dhu, they are smoking in ruin. 
And the best of Loch Lomond lie dead on her side. 

But the victors did not neglect the main chance ; they drove 
back, in fact, a magnificent foray, consisting of 600 head of cattle, 
800 sheep and goats, and 280 horses, to be dispersed in Ellen's 
Isle and their other strongholds. 

It was after this that the whole race of M'Gregors were de- 
nounced by one Act of Parliament after another. They were pro- 
hibited from using their clan name of the sons of Gregor, which 
they proudly said connected them with the ancient kings of the 
race of M'Alpine. They were not entitled to the protection of 
the law. It was decreed meritorious to kill them, and the neigh- 
bouring potentates, ambitious of possessing their lands, were en- 
couraged to extirpate them. Plans were arranged for removing 
their children and bringing them up in Fifeshire or other parts ol' 
the peaceful Lowlands. Their women even were hunted, and when 
caught were branded with a red-hot key. It was death for any of 
them to assemble in a greater number than four at a time ; and 
they were prohibited from using any weapon save a blunt-pointed 
knife to cut their meat. But it was all in vain ; their country was so 
very convenient for plundering the Lowlands, that they lived on 
marauding, in spite of the law and their enemies. That the\' should 
become thorough barbarians under such a system was nfitural, 
and perhaps the Indian forests or the New Zealand mountains 
scarcely owned a more savage race than those who lurked on the 
lovely banks of Loch Catrine, 

A walk along the north bank of Loch Catrine will 
hardly repay the pedestrian's industry, as the scene be- 
comes comparatively flat and tame, and the way is rugged 
and tiresome. The majority of tourists now take the 
steamer to the head of the Loch. The steamer is a 
coniparatively recent innovation. A set of stout rowers 



LOCH CATRINE HEAD. 93 

had established themselves at Loch Catrine, like their 
multitudinous and noisy brethren at Killarney, indeed 
differing from them only in substituting, as the hero of 
their traditions, Eoderick Dhu for O'Donahue. The 
Ivoch Catrine boatmen thought they had not only a life- 
lease of their pleasant and profitable occupation, but 
looked to their children inheriting it ; when, in the year 
1846, they were superseded by an invidious little 
steamer. The spirit of Clan Alpine had not, however, 
departed. One fine morning when the usual cargo of 
passengers came up to the Loch the steamer had dis- 
appeared. 

From the head of the loch, the tourist may pene- 
trate Glengyle, entering the main stream which empties 
itself into the loch, and proceeding in a south-easterly 
direction up the wooded glen and making a circuit ; or by 
turning abruptly up by the right and keeping one of the 
minor feeders of the main stream which falls into the 
loch, he may reach Balquhidder. Glengyle is an old 
possession of the M'Gregor family, and its melodious 
name recommended it to Scott for service in his poetry. 
The place has a curious history in reference to the 
practice often spoken of in connection with the High- 
lands, the levying of black mail. 

(15|^) STRONACLACHAN NEW INN. 

A few years ago, a cluster of Highland ponies with 
their gilly attendants were generally in waiting here 
for tourists crossing this isthmus, and, when they were 
too few in number, the unprovided had to walk — the

path of that day. Now, however, the road has been 
somewhat improved, and an omnibus conveys passengers

During the summer months — June to September — there is 
generally a cheap trip, on a certain day of the week, from Edin- 
burgh and Glasgow to Loch liOmond Head and back, which is a 
favourable opportunity, as far as expense is concerned, of viewing 
this scenery. This year, 1853, this trip is every Monday: and 
the charge from Edinburgh to the head of the loch and back the 
same day, first class and cabin, is 8s. 6d. It is, however, rather 
too long a journey from Edinburgh to be accomplished pleasantly 
in so limited a time. 

Taking Glasgow as a starting point, we now sup- 
pose the tourist approaching from the west that in- 
teresting cluster of Highland scenery, through which 
we have hitherto been attempting to guide him from 
the eastern side. It is in the western direction 
that, reversing of course what now follows, we would 
expect one who has entered it from Stirling to complete 
the tour, and, in the same manner, one who passes 
from the Clyde to Loch Lomond, and thence by Loch 
Catrine with or without its detours, to Stirling, will go 
over what we have previously laid down in the inverse 
direction to that in which we have set it forth.

is easily accessible both by land and water, and the 
traveller who is near railway or westcoast steam com- 
munication, cannot fail, by consulting the ordinary tables, 
in speedily finding his way to the spot. As Stirling 
seems to stand sentinel between the Highlands and 
Lowlands on the eastern side, much more does this 
strange abrupt rock, apparently rising out of the

centre of the water, seem to perform this function 
on the Clyde. Like almost all the abrupt mountain 
masses penetrating the great valley from north to south, 
it is a trap rock, partly amorphous, but partly with a 
columnar tendency. It is 560 feet high — a goodly 
height for a mere solitary stone standing by the water 
side ; and it takes the full advantage of its elevation, 
in its grand and abrupt proportions. The buildings on 
it are of no great architectural interest, nor would it 
have been easy for architecture to have done itself jus- 
tice in connection with natural productions so large. 
It now professes to be little more than a small barrack 
for 200 men, with a few petty old-fashioned works. 
None of them bear a character of gi-eat antiquity, but 
it is likely that some of the foundations and more mas- 
sive parts of the building may be very ancient, for the 
earliest use of this remarkable rock as a fortress is 
among those venerable things whose age tradition notes 
not. Meanwhile, the most obviously ancient-looking 
thing connected with it is an old two-handed sword 
called the veritable sword of Wallace. It was for some 
time in England, but its absence was so lamented as 
that of a national palladium, that it was restored. 

Dumbarton is identified with that Alclwyd, which 
was the capital of th6 small aboriginal kingdom of 
Strathclyde, the history of which has deeply perplexed 
antiquaries, since its appearances in the accounts of 
ancient writers are so scant and fugitive. Dumbarton 
is believed to have been the main fortress of this people, 
and it is supposed, though not on such good gi'ound, 
that they possessed Stirling as a defence on their 
eastern frontier. 

The fortress was obtained without a struggle by 
King Edward. The governor who gave it up to him 
was Sir Ingi-am D'Umfraville, one of those Norman

knights who had so many of the offices of trust in Scot- 
land, and who cared very little whether they held them 
from a king in London or a king in Edinburgh. It 
was given to the custody of Menteith, the betrayer of 
Wallace. How it was recovered by Bruce is not re- 
corded. On account of its great strength — for before 
the time of heavy artillery it was deemed impregnable — 
it remained in the possession of the Scots in the sub- 
sequent stniggles with England, though it was fre- 
quently assailed. At length it was taken in a siege 
during the unfortunate civil war of Scotland, with 
circumstances of romantic bravery. The governor 
Fleming held it for Queen Mary in 1571, and the 
party of the Eegent were determined to seize it. A 
daring fellow, John Crawford of Jordanhall, assembled in 
Glasgow a parly of trusty followers, not trained soldiers, 
but men who had been concerned in all shapes in the 
disturbances which then distracted the country, and 
who were well fitted for any original deed of daring. 
They reached the rock at midnight, with scaling 
ladders. Their project was nearly destroyed at its 
beginning, for the ladders first set for passing a pre- 
cipitous part of the rock, and reaching the platform 
above, lost their hold when the men were beginning 
to swarm up. A mist, however, enveloped the upper 
part of the rock, and the garrison, unable to see any- 
thing, seem not to have been disturbed by the noise. 
The besiegers proceeded scrambling over the slopes 
and ledges, and mounting the precipitous intervals with 
ladders, when a new difficulty occurred. One of the 
men, seized with a convulsive fit, remained immovable 
on the middle of the ladder, holding to it tightly. The 
conductor of the expedition lashing him to the ladder 
with cords, turned it round, and the ascent was accom- 
plished on the other side. The garrison was not aware 



98 GLASGOW TO LOCH LOMOND HEAD. 

of these operations until the besiegers made their ap- 
pearance on the top of the wall, and then they gave 
lip all for lost. Here the victors found John Hamilton, 
Archbishop of St. Andrews, the last Eoman Catholic 
Primate of Scotland. He had re-established his old 
consistory court, for the purpose of dissolving Both well's 
marriage, that he might marry Queen Mary, and from 
this and other circumstances, he was charged with 
accession to the murder of Darnley. His opponents 
gave themselves little trouble about the evidence — 
what they wanted was to get him put to death out of 
hand. He was hanged, and a poetic enemy affixed to 
the gibbet a Latin distich, praying that the tree might 
long flourish which bore such goodly fruit. 

But we must now leave the grim rock, casting 
back on it reflective sighs for the many state prisoners 
who, in the evil days of civil conflict, have pined year 
after year within its stony recesses. The six miles to 
Balloch at the northern extremity of Loch Lomond, are 
passed with great facility by the railway, which almost 
shovels one into the expectant? steamer. Close to the 
village of Eenton, not quite half-way, on the left, 
stands Smollett's monument. Its neglected state was 
lately the subject of some spirited newspaper corres- 
pondence, and we trust that the tourists of 1853 will 
And its promised repairs accomplished. The neigh-

he spent his childhood, more merry than that of ordi- 
nary mankind — and at the grammar-school of Dum- 
barton, he began to learn the classics, and, what he 
was better acquainted with, the peculiarities and eccen- 
tricities of mankind. On the other side of the railway 
runs his classic Leven.

LOCH LOMOND. 

Of the lake scenery in Britain, Loch Lomond 
stands the unrivalled head for a combination of the 
nobler features that become a lake. Its broad expanse 
of waters — its rich wooded and agricultural sloping 
banks — its archipelago of lovely islands in the lower 
reaches, far excel in expansive magnitude the English 
lakes, or the lower Lake of Killamey, while its long nar- 
row northmost termination penetrates deep into savage 
mountains whose vast precipitous sides overshadow its 
dark surface, and form a wonderful contrast to the gay, 
broad, smiling expanse of waters and cluster of islands 
left behind. It bears perhaps a greater similarity to 
Lucerne, " the sacred lake far off among the hills," 
than any other of our British waters. 

Its commencement is twenty miles from Glasgow and 
six from Dumbarton. Taking it fi-om the extreme 
northernmost point, the lake is nearly thirty miles long. 
In the lowlands it is from eight to ten miles broad, but 
as it penetrates among the mountains, it gradually 
becomes narrower until it almost insensibly merges in 
the river Falloch. Unlike the remote lakes entirely 
within the Highland boundary. Loch Lomond has an 
ancient renown as one of the wonders of the land, and 
the scene of historical incidents. Camden, in his 
Britannia, speaks of it as plentifully stocked with 
fish — of which it has one species peculiar in itself 
called pollac. " It is full of islands, concerning which 
the common people tell many traditional stories." 

Lochlomond is thus described by Sir Walter Scott in 
" Rob Roy : " — " The lofty peak of Ben Lomond, here the 



100 GLASGOW TO LOCFl LOMOND HEAD. 

predominant monarcli of the mountains, lay on our right 
hand, and served as a striking land-mark. I was not 
awakened from my apathy, until, after a long and toil- 
some walk, we emerged through a pass in the hills, 
and Loch Lomond opened before us. I will s])are you 
the attempt to describe what you would hardly com- 
prehend without going to see it. But certainly this 
noble lake, boasting inmimerable beautiful islands, of 
every varying form and outline which fancy can frame 
— rits northern extremity narrowing until it is lost 
among dusky and retreating mountains — while, gra- 
dually widening as it extends to the southward, it 
spreads its base around the indentures and promontories 
of a fair and fertile land, aftbrds one of the most sur- 
prising, beautiful, and sublime spectacles in nature." 

Lord Jeffrey was an idolater of Loch Lomond, and 
used often to withdraw there and refresh himself by its 
beauties. His opinion of it may be gathered from the 
following extract of letters to his father-in-law : — 

" Here we are in a little inn on the banks of Loch Lomond, in 
the midst of the mists of the moimtains, the lakes, heaths, rocks, 
and cascades, whicli have been my passion since 1 was a boy ; 
and to which, like a boy, I have run away the instant I could get 
my hands clear of law, and review, and Edinburgh. 

There are several favourite spots for obtaining a 
view of the lake. Among the most noted is an elevation 
near Kilpatrick with the unpromising name of Mount 
Misery, and one at Luss ; but the finest full Aiew is 
obtained from the top of Benlomond. 

The steamer usually skirts the eastern base of the 
lake to 

(6^) BALMAHA. 

Here tourists may reach Loch Lomond from the Edin- 
burgh and Glasgow Kailway by the Campsie Branch to 
Lennoxtown, whence there is generally a coach tu

Balfron. Along the eastern shore there is an oppor- 
tunity for admiring the rich park and woodland scenery, 
varied by gentle hills, and dotted with gentlemen's seats 
— predominant among which is Buchanan House, the 
seat of the Duke of ]\Iontrose. It was the rich pro- 
ductiveness of this district that tempted the Norwegians 
to make the strange piratical im-oad afterwards re- 
ferred to. 

ISLANDS. 

The steamer now threads its way through the 
archipelago of thirty islands which diversify the broader 
part of the lake. Many of them have curious re- 
mains of buildings, which might gratify an anticpiary. 
It is found that the churchmen, both of Ireland and 
the west of Scotland, were partial to monasteries or 
cells on lake islands — perhaps from their peaceful 
seclusion ; and they often lasted as burying-places 
after the religious edifice had departed. Of the four 
islands which occupy the greater part of the width of 
the lake slanting in a north-west direction, the largest 
is Inch Caillach, the burial-place of the MacGregors- 
The most easterly of these four — the largest island in 
the lake — Inch Murren, is used by the Duke of Mon- 
trose as a deer forest, or rather preserve, and the other 
large island, the northmost of the group, called Inch 
Loanag, serves the same purpose for the family of 
Colquhoun of Luss. Their "country," as it is called in 
the Highlands, or the territory peculiar to their name, is 
that which stretches along the left banl? of the lake 
where the swelling uplands gradually enlarge them- 
selves into craggy hills.

of those wild slaughters by the clan Gregor which

When the archipelago is left behind, and 

(13) THE POINT OF ROSS 

is passed to the right, we find ourselves gradually 
merging from the smiling low country into the dark 
masses of the Highland mountains. Ben Lomond 
rises close and high above the scene, with his gracefully 
waving outline, high peak, and far -stretching spurs or 
off-shoots. Close under his shadow we reach 

(15) ROWARDENNAN INN, 

the point from which, as we shall have afterwards to 
show, the ascent is gentlest. Thus far there is a 
regular road along the banks of the loch, but farther 
north its edge can only be kept by a scrambling foot- 
path. Eowardennan may be considered the entrance 
of the Highlands in this direction, and is the place 
to which the sons of Rob Eoy first conveyed the poor 
young widow whom they seized at Edinbellie. 

ASCENT OF BEN LOMOND. 

There are many excellent reasons, if we desire to 
ascend a hill, for selecting Ben Lomond before others. 
It has an old celebrity recognised in the Avorld of pic- 
turesque scenery. To have ascended it is to have done 
something that one can speak about. It is utterly use- 
less to claim credit for the ascent of hills of unknown 
fame, however high ; indeed, your enunciation of the 
prodigious heights of uncommemorated hills which you 
have ascended, is sometimes suspected to be a mere 
numerical echo of your great fatigue from the ascent, or 
altogether a hallucination. Ben Lomond is 3190 feet 
4 inches above the level of the sea, accordinsr to the 



BEN LOMOND ASCENT, 103 

trigonometrical survey. There are multitudes of moun- 
tain tops in Scotland further above the sea level, but 
their bases are on elevated land, and virtually they are 
far inferior as mountains. Then Ben Lomond has 
everything that we seek in mountain scenery — a grace- 
ful outline waving towards a high peak overlooking 
the surrounding world — deep corries and noble preci- 
pices. It is so placed at the extremity of the Gram- 
pians as to command in one direction the varied Iom' 
country — in the other, to show the full breadth, and in 
some measure the depth of the great Grampian range. 

THE ASCENT. 

It is most usual to make the ascent from Eowar- 
dennan. Here a pony path leads to the very summit, 
at least above the level of the great precipice, and the 
steeps which correspond with it on the other side, so 
that it reaches the gentler turfy ascent near the summit, 
where a path is unnecessary. Here it joins another 
path from Inversnaid, which winds among the secondary 
precipices on that side, and occasionally takes a scramble 
over rough places. It is a briefer, but not so gradual 
an ascent. Tourists starting from Tarbet with the 
intention of climbing the hill, cross the lake, and gene- 
rally strike up the Inversnaid path. This approach is 
recommended by the full view thus obtained of the con- 
tour of the mountain, showing distinctly how far it is 
clear of mist — a very important consideration. It is re- 
commended to all who ascend the hill on this western 
side, that they do not mistake for its summit that of a 
fine graceful offshoot, which rises to a conical point nearer 
the lake. Either from the lake itself or from the top of 
Ben Lomond, one would think it impossible to mistake 
this for the chief height. Yet, when we climb it, it is 
amazing how well it passes itself off for its great neigh- 



104 GLASGOW TO LOCH LOMOND HEAD. 

hour, and how readily the thoughtless novice in hill climb- 
ing, easily deceived by his desire to see the termination of 
his toils, is prepared to accept it for the reality. To 
reach this top, however, and find how much higher the 
real summit is, with a considerable valley between, is a 
real annoyance and mortification ; and we mention it 
as a warning, because we have heard of the mistake 
occurring. 

If the tourist employ a guide, he is of course not 
liable to make this blunder ; nor, when he reaches the 
true summit of the Ben, to find his way in the evening 
through radiating corries to some totally distinct quar- 
ter from that whence he had ascended, leaving his 
friends in uncertainty about his fate. Some people, 
however, are not partial to guides, looking on the per- 
petual presence of such a director as an infringement on 
the liberty of the subject. We should wish to be of 
what service we can to such independent spirits, and so, 
as a general rule, we would recommend them not to 
attempt the ascent in mist, and in any case to take the 
bearings of the top before ascending, so as, by the aid 
of the pocket compass, to find the way back, should mist 
unexpectedly come on. 

Ther^ are innumerable directions whence it may be 
approached from the other side ; but we shall only men- 
tion one, because it is not only a very interesting route to 
the top of the mountain, but may suit very well for the 
descent, if the tourist, having ascended from the lake, 
is desirous of pursuing his journey to Aberfoyle or Loch 
Catrine. Striking from the head of Loch Ard across a 
ridge of hills, and descending on the Deuchry, two re- 
spectable-looking cottages may be seen. The one, so far 
as one can take down the native sound, is called Comer, 
the other Stuick-vuick, or the goat-field ; and it is con- 
spicuous from a large square field or paddock enclosed

by a dyke. Here descends irom the north-east a rapid 
stream. Ascending its western hank, there is mnch fine 
lonely scenery — the brawling stream sometimes leaping 
over considerable barriers of rock, and flanked by mural 
precipices on the one side, and on the other by the 
gradations of the mountain with its frowning precipice 
above. It may be questioned which ascent is the more 
interesting, for on this side the view of the loch, its 
islands, and the opposite range of the hills bursts on 
»the eye as a novelty after the shoulder is turned, 
while the precipitous corries have become familiar as 
companions in the ascent — from the other side the lake 
scenery and the open view have been iqore or less 
companions of our toils all the way, and the peep from 
the edge over the precipice into the mysterious depths 
below is the surprise. 

From whatever point the hill be ascended, this preci- 
pice is a great and striking object. It extends in a long, 
almost semicircular wall, bounding the deep corrie, 
which, from its inmost scoop, has a steep green turf 
ascent. We are not acquainted with any authentic 
measurement of the precipice, and guesses are useless, 
for the eye measures by the grade of magnitudes it has 
last become accustomed to. The precipice is not quite 
vertical, but with a slight slope towards the top. In 
a longitudinal glance along its surface, its various 
breaks give it almost a columnar appearance, though, 
from its geological nature as mica slate, it has no right 
whatever to assume such a character. Often in the 
hollow gazed down on from the edge of the precipice, 
the mists, as if they could not get out, remain, while 
the rest of the hill is clear, and increase the mysterious 
awfulness to those who gaze over the edge, and see the 
precipice lose itself in a rolling ocean of dark clouds. 
Often, too, while the hill on the south-western slopes is 



106 GLASGOW TO LOCH LOMOND HEAD. 

bright and warm in the spring sunshine, this hollow is 
deeply coated with snow, and, from the aid given by 
this mass to the night frosts, the recesses of the preci- 
pice are covered with a rich crystallization of hoar frost, 
while, safely removed from its edge, one may bask in 
the warm mid-day sun. 

The summit rises in a round mass northward of the 
precipice. It cannot be mistaken in a clear day, and 
in a misty is not much worth finding. A bee-hive 
looking edifice of turf distinguishes it, and, if the tour- 
ist think it necessary to be absolutely at the utmost 
height, he will climb this, at more risk of minor per- 
sonal injury from a slip down than he has yet encoun- 
tered. 

It is diflScult 'to describe the scene from the top. 
Grand and lovely to a high degree, it shows on one 
side the Grampian mountains indefinitely swelling west- 
ward mound after mound — on the west the Argyllshire 
hills, and on the south and east the great Scottish Low- 
land district, with its minor mountain ranges. The most 
fascinating object, however, is Loch Lomond, clear below 
in all its reaches and indentations, with its bright waters 
studded with islands. If one has just steamed through, it 
is difficult to suppose how the great expanse of water 
can have become that pretty minutely diversified pond. 
How small the islands look ! At the headland of Boss 
point, a hill may have attracted notice as one of incon- 
siderable height ; but here it seems as if it were, with 
its peaked top, a toy imitation of Ben Lomond, which 
might be put on a chimney-piece. So the hill nearer 
the lake, which some, as we have mentioned, have 
sometimes mistaken for Ben Lomond, seen hence makes 
such a mistake seem ridiculous, if not impossible. It 
has been mentioned, in the earlier part of this guide, 
that the Grampian range, with Ben Lomond, has a 



BEN LOMOND THE TOP. 107 

fine effect from Ben Cleucb of the Ochils, but now Ben 
Lomond by no means returns the compliment, for Ben 
Clench has a very humble snubbed aspect when it is 
looked at from its superior. 

The tourist books of last century are always elo- 
quent in praise of some lines on the ascent of Ben Lo- 
mond, scratched on a window pane of the Inn at 
Tarbet, and signed J. Eussel ; and, though their 
poetic claims may be denied, their merit, as a distinct 
statement of what their author has to say, are consider- 
able. After an invocation, not to the muse, but to the 
stranger casting a casual glance over the pane of glass, 
lie says : — 

" Trust not at first a quick adventurous pace, 
Six miles its top points gradual from its base ; 
Up the high rise with panting haste I past, 
And gained the long laborious steep at last ; 
More prudent thou — when once you pass the deep. 
With cautious steps and slow ascend the steep." 

After offering counsel so eminently disinterested, it 
is to be regretted that the next morsel of advice is 
tainted with a slight admixture of dissipation. 

•• Oh ! stop a while — oft taste the cordial drop. 
And rest, oh ! rest — long long upon the top. 
There hail the breezes, nor with toilsome haste, 
Down the rough slope thy useful vigour waste ; 
So shall thy wondering sight at once survey- 
Woods, lakes, and mountains, valleys, rocks, and sea. 
Huge hills that heaped in crowded order stand, 
Stretched o'er the western and the northern land 
Enormous groups." 

Shortly before reaching Tarbet, there is seen a 
pretty white mansion with woody recesses leading up to 
the mountains behind, and umbrageous lawns spreading 
gently downwards to the brink of the lake. This is 
(19) Stuck Gown — pronounced Stugoon, the favourite 
Highland residence of Francis Jeffrey, to which he de- 



108 GLASGOW TO LOCH LOMOND HEAD, 

lighted to retreat from the dust, drudgery, and gaiety of 
town life. He thus writes : — 

" This place is more beautiful than ever, and the sight of Swit- 
zerland has not spoiled it in the least. . . . Yesterday being 
glorious with sun and calm, we Avent to the top of Ben Lomond 
quite leisurely and comfortably ; saw all the glorious company of 
mountains, from Ben Nevis to Stirling ; and also our own shadows, 
surrounded with glories, reflected on the mist. . . . You 
will see no lakes like this lake, nor hills like these ; and we have 
many more sounding rills, and singing cascades, and far more of 
that deep solitude and wild seclusion, which speak to the heart 
more impressively than shade or verdure can ever do without 
them." 

(21) TARBET INN. 

A beautiful road bordering the shore leads from 
this to the head of the loch, a distance of nine or ten 
miles. From Tarbet the tourist can reach Arrochar, 
at head of Loch Long, in half an hour, the distance 
being only 1^ mile. 

It is usual for the steamer to reach Tarbet in time 
to give parties an opportunity of enjoying the delight- 
ful walk from thence to Arrochar, and to catch tlie 
afternoon steamer from Arrochar to Glasgow. 

At Tarbet there is perhaps the most complete and 
expressive view of Benlomond — the expanse of waters 
between preventing any object from breaking the full 
effect of the scene. From this the distances to the 
following places by rowing boats are calculated as 
follows : —

ROB ROY's prison. 

Nearly opposite to Tarbet is a rock whence it is 
traditionally said that Eob Roy let down his prisoners 
by a rope, that when they were suspended half way 
down, while he stood at ease above, he might make 
terms with them on highly advantageous circumstances 
for claiming good conditions. 

(24) INVERSNAID. 
[The Station for Loch Catrine and the Trosacbs.] 

Close to it there is a fine clattering waterfall, as well 
seen from the steamer when landing as from the shore, 
since the water almost tumbles into the lake. This 
is one of the points for ascending Ben Lomond, and 
from which passengers cross to Loch Catrine. " The 
family and descendants of Dugald Ciar Mhor (the 
MacGregors) lived chiefly in the mountains between 
this and Loch Catrine, and occupied a good deal of 
property there — whether by sufferance, by the right of 
the sword, which it was never safe to dispute with 
them, or by legal titles of various kinds, it would be 
useless to inquire and unnecessary to detail. 
Rob's own designation was of Liversnaid ; but he ap- 
pears to have acquired a right of some kind or other to 
the property or possession of Craig Royston, a domain of 
rock and forest lying on the east side of Loch Lomond, 
where that beautiful lake stretches into the dusky moun- 
tains of Glenfalloch." — Rob Roy^ Introduction. 

This is also the spot chosen by Sii* Walter Scott 
for Rob Roy's parting with Frank Osbaldistone and 
Bailie Nicol Jarvie. " A boat awaited us in a creek 
beneath a huge rock, manned by four lusty Highland 
rowers ; and our host took leave of us with great cor- 
dialitv and even affection. . . . Rob Rov remained 



110 GLASGOW TO LOCH LOMOND HEAD. 

for some time standing on the rock from beneath which 
we had departed, conspicuous by his long gun, waving 
tartans, and the single plume in his cap, which, in 
those days, denoted the Highland gentleman and sol- 
dier." — Rob Boi/, chap, xxxvi. 

We are now in the centre of the mountains, which 
are ever, as we advance, changing their shape. Ben 
Lomond is left behind. On the left, rising above the 
minor heights, are seen occasionally the distorted horny 
projections of Ben Arthur or the Cobler, the most strange 
and extravagant of the tvvistings of the mica slate rock, 
and a very fine geological specimen — though too large 
to be removed to any museum of the present age. 
Near the lake, are the less eccentric but commanding 
tops of Crocherechan and the Avestern Ben Voirlich, on 
the ascent of which is the lonely tarn Loch Sloy, whence 
the Macfarlanes, the old rivals of the MacGregors, took 
their clan battle-cry. More to the right is Bencharra, 
and at a greater distance, and seldom seen for the inter- 
vening heights, Ben More, the great hill. Almost 
more striking, however, than these more distant eleva- 
tions, are the truly mountainous banks of the now 
narrow lake darkened by their reflection. On the face 
of the rock is a cavern called 

(25) ROB roy's cave. 

Its opening is scarcely visible, and is only noticeable 
from the steamer by two circles painted upon one of 
the rocks. " The eastern side, peculiarly rough and 
rugged, was at this time the chief seat of MacCrregor 
and his clan — to curb whom, a small garrison had been 
stationed in a central position betwixt Loch Lomond 
and another lake. The extreme strength of the 
country, however, with the numerous passes, marshes.

caverns, and other places of concealment or defence, 
made the establishment of this little fort seem rather 
an acknowledgment of the danger, than an effectual 
means of securing against it." These crags rise in 
dark precipitous masses to a vast height, the waters 
around seem unfathomably deep, mansions and culti- 
vation are left behind, a solemn silence reigns, and 
altogether the impressions of grandeur and gloom 
from the sail thro\igh the upper reach of Loch Lomond 
are remarkably impressive even to those accustomed to 
mountain scenery. The uses of a large stone to be 
seen on the left, remind one of the remote loneliness 
of the country around, though the steam-boat daily 
ploughs the lake with its crowd of tourists. The stone 
serves as a pulpit and vestry of a church, for it has a 
cell cut into its face with a door, and here at intervals 
a preacher serves the congregation gathering aroimd in 
the open air. We pass one small island (27^), Inver- 
uglen, far separated from its companions, ere reaching the 
end. It contains the remains of an old square tower, 
said to have been a safety retreat of the Macfarlanes. 
Presently the lake narrows into a river with a sedgy 
margin, twisting through a small patch of flat alluvial 
land, brought down by it from the mountain. It is a 
peaceful, quiet, gentle stream, as any English river, 
meandering among its meadows, and no one seeing its 
hypocritical tranquillity would dream, that farther up it 
tears its way through broken rocks and chafes itself into 
furious torrents. The steamer moors within the stream 
of the Falloch, at what is called 

LOCH LOMOND HEAD. 

[Ardlui Hotel.]

valley between them, that the only route the tourist 
can take onwards must be in the first place through 
Glen Falloch. 

DETOURS FROM LOCHLOMOND HEAD. 

From Ardlui Inn, at the head of Loch Lomond, there are threo 
favourite Routes through the Highlands, each of which may be 
travelled, during the summer season, by the Glencoe and Benvoir- 
lioh coaches, which run in connection with the steamer on Loch 
Lomond and Dumbartonshire Railway. 

FuiST Route — The Glencoe coach proceeds by way of Glenfalloch 
to Crianlarich. From thence by StrathfiUan, the Holy 
Pool, the King's Field, and Benmore, to Tyndrum. Hills 
of Glenorchy, through the Marquis of Breadalbane's Deer 
Forest of the Black Mount, the Moors of Rannoch, Lochs 
Tulla and Lydoch, King's House Inn, and the Royal 
Forest, passing near General Wade's old military road, 
known as the Devil's Staircase, through the wild scenery 
of Glencoe, Ballachulish and along the banks of Loch 
Linnhe to Fort- William, situated at the foot of Ben Nevis. 
From this, tourists may proceed by the Caledonian Canal 
to Inverness. 

Second Route — Same way to T}Tidrum, from thence westwards 
by Glenorchy, Dalmally, Kilchurn Castle, Loch Awe, Ben 
Cruachan, Taynuilt, to Oban. 

Third Route — The other Glencoe coach proceeds the same way 
to Crianlarich. From that it branches off eastwards by 
StrathfiUan, Glendochart, and Lochanour, foot of the lofty 
Beimiore, Coirchaorach, the birth-place of Rob Roy, Loch 
Dochart, Killin, the ruins of Finlarig Castle, the northern 
shore of Loch Tw, the base of Ben Lawers, village of 
Kenmorc, and Ta^Tnouth Castle, to Aberfeldy. Coaches in

114 LOCH LOMOND HEAD TO OBAN. 

In visiting Glencoe by the coach during the summer, tourists 
are recommended to do so, going northwards from Glasgow and 
Lochlomond Head, rather than coming southwards from Fort- 
William, Oban, or Ballachulish. By the northward road, besides 
other advantages, is that of arriving at the glen in the evening 
when the strong lights, deep shadows, and other effects produced 
by the rays of the setting sun greatly enhance the grandeur of the 
scene, and the pleasure of witnessing and remembering it. 

By the other way, coming southwards from Ballachulish, &amp;c., 
the coach, which is open, and affords no shade, arrives during the 
hottest part of the day, when the rays of the sun descend vettically 
into the valley, distributing light and shade uniformly through- 
out. The scenery, in this case, is not seen to such advantage ; it 
is often uncomfortably hot, and the glare of light even painful for 
the eyesight. In addition to this, the ascent going in this direc- 
tion being very considerable, it is necessary, every now and then, 
to get out of the coach, and sometimes under a broiling sun, to 
climb vigorously all the steep portions of the road, which is 
avoided here the other way. Tliese circumstances, together with 
the constant shifting and re-arranging of seats tend very much to 
dissipate the grandeur and solemnity that pervades the scene, and 
by distracting the mind from what, during the limited space of 
time allowed, should engross the attention, they are apt to curtail 
the expected pleasure, if they do not bring disappointment. 
Altogether there is little room to doubt that the way northwards 
is, in every respect, the best and pleasantest for the tourist.

116 INVERARY CASTLE. 

INVERARY. 

[Hotels.— The Ai^le.] 
Tourists intending to proceed from this by coach to Oban, are 
recommended to lose no time in getting themselves booked at the 
hotel. 

Inverary, near the head of Loch Fine, may be 
deemed one of tne most usual radiating centres of the 
Argyleshire lake scenery, and is the capital of Argyle- 
shire and of the Campbell country. It has a fine for- 
tified-looking aspect from the water. Its cross is one of 
the most symmetrical of the Highland scnlptm-ed stones, 
but it has evidently been tampered with. Near it is 
Inverary Castle, by no means to be commended for its 
architecture. It apes the Gothic baronial style, but 
was built about a century ago — a time when the details 
of Gothic architecture were not studied. The grounds 
are a magnificent variety of mountain and forest scenery. 
Some of the glades, with broad venerable trees on either 
side, and great rocks above, are unrivalled in dignity. 
The hill of Duniquoich affords a pleasant climb and 
extensive prospect of the surrounding country. A 
fine cataract may be seen on the road to Loch Awe. 
There is considerable interest in this neighbourhood for 
geologists. Here are many metaliferous rocks, and, in 
the grounds near the castle, a mine of nickel mixed with 
copper has lately been opened. Porphyries and granites 
of a fine close grain abound ; the pier of Inverary is 
built of porphyry. The stone of which the castle and 
its offices are built, from the dark uniform colour and 
clean cut, looks like marble ; but on examination it 
turns out to be a close grained schist, probably chlorate, 
from its soapy feeling to the touch. The quarry whence 
it has been taken is at St. Catherine's, on the opposite 
side of the loch, and tradition says that the stones were 
taken over on the ice in a memorablv severe winter. 



INVERARY. 117 

On a jutting rock, about three miles above Inverary, 
is the gaunt, tall, square keep of Dunderaw Castle, 
the stronghold of the M'Xaughtans. One is inclined to 
wonder how M'Callum Mohr allowed a rival to come so 
near his capital. Some curiously carved stones built 
into it, suggest that this edifice has been built from the 
ruins of an ecclesiastical building. The laird had stuck 
an admonitory motto &lt;m human pride over his doorway, 
whether for his own use or other people's, in these 
terms — " I man behald the end. Be nocht wiser than 
the highest is. I hope in God." A few miles below Inver- 
ary, on the opposite side of the loch and at the opening 
of a beautiful little green strath, is the square tower of 
Castle Lauchlan, the fortalice of the M'Lauchlans. 

Inverary may be reached by a continuous steam 
voyage up the lake, diverging at Loch Gilp from the 
route by the Crinan Canal. It is a tedious but very 
pleasant voyage. The scenery is varied, mountainous 
of course, but not of the grand or terriffic character. 
The banks of the lower part of the loch are so thickly 
studded with ever increasing mansions that it would 
be tedious to enumerate them. There are other and 
shorter methods, partly by land, partly by water, of 
reaching Inverary. The humble pedestrian, or he 
who luxuriously posts, may take one of the multitudi- 
nous steamers from Greenock or any other point, and 
be landed at Kilmun on the Holy Loch, or Ardentinny 
on Loch Long. Thence he may proceed along the 
borders of Loch Eck, a scene of remarkable beauty 
and grandeur. The hills rise above it in great broken 
masses — the lake itself, gentle and generally smooth as 
glass, throws little bays into soft gi'een meadows — while 
occasionally a mossy and heathery tongue of land 
stretches into the lake — 



1:18 INTER ARY CASTLE. 

And just a trace of silver sand 

Marks where the water meets the land. 

At the head of the lake we descend on Strachur, the 
summer residence of Lord Murray, deep nestling among 
old trees, gardens, and green-houses. The church- 
yard hard by is remarkable for some of the ancient 
sculptured stones already mentioned, covered with the 
mystic knot and other strange devices. If you ask the 
country people their history, they will tell you that they 
were stolen from lona ; that the ship which brought 
them over was wrecked with another such sacrilegious 
cargo in Loch Fine ; and that thus many sculptured 
stones lie to this day at the bottom of the lake. The 
journey either from Kilmun or Ardentinny to the 
ferry between St. Catherine's and Inverary may be about 
seventeen miles. 

A favourite route to Inverary is by the steamer to 
LochGoil head, and by coach across the isthmus — seven 
miles — passing through a rocky defile dignified by the 
name of Hell's Glen. There are some fine rugged 
mountains enclosing the head of Loch Goil, and opening 
scrambling walks through noble scenery of cleft and tor- 
rent to those who sojourn a while there. An old square 
Highland keep projects into the loch half-way up, called 
Carrick Castle, a strength of the Dunmore family. With 
its foreground of lake and background of moimtains, 
it is a tempting object to the artist. In sailing 
here, one is of course reminded of Campbell's pathe- 
tic ballad, " Lord Ullin's Daughter." Poor Campbell 
indeed—- one of the noblest poets of our century — drew 
much of his inspiration from his native Argyleshire. 
The reader will remember the fine stanzas beginning — 

At the silence of twilight's contemplative hour, 

I have mused in a sorrowful mood, 
On the wind-shaken weeds that embosom the bower, 

Where the home of my forefathers stood. 



GLENCROE. 119 

All ruin'd and wild is their roofless abode, 

And lonely the dark raven's sheltering tree, 
And travelled by few is the grass-cover'd road, 
Where the hunter of deer and the warrior trod 
To his hills that encircle the sea. 

Tourists giving this route their preference, will have the 
benefit of one of the most facetious and agreeable of ciccrones — 
John Campbell, the excellent and lusty driver of the coach 
through Hell's Glen. 

Another favourite but more circuitous route to In- 
verary is by Arroquhar, at the head of Loch Long, 
reached either by a steamer up the loch, or by crossing 
the short isthmus at Tarbet on Loch Lomond. The 
distance from Arroquhar to Cairndow is fourteen miles. 
Owing to the steep ascent, a stout pedestrian will walk 
it nearly as fast as he can be conveyed by coach ; and it 
will well repay him by the savage sublimity of Glen- 
croe. It is a deep defile, the broadside of Ben Arthur 
or the Cobbler rising on the right with all his coronet 
of fantastic horny precipices. At the climax of the 
ascent, there is a stone placed there by General 
Wade's engineers, who made the road, and inscribed 
with the benevolent recommendation — " Rest and be 
thankful." We ask particular attention to this stone, 
because a friend of ours sojourning in the district, when 
selecting the spot at which it would be most agreeable 
to stop for the night, seeing on the map " Eest and be 
thankful," and deeming this a very comfortable name 
for an inn, resolved to trust himself to its hospitality, 
and remain there all night. His feelings may be ima- 
gined when, at ten o'clock and darkness coming on, he 
fomid, instead of the comfortable inn, a stone.
