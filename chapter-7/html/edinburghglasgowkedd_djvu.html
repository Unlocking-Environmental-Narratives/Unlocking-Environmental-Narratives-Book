THE TROSACHS AND THE LAKES. 



EDINBUKGH AM) GLASGOW TO STIKLESTG. 

Such is the complete state of the arrangements in summer for 
visiting the Trosachs, Loch Katrine, and Loch Lomond, that the 
tourist who can be satisfied with a hasty glance at the diversified 
scenery of the route, may leave Edinburgh or Glasgow in the 
morning, and return on the evening of the same day, after accom- 
plishing the journey at a moderate expense, and with the least 
possible discomfort and fatigue. Starting from Glasgow, the tourist 
has the choice of proceeding by railway to Balloch, thence sailing 
up Loch Lomond to Inversnaid, then crossing the country by 
coach to Loch Katrine, proceeding thence to Callander, where the 
train may be taken either for Glasgow or Edinburgh. Or, pursuing 
the course which will be followed in these pages, the traveller may 
leave Edinburgh or Glasgow by the train which diverges into the 
Scottish Central railway at Greenhill Junction, and proceed by way 
of Stirling to Callander, and thence by coach to the Trosachs and 
the lakes. The objects to be seen along the route are of varied 
interest, and the traveller's enjoyment of much of the scenery 
through which he passes will be in proportion to the leisure he can 
bestow on the survey. Without being limited to the beaten path, 
the following descriptions embrace an excursion occupying several 
days. 

To the stranger proceeding from Edinburgh, the most conspicuous 
object on the way to Greenhill is the town of Linlithgow, with its 
royal Palace, a picturesque ruin, seen to considerable advantage 
from the railway station. The town is of great antiquity; and the 
Palace, which occupies the site of a castle dating as far back as the 



6 LINLITHGOW— NIDDRY-FALKIftK. 

time of David L, was commenced and carried on by his successors. 
A considerable portion of the present quadrangular edifice was built 
under the auspices of James III. James IV., who chose this as 
his favourite residence, built the eastern, and James VI. the northern 
and most modern side of the quadrangle. In the west and more 
ancient side of the Palace was born the ill-fated Mary Queen of 
Scots. The stately edifice retained its integrity till the year 1746, 
when it was burned by Hawley's cowardly dragoons, who were 
quartered in the Palace on the night after their defeat by the army 
of Prince Charles Edward at Falkirk. Before reaching Linlithgow, 
and nigh to the station at Winchburgh, the ruins of Niddry Castle 
are seen high above the deep rocky cutting of the railway. This 
old fortalice gave protection to Mary on the first night after her 
release from Lochleven Castle, and is the scene of some lively inci- 
dents introduced on the occasion in Scott's tale of the "Abbot." 
Falkirk, about a mile from the station to which it gives its name, 
is well-known for its "trysts" or cattle-fairs. The place was the 
scene of a battle fought on the 22 d of July, 1298, in which the 
Scottish army was defeated by the English. "Wallace commanded 
the Scottish spearmen on the occasion, addressing them, on the eve 
of battle, in the remarkable words : — " I have here brought you 
to the ring; dance as ye best can." Sir John the Graham, who 
fell in the battle, is commemorated in the churchyard of Falkirk by 
a monument bearing this inscription : — 

" Mente manuque potens, et Valise fidus Achates, 
Conditur hie Gramus, bello interfectus ab Anglis." 

Thus quaintly done into English, in which form the epitaph has 
long been popularly known — 

" Of mind and courage stout, Wallace's true Achates, 
Here lies Sir John the Graham, felled by the English baties." 

Falkirk muir is celebrated for another battle, in which victory, 
like an expiring lamp, gleamed for the last time upon the arms 
of Prince Charles Edward, before it was quenched on the fatal 
field of Culloden. This second battle of Falkirk was fought on the 
17th of January, 1746. The cloud of smoke hovering over the 
Carse of Falkirk, two miles to the north-west of the town, indicates 
the seat of Carron Foundry, celebrated for the production of cannon 
and all sorts of cast-iron goods. Three miles to the north-west of 
Falkirk, and situated at the junction of the Forth and Clyde Canal 
with the Carron river, is the little sea-port of Grangemouth, chiefly 
frequented by vessels employed in the Baltic trade. 



ROMAN WALL-BANNOCKBURN. 7 

The attention of the stranger journeying from Glasgow to the 
rendezvous at Greenhill may be directed, after passing the Campsie 
Junction station, to the remains (on the left side) of the Roman 
Wall (constructed in the reign of Antoninus Pius, by Lollius 
Urbicus, who assumed the government of Britain in the year 140, 
and retained it for 20 years). This great bulwark extended from 
Dunglass, or West Kilpatrick, on the Clyde, to Carriden, near 
Borrowstoness, on the Forth, through the broad vale now traversed 
by the Union and Forth and Clyde Canal, and by the Edinburgh 
and Glasgow Eailway, these modern works running parallel for many 
miles with the line chosen by the Roman engineers. The continuity 
of the wall is now much interrupted, and large portions of it are 
obliterated. At Castlecary was situated one of the numerous forts 
connected with the wall, and which is crossed at the station by the 
railway. The excavations here revealed some interesting relics of 
the Roman invaders, and quantities of carbonised wheat have been 
from time to time discovered in the recesses of the fort, being, no 
doubt, part of the stores which the Romans were unable to carry 
off, and therefore destroyed, when they relinquished the post. 
The length of tHe wall, from sea to sea, was about 27 English or 
40 Roman miles. 

On diverging, at Greenhill Junction, into the Scottish Central 
line, the first station is that of Larbert, remarkable, in common 
with all the stations on this line (in the Royal Route to the north), 
for the tasteful manner in which it is ornamented with flower-plots. 
Behind Larbert church is the monument, in cast-iron, to Bruce the 
Abyssinian traveller. The railway now traverses the rich alluvial 
land of the Carse of Stirling, highly cultivated, richly wooded, 
and giving evidence in its stately mansions and substantial farm- 
steadings, of opulent proprietors and a prosperous tenantry. On 
approaching the station at Bannockburn, two and a half miles from 
Stirling, a passing view is obtained of the scene of the great battle 
of the 24th of June, 1314, which resulted in the defeat by the 
Scots of the formidable English army commanded by Edward II, 
in securing the independence of Scotland, and in establishing Robert 
the Bruce upon the throne. The traditional names given to several 
parts of the field still commemorate incidents of the day. The 
"Bore-stone" where the Bruce planted his victorious standard is 
the object of many a pilgrimage, and, like the ancient London Stone, 
is religiously preserved under a strong iron railing, a precaution 
rendered necessary by the predatory visits of remorseless relic- 
hunters. The Gillies' Hill, where the array of camp sutlers helped

to increase the panic of the English army, is conspicuous from the 
plain; but the entire scene of "the Marathon of the North" is 
witnessed to better advantage from the ramparts of Stirling Castle. 
The field may be visited from Bannockburn station, or from the 
village of St. Ninian's, about a mile and a half from Stirling. 

Stirling, as a centre of picturesque beauty and historical interest 
which is nowhere surpassed in Scotland, is worthy of a more detailed 
notice than can be accorded to it in the present narrow limits. 
No better site could have been selected either for a fortress or a 
royal residence, and at an early period Stirling was celebrated for 
both. The proximity of the Castle to the lower fords of the Forth 
early gave it the command of that river; and Stirling held the 
tete de pont between the Highlands and the Lowlands during the 
age when it was a common saying that " the Forth bridles the wild 
Highlander." The Castle is built upon one of three isolated hills of 
trap rock on the outskirts of the great coal-field, rising abruptly 
through the alluvial plain or carse, which gives unequivocal tokens 
of having formed the upper reach of the Frith of Forth at no remote 
geological period.* It is probable that the hill now surmounted 
by the Castle, the wooded height of Craigforth, and the Abbey Craig, 
were at that time islets overlooking the waters of the ample frith. 
They all consist of a prismatic greenstone or dolorite, overlying 
sandstone. Macculloch was the first to point out, on the northern 
precipice of the Castle-hill, an interesting section of the igneous and 
stratified rocks, where the greenstone is seen, at one place, to be in 
contact with clay-slate, and in another to penetrate and dislocate 
the sandstone strata, the stratified masses in each instance exhibit- 
ing the usual effects of contact with igneous rocks in a state of 
fusion. The Castle-rock, the Abbey Craig, and Craigforth, like 
Edinburgh Castle and Calton Hill, present their precipitous faces 
in a north-westerly direction, and decline gradually towards the 
east. They are all examples of the phenomenon of " crag and tail," 
their peculiar conformation being ascribed by geologists to the 
action of a prolonged current of water flowing from the north-west 



* The " Statistical Account" of the parish of Logie mentions the discovery, in 
1819, of the entire skeleton of a whale, in the progress of some draining operations 
on the estate of Airthrey, near to the north verge of the alluvial deposit of the Forth. 
The bones were imbedded in blue silt, at a height of 22 feet above the present 
highest stream-tides of the river, immediately opposite. The bones are preserved 
in the Natural History Museum of Edinburgh University. The same deposit 
which contained the cetacean remains yielded recent marine shells, and may 
therefore be regarded as part of the raised beach, traceable in forms of a more or 
less terraced description, and of varying heights, on all our sea-coasts. 



STIRLING CASTLE. 9 

to the south-east, and denuding the surface of the earth in its 
course, before the elevation of the land to its present height above 
the sea.* 

It is not known when the Castle was founded. From its being 
under the protection of the fortress, the town had acquired some 
importance so early as the middle of the twelfth century, when it 
was erected into a royal burgh by David I. In Stirling Castle, 
James II. and James IV. were born ; James V. and Queen Mary were 
crowned; and James VI. spent his early years while receiving the 
instructions of George Buchanan, "which (remarks Dr. Jamieson), 
if they could not make him a wise man, inspired him at least with 
a taste for learning." It was a favourite residence of the Stuarts, 
by whom most of the existing structures were erected. These form 
a small quadrangle, consisting of the Parliament Hall, built by James 
III., the Palace by James V., and the Chapel, now the Armoury, by 
James VI. In an apartment, destroyed some years since by fire, 
and known as .the Douglas room, James II. mortally stabbed 
William, Earl of Douglas, in 1452, after having invited him as a 
guest, and given him a safe-conduct. Mary occasionally resorted to 
the Castle after her return from Prance : her first visit was on the 
13th of September, 1561, and her last was in April, 1567, to see' 
her infant son James VI, when she was abducted by Both well, 
while returning to Edinburgh, and carried to Dunbar Castle, of 
which he was governor. Immediately under the Castle, but still on 
the lofty ground of the Castle-hill, is a level inclosure of about an 
acre in extent, called the Valley, where, in its days of regal splendour, 
rival knights encountered each other in joust and tournament, and 
combats of a more sanguinary nature were sometimes witnessed. 
The small rocky eminence on the edge of the hill, and commanding 
a view of the Valley, is called the Ladies' Hill, and is said to be the 
eminence where the feats of chivalry were viewed by the beauties of 
the court and castle. Within the space once occupied as the royal 
gardens, is a mound in the form of a plateau, known as the King's 
Knot, or King Arthur's Pound Table, also once the scene of 
chivalrous pastimes. A mound to the north of the Castle, is known 
as the Gallow Hill, where, in 1425, Duncan Earl of Lennox, 
Murdock Duke of Albany, and Walter and Alexander his sons, were 



* In the progress of some excavations connected with the erection of a monu- 
ment to the martyrs, in the Cemetery, the grounds of which form part of the 
talus of the Castle-hill, the rock, laid bare for the first time, exhibited the rounded 
forms and the grooved and striated surfaces now generally assigned to glacial or 
diluvial action.

beheaded for high treason. " This heading hill, as it was some- 
timea termed," says Sir Walter Scott, "bears commonly the less 
terrible name of Hurley -hacket, from its having been the scene of a 
courtly amusement alluded to by Sir David Lindsay, who says of 
the pastimes in which the young king was engaged, 'some harled 
him to the Hurley-hacket ; ' which consisted in sliding in some sort 
of chair, it may be supposed, from top to bottom of a smooth bank."* 
l hi the north-east of the Castle there is a steep path leading up to 
the town, called the Pass of Eallengeich, the name of which was 
assumed by James V., when he was accustomed to ramble through 
the country in disguise. The vagaries of the " Goodman of Ballen- 
geich" are celebrated in the well-known ancient ballads of "The 
Gaberlunzie Man," and " We'll gae nae mair a-roving," the latter 
eharacterised by Scott as perhaps the best comic ballad in any 
language. 

The view from the ramparts of the Castle is of the most varied 
and magnificent description. The Links of the Forth, the name 
given to the serpentine meanderings of the river, form a striking 
and singular feature of the Carse of Stirling. These graceful 
windings are so often repeated in the course of the stream, as to 
extend the distance of six miles by land to twenty miles by water. 
In one of the peninsulas formed by the curvatures of the river, 
stands the tower of the ancient Abbey of Cambuskenneth. It was 
one of the religious houses founded and richly endowed by King 
David I., a monarch whose grants of lands out of the royal patri- 
mony to the monastic institutions, obtained for him, along with his 
personal qualities, the title of Saint David, and a place in the 
catalogue of holy persons ; although one of his successors, who held 
a different opinion of his liberalities, said of him, that " St. David 
had proved a sair saunt (sore saint) for the Crown." The Forth is 
navigable up to Stirling by vessels of seventy or eighty tons 
burthen; but it has been observed that "it is the only navigable 
river in Europe, perhaps, where the vessel, if depending on its sails 
alone to reach its destination, would, in the space of a few miles, 
require wind from every point of the compass." The sinuous 
movements performed by these vessels in tacking, is not the least 
enlivening of the features of this peculiar scene. The view 
towards the east sweeps over a spacious champaign, nearly eighty 

* There are distinct traces on this mound of its having been fortified. The 
lines bear some resemblance to those of vitrified forts; and on a slight examination 
of the debris, several pieces of artificially fused trap, with the characteristic vesicular 
and lava-like texture, were detected. 



VIEW FROM THE CASTLE-WALLACE MONUMENT. 1 1 

miles in length and eighteen in breadth, and remarkably rich in 
verdant meadows, cultivated land, and luxuriant green-woods. 
Alloa and Clackmannan are seen to the left, where the view is 
bounded by the range of the Ochils. Stretching over the expanse 
of the Lothians, the eye readily descries the heights of Edinburgh 
Castle in ordinarily clear weather. Falkirk and its carse fill up 
the middle distance. The Campsie hills close the horizon on the 
south. The vale of Menteith lies to the west, bounded by the 
screen of lofty mountains encircling the lakes, and constituting the 
frontier of the Highlands. Ben Lomond and Benledi are the most 
conspicuous of the group ; Benvenue and Ben-an appear in the back- 
ground. The field of Bannockburn lies fully exposed to view from 
the Castle ramparts ; and the Castle itself nowhere presents a more 
imposing appearance than when seen from the battlefield. The 
struggle for possession of the Castle brought on the conflict in its 
neighbourhood, which issued in repelling the English invasion and 
vindicating the independence of Scotland. The patriotic senti- 
ment which has been fostered for five centuries and a half by 
the recollections of Bannockburn, celebrated in song and story, has 
recently been embodied in the monument to the fame of Sir 
William Wallace, surmounting the Abbey Craig, and forming a 
conspicuous object in the landscape.* Wallace, who, after the 

* THE NATIONAL WALLACE MONUMENT. 
The monument in progress of erection (1863) on the Abhey Craig, near Stirling, 
(from a design by John T. Rochead, Esq., Architect, Glasgow,) consists of 
a lofty and imposing Scottish Baronial Tower, upwards of 200 feet high, divided 
and staged off as follows: — A basement of 60 feet square by 20 feet high, after 
which the square of the tower is maintained at nearly 40 feet square to the height 
of 130 feet, and there terminated by an open and lofty stone crown of over 50 feet 
of altitude. The walls of the tower are thick and massive in construction, of not 
less than 15 feet thick at the base, and graduating from 7 to 5 feet at the top. 
The masonry is of a strong and enduring description, concreted with thin hot lime, 
hardening the whole into a solid mass as in the examples of mediaeval architecture. 
At the east side of the tower is the keeper's house, between which and the 
monument is an open court yard, entered by a massive, circular-arched gateway, 
having bold mouldings characteristic of the Scottish Baronial style, above which is 
placed the heraldic arms of Sir William Wallace. Passing through the gateway 
into a stone arched passage, a straight flight of steps, set in the thickness of the 
wall, leads to an open octagon winding staircase, the walls of which are of solid 
ashlar work, projecting from the south-west angle of the tower, and running up 
nearly its entire height. The walls of the staircase, raking with the stair, are 
pierced with arrowlet slits or lights continuously in each flight of steps to the 
summit of the square tower. Externally the walls of the staircase are bound about 
with imitation rope work, with bold moulded angles. The handrail is wrought 
out of the solid newal. This staircase conducts to several spacious and lofty halls, 
the ceilings and floors of which are fire-proof, being arched with brick, having the 
floors laid with mosaic tiles. It is proposed to set apart these several rooms as 
visitors' and reliquary rooms or museums for the reception of old armour and other 
antiquarian relics illustrative of early Scottish history; and, should the funds permit,

defeat at Falkirk, resigned Ms office of Guardian of Scotland, 
continued to maintain his country's cause for seven years at the 
head of a small band of followers; and even for a year after all the 
rest of Scotland's defenders had laid down their arms, his constancy 
remained unshaken. At length he was taken prisoner, and betrayed 
by Sir John Menteith, a Scottish noble, to the English, by whom 
he was put to death in London, as a traitor to Edward, in the year 
1305, nine years before the courage of Bruce achieved the victory 
over tyranny and usurpation, for which Wallace had prepared his 
country by his glorious example of heroic bravery and devoted 
patriotism. 

The Castle surrendered in 1651 to the troops of Oliver Cromwell, 
commanded by General Monk, who reduced the fortress by erecting 
his batteries on the tower of the church and in the adjoining 
burying-ground. The walls were repaired in 1 745, in anticipation 
of the Castle being menaced by the Highlanders. Prince Charles 
took possession of the town in 1746, after the fight of Ealkirk, and 
had invested the Castle and constructed a battery upon the Gowlan- 
hill, when he was compelled to raise the siege and retreat to the north, 
by the approach of the Duke of Cumberland. Queen Victoria and 
the late Prince Consort visited and minutely inspected the Castle in 
1842, in the royal progress to Taymouth. 

Amongst the attractions of Stirling, the Castle-wynd, with its 
quaint architecture and its air of antique grandeur, will not escape 

an appropriate marble statue of the illustrious patriot will be placed in the upper- 
most gallery or hall. The apex of the monument exhibits the form of an imperial 
open crown of stone, of much grace and beauty, at once forming a most appropriate 
and graceful termination to the whole monument, and which cannot fail to present 
a most commanding outline and graceful feature when seen against the open sky. 
The coronal top or crown is upwards of 50 feet high, and consists of eight arms, 
four springing from the angles of the tower and four from the sides, all converging 
and abutting on the centre upon an open newal staircase, and forming a series ot 
flying buttresses, broadly ribbed, having the spandrils richly filled in with open 
tracery. The outer raking flanks of the buttresses are surmounted with massive 
crocketed pinnacles, the tout ensemble of which imparts a pleasing lightness and 
impressive monumental effect to the whole design. The site is one of surpassing 
beauty, and from the monument will be had magnificent views of the wide and 
extensive plain. The estimated cost of the monument is between £7,000 and 
£8,000. 

The monument is founded upon the site of a Vitrified Fort, some remains of 
which may be seen near the summit of the Craig, and will no doubt be carefully 
preserved. The Abbey Craig, as has been already stated, consists of trap rock, 
rising through the sandstone of the coal formation. The sandstone quarry 
excavated in the rocks abutting upon the western side of the Craig, furnished a 
considerable portion of the building material for the monument; and at the time 
of the writer's visit several fine specimens of Sigillaria, with their branching 
rhizomes or root-stocks (Stigmaria) attached, were laid bare, some of which were 
transferred to Messrs. Drummonds' Museum in Stirling. 



STIRLING— ANTIQUITIES-BOTANY. 13 

observation. Argyle's Lodging is situated on the north side of the 
Castle-wynd, and with its pinnacled round towers and decorated 
windows affords a good example of the French style of castellated 
architecture which in ancient times was much in vogue in Scotland. 
The house had various proprietors, and at length fell into the hands 
of the Argyle family. The Duke of Argyle had his head-quarters 
here during the insurrection of 1715. A modern building opposite 
occupies the site of the house inhabited by George Buchanan 
during the minority of James VI. The ruinous structure named 
Mar's Work was built in 1570, by the Eegent Earl of Mar, out of 
the wreck of Cambuskenneth Abbey, the carved stones of which 
are here employed to decorate a structure very different from that 
of their original destination. The edifice was intended for the 
palace of the Eegent, who was hereditary governor of the Castle, 
but it was never completed. The gothic church beside it was built 
by James IV., the chancel having been added by Cardinal Beaton. 
In this church James VI. was crowned, when he was thirteen 
months old, on which occasion John Knox preached the coronation 
sermon. In the Castle, as has been already mentioned, the youth- 
ful monarch received his education, and here he held his first 
Parliament in 1578. Every ancient edifice in the Castle and the 
burgh has its legend connected with the civil or the ecclesiastical 
history of Scotland, with which no other town except Edinburgh is so 
intimately associated, or possesses so profound an interest to the 
antiquarian. The thriving modern town abounds with attractions 
of various descriptions (including Drummonds' Agricultural Museum) 
which will repay the attention of the stranger. The Cemetery, on 
the south side of the Castle-hill, is tastefully laid out, and is 
remarkable for the number of its monuments commemorative of 
the religious Eeformers and Martyrs of Scotland. The roads and 
pathways constructed round the Castle-hill afford a variety of 
secluded rural walks, which command views of the entire panorama 
of the carse.* 

* The following are amongst the plants found on Stirling Castle-hill: — The 
walls of the Castle and of Mar's Work produce the Wallflower (Cheiranthus 
Cheiri) in luxuriance; Lamium album is very abundant on the rock and all around 
Stirling, although not of frequent occurrence in the neighbourhood of Glasgow; 
Atropa Belladonna is probably an escape from the Castle garden, where it was 
atone time cultivated; Hyoscyamusniger; Aquilegia vulgaris; Coniummaculatum; 
iEthusa Cynapium; Petroselinum sativum; Smyrnium Olusatrum; Myrrhis

Convolvulus arvensis. 



"U DUMBLANE-SHERIFFMUIR. 

The Bridge op Allan, a delightful little village situated upon 
the river Allan, and much frequented on account of the neighbour- 
ing saline spring of Airthrey, is three miles distant from Stirling, 
with which there is constant intercourse by means of railway and 
omnibus. The principal seats in the vicinity are Airthrey Castle 
(Lord Abercromby), Keir (William Stirling, Esq.), Kippenross 
(John Stirling, Esq.), and Westerton Park. 

Dunblane or Dumblane (Perthshire) is two miles from Bridge 
of Allan. Like that village it occupies a pleasant position on the 
Allan, and derives its chief interest from the remains of an ancient 
cathedral, which was founded by David I., about the middle of the 
twelfth century. The nave is 130 feet by 58; the choir, serving 
as the parish church, is 80 feet by 30, the latter being of more 
recent date than the former. The last bishop of the see was the 
devout and gentle Eobert Leighton, afterwards translated to the see 
of Glasgow, who resigned his episcopal office in consequence of the 
persecution of the Presbyterians in the reign of Charles II., and 
bequeathed his library to the clergy of the diocese of Dunblane, 
with funds for its support. After the re-establishment of Presby- 
tery, the library was placed under trustees, including some of the 
neighbouring country gentlemen, and several ministers of the Pres- 
bytery of the bounds, whose successors still continue to superintend 
it. The collection consists principally of classical authors and 
theological writings of the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. 

Sheriffmuir, the scene of the battle fought between the Earl of 
Mar's insurgent followers and the royal troops under the Duke of 
Argyle, in 1715, may be visited from Dunblane, from which it is 
distant about three miles to the north-east. The battle-field is a 
bleak moor, now partly covered with a plantation of fir-trees. The 
place is indicated by a stone railed round and called by the country 
people " the battle stone." The Earl of Mar broke up his head 
quarters at Perth, on the 10th of November, and commenced his 
march southward at the head of a powerful army, containing the 
flower of the Highland Clans, which had zealously espoused the 
cause of the Pretender. It was the design of their leader to 
penetrate into the Lowlands by crossing the fords of the Eorth. 
The Duke of Argyle, whose headquarters were at Stirling, resolved 
to anticipate this movement, and conveyed his army across the 
river at Stirling Bridge, on the 12th, prepared, with a considerably 
smaller number of troops, to dispute the passage of the insurgents. 
On the 13th (Sunday) the hostile armies found themselves within 
a short distance of each other, on a declivity of the Ochils. The 



BATTLE OF SHERIFFMUIR. 1 5 

royal troops, somewhat less than four thousand in number, were 
drawn up between Dunblane and Sheriffniuir, the right wing com- 
manded by Argyle, the left by General Witham. A height lay 
between the two armies, concealing them from each other. Both 
armies were ascending this eminence in column at the same time, 
and met unexpectedly at the top, where some confusion and delay 
were occasioned to each in forming line of battle. It was in these 
circumstances that an old Highland chief, who knew how much 
depended upon the suddenness and impetuosity of the attack, 
uttered the memorable wish, " Oh, for one hour of Dundee!" The 
Highlanders made a fierce onslaught on the left of the royalists, 
who received the shock with steadiness, and with a heavy fire which 
did considerable execution amongst the assailants. The fall of the 
young chief of Clan Eanald "checked (says Sir Walter Scott,) for 
an instant the impetuosity of his followers, when Glengarry started 
from the ranks, waved his bonnet around his head, exclaiming, 
* Revenge, revenge! to-day for revenge, and to-morrow for 
mourning!'" Under the impulse of this animating appeal, the 
clansmen threw themselves upon the foe with irresistible energy, 
dispersing the left of Argyle's line, and routing them with slaughter. 
Very different was the event of the conflict on the right division 
and centre of the royalists, who withstood and rolled back the 
assault of the Highlanders with invincible courage, so that Mar's 
left wing and his whole second line were put to flight, although 
consisting of a number equal to that of Argyle's entire force. 
Witham fled with his discomfited followers at full gallop to Stirling, 
carrying the news of his defeat, the victorious Highlanders not 
thinking it worth their while to pursue the fugitives. The Duke, 
on the other hand, pressed on the Highlanders as they fled towards 
the banks of Allan water, a distance of about three miles, within 
which space the retreating insurgents rallied no less than ten times. 
At length, Argyle retired to Dunblane and Mar to Ardoch, both 
generals claiming the victory, yet neither in a position to turn it to 
advantage.* The peculiarity of this remarkable conflict consisted in 
the right division of each army defeating the left division of the 
other, giving rise to the humorous description of the satirical song 
with which the battle of Sheriflmuir is indissolubly associated : — 

* Several small mounds are pointed out on the heath as the burial-places of the 
jlain. Three of these occur near that part of the plantation which contains the 
" battle-stone." The preservation of this venerable monument is due to Mr. Stirling 
of Kippendavy, who has inclosed it in an iron cage, inscribed as the " Gathering- 
stone of the Highlanders." Strangers in quest of the spot would be greatly aided by the 
restoration of the lofty pole by which the position of the stone was formerly indicated. 



1 6 CASTLE OF DOUNE. 

" There's some say that we wan, 

Some say that they wan, 

Some say that nane wan at a', man ; 

But ae thing I'm sure, 

That at Sheriffmuir, 

A battle there was, which I saw, man; 

And we ran, and they ran, 

And they ran, and we ran, 

And we ran, and they ran awa, man."* 
Doune, at a distance of nine miles from Stirling, and four miles 
from Dunblane, with which it is connected by railway, is situated 
on the river Teith, and the ruins of its fine old Castle render the 
place a favourite resort of strangers. This imposing edifice occupies 
a commanding position upon an eminence overlooking the river, at 
a point where it is joined by a small mountain stream. The 
remains of a moat are still traceable on the landward side. From 
the summit, the eye ranges over the cultivated fields and rich 
woodlands extending from Stirling to the vale of Menteith, where 
the lowlands are bounded by the noble screen of hills of which 
Ben Lomond, Benledi, Benmore, and Ben Voirlich are the most 
conspicuous. 

The reputed founder of the Castle was Murdock Duke of Albany, 
who, as already stated, was beheaded on the "heading hill" of Stirling, 

* Several of the clansmen present on this occasion evinced, for various reasons, 
a reluctance to fight; amongst others Rob Roy, a dependent of the Duke of 
Argyle's, and, although marching under the standard of Mar, more than suspected 
of communicating information from the Jacobite camp to his superior. Sir W. 
Scott, in the " Tales of a Grandfather," narrates an anecdote of the outlaw too 
characteristic to be passed over. A strong party of the MacGregors and Mac- 
Phersons were under the command of Rob Roy, who when ordered to charge, 
replied coolly, " If they cannot do it without me, they cannot do it with me." 
"Allister MacPherson, who followed Rob Roy's original profession of a drover, 
impatient at the inactivity in which they were detained, threw off his plaid, drew 
his sword, and called on the MacPhersons to follow. ' Hold, Sandy,' said Rob 
Roy, ' were the question about a drove of sheep, you might know something; 
but as it concerns the leading of men, it is for me to decide.' ' Were the question 
about a drove of Glenangus wethers,' retorted the MacPherson, 'the question with 
you, Rob, would not be who should be last, but who should be first.' This had 
almost produced a battle between the two champions; but in the meantime the 
opportunity of advancing was lost." In his introduction to the novel of Rob Roy, 
Sir Walter mentions that on this occasion Rob did not neglect his private interest, 
the confusion of an undecided battle affording him an opportunity of enriching his 
followers by plundering the baggage and the dead on both sides. The conduct 
of the outlaw on the occasion is stigmatised in the song quoted above : — 
" Rob Roy he stood watch 

On a hill for to catch 

The booty, for aught that I saw, man." 

For he ne'er advanced 

From the place he was stanced 

Till nae mair was to do there at a', man." 



CASTLE OF DOUNE. 1 ^ 

within view of the towers of Donne; but it probably dates from an 
earlier period, and judging from the massiveness of its remains, it 
belongs to the first order of Scottish fortresses, of which those of 
Edinburgh, Stirling, and Dumbarton afford entire specimens. The 
ruin consists of a huge quadrangular structure, the walls of which are 
about forty feet high and ten feet thick, together with a spacious 
square tower, the remains of which are 100 feet high. The principal 
hall is 70 feet long; an apartment in the large tower is 45 by 30 
feet. The kitchen fire-place is sufficiently ample to have afforded 
room for a considerable body of retainers. Many of the stones in 
the interior will be observed still to retain the " mason's mark." The 
Castle was the occasional residence of the dowager Queen Margaret, 
widow of James IV., and of her hapless grand-daughter Mary. It 
has long been the property of the Earls of Moray, whose eldest son 
derives from it the title of Lord Doune. The fortress is roofless, but 
was in a tolerable state of repair in 1745, when it was garrisoned by 
Prince Charles Edward during his temporary ascendancy in Scotland, 
and placed under the command of Stewart of Balloch. Some of 
the prisoners taken by the Chevalier's army at the battle of Ealkirk 
were transferred to this fortress. Amongst the number was Home, 
the author of "Douglas," and historian of the Eebellion, who 
contrived a daring and successful expedient for their escape. 
Balked in the hope of achieving their liberty by force, it was 
agreed that they should twist their blankets into a rope, and thus 
descend from the battlements to the ground. The order of their 
descent having been decided by drawing lots, they went up to the 
battlements, and about one o'clock, favoured by moonlight, began 
the perilous experiment. The first four got down without much 
difficulty; with the fifth, a tall and bulky man, the rope broke just 
as his feet reached the ground. The next in order, one Barrow, an 
Englishman, was cautioned against trusting to the rope, now shorn 
of its length by twenty or thirty feet, but he, nevertheless, resolved 
to take advantage of what remained, and sliding down to its extre- 
mity, he dropped, and although his fall was broken by the friendly 
efforts of his companions below, he dislocated an ankle and broke 
several of his ribs. Hopping along upon one leg, with the aid of 
two others of the company, he made sure his escape. Niel Mac Vicar, 
who had drawn the last number, on seeing the disaster of his 
friends, betook himself to his cell with the rope, which he hastily 
repaired and lengthened; a precaution, however, which proved 
abortive ; for having too much increased the thickness of the rope at 
its fractured part, he found it on descending to be beyond his grasp,

and dropped from the same height as Barrow had done, bnt with 
no one below to break his fall. The injuries he received were so 
serious, that he languished and died soon after, at the house of his 
lather, a clergyman in Islay. Next morning the Highlanders made 
active but ineffectual efforts to recover their prisoners. Scott was 
told by an old gentleman that he remembered seeing the commander 
Stewart scouring the country in haste and excitement in quest of 
the fugitives. The reader of "Waverley" will be pleasantly 
reminded that Sir "Walter has his English hero conveyed to this 
grand old castle by his Highland captors. 

The old bridge spanning the Teith, according to an inscription, 
much effaced, impannelled in the right-hand parapet, was built in 
1535, by Eobert Spitell, tailor to Margaret Queen of James IV. 
In a heraldic device, a large pair of scissors appears en saltier. The 
cotton-works of Deanston, in the immediate neighbourhood, have 
long exercised a beneficial influence on the condition of the inhabi- 
tants of tliis parish (Kilmadock), and will always be associated with 
the name of Mr. James Smith, for many years their manager, and 
better known as the active promoter of scientific agriculture. Doune 
Lodge, formerly named Cambus- Wallace, a mansion of the Earl of 
Moray's, lies about a mile to the north-west; and three miles west- 
ward of Doune is situated Lanrick Castle ; beyond which is Cambus- 
more, where Sir Walter Scott spent some of his youthful days, and 
no doubt acquired that intimate knowledge of the country which 
was so readily recalled when describing the ride of Fitz- James from 
Loch Vennachar to Stirling, after the combat with Eoderick Dhu. 
" I had (he says) read a great deal, seen much, and heard more, of 
that romantic country, where I was in the habit of spending some 
time every autumn ; and the scenery of Loch Katrine was connected 
with the recollection of many a dear friend and merry expedition of 
former days." The accuracy of Sir Walter's descriptions cannot be 
surpassed; and the best of all companions on the present route is a 
pocket-copy of " The Lady of the Lake." 

Callander, sixteen and a half miles from Stirling, is a substantial 
little town, greatly more Lowland than Highland in its aspect, 
provided with ample accommodation for summer sojourners and 
tourists, and offering not a few attractions in its neighbourhood. 
From this place the traveller can proceed at once to the lakes by 
coach, or may take his way up the Pass of Leny and visit Eob Eoy's 
country, or make an excursion to the district of Menteith, and visit 
Inchmahome and Loch Ard, to which we propose presently to con- 
duct him. Callander is situated upon the river Teith, which winds

FALLS OF BRACKLIN— BENLEDI, ITS GEOLOGY AND BOTANY. 19 

slowly through the valley, as if lingering on the border of its native 
Highlands, before entering upon its rapid descent towards the 
Forth. The river originates in the confluence of two little streams to 
the westward of the village, the one issuing from Loch Lubnaig and 
the other from Loch Vennachar. About a mile and a half to the 
north-east, a stream named the Kelty plunges through a rocky and 
wooded defile, forming a series of cascades and rapids known as the 
Falls of Bracklin. A rustic bridge is thrown across the chasm at 
a dizzy height above the torrent, where it leaps over a precipice fifty 
feet high. The rocks consist of old red sandstone, which also forms 
the mural precipices to the west of the town. Benledi rises in graceful 
magnificence between the Teith and its tributary the Lubnaig, and 
reaching a height of 2381 feet, exalts itself broad and blue over the 
expanse of hill and dale. As Callander is peculiarly a frontier 
village, not altogether Lowland nor yet with much of a Highland 
character, so Benledi belongs only in part to the alpine system of 
rocks developed to the west and north. It lies on the junction of 
the mica-slate (the rock which constitutes the most picturesque 
scenery of the Highlands of Perthshire,) with the band of clay-slate 
which stretches from Stonehaven to the frith of Clyde, forming a 
narrow border to the gradually expanding strata of the former 
system. Benledi is described, therefore, as being a true mica-slate 
on the north-west, and clay-slate on the south-east declivity.* The 
whole of these rocks, it is proper to mention here, are assigned to 
the Silurian system by Sir Eoderick I. Murchison and Mr. Geikie. 
The name Benledi is a contraction of Beinn-le-Dia, the Gaelic for 
Hill of God. According to local tradition, the worship of Bel or 
Baal was celebrated on the mountain in ancient times; and even 
within a comparatively recent period the young people of the district 
were accustomed to assemble on Benledi on the first of May, and 
perform certain Beltane rites, the lingering remains of the old 
superstition. 



* The best plants are found on the mica-slate soil of the hill. Amongst the 
more interesting are the following: — Thalictrum alpinum, Draba incana, Silene 
acaulis, Alchemilla alpina, Rubus saxatilis, R. Chamasmorus, Sibbaldia procumbens, 
Epilobium alpinum, Sedum anglicum, Saxifraga akoides, S. hypnoides, S. nivalis, 
S. oppositifolia, S. stellaris, Meum athamanticum, Cornus suecica, Antennaria dioica, 
Hieracium alpinum, Saussurea alpina, Vaccinium uliginosum, V. Vitis-idaaa, 
Armeria maritima, Oxyria reniformis, Polygonum viviparum, Salix herbacea, 
Gymnadenia albida, Habenaria chlorantha, Listera cordata, Tofieldia palustris, 
Juncus supinus, J. triglumis, J. trifidus, Rhyncospora alba, Carex rigida, Poa 
montana; and the following Ferns — Botrychium Lunaria, Allosorus crispus, 
Asplenium viride, Hymenophyllum Wilsoni. In Loch Lubnaig, Isoetes lacustris, 
Lobelia Dortmanna, and Subularia aquatica occur. 



20 PORT AND LAKE OF MENTEITH. 

LAKE OF MENTEITH AND INCHMAHOME. 

From Callander to the Lake of Menteith is a distance of between 
five and six miles; the intermediate country is not of a remark- 
able character. The Port of Menteith is about four miles from the 
Cardioss station of the Forth and Clyde Junction Railway. In the 
village there is a comfortable inn. From the village of Port, a 
good road conducts to Aberfoil, about five miles distant, and thence 
to the foot of Loch Ard is two miles, and to the head, three miles 
farther, making altogether about fifteen miles from Callander. We 
shall subsequently indicate an agreeable walk across the country 
from Loch Achray to Aberfoil and Loch Ard. 

The island of Inchmahome (spelt in old writings Inschemachame 
and Inchmahomo, and signifying " Isle of Rest"), consists of about 
five acres of irregular surface, covered with a wilderness of forest 
and fruit trees, interspersed with copsewood, and embosoming the 
picturesque ruins of an ancient Priory. Contiguous to Inchmahome 
lies the lesser island of Talla, also profusely wooded, and containing 
the moss-grown walls of one of the seats of the Earls of Menteith 
in olden times. The situation of the two islands, except at a 
peninsula on the south, is at a considerable distance from the shore 
of the lake ; they are accessible by a boat, obtained from the inn- 
keeper at the village of Port, a name derived, no doubt, from this 
having been in early times the principal landing place of the 
monastic inhabitants of Inchmahome, and the warlike possessors 
of Talla. The islands are the property of the Duke of Montrose, 
and are under the charge of Colonel Erskine of Cardross. The 
lake is for the most part shallow, but in some places suddenly 
acquires a depth varying, according to soundings, from 46 feet on 
the shore of Rednock, to 88 feet between Inchmahome and the 
northern shore. The lake abounds with perch, trout, and pike, 
and its shores are frequented by the wild duck and diver. Its 
level is only about 15 feet above high-tide mark in the river Forth, 
into which it sends the sluggish stream of the Guidie. The east 
end of the lake, comprising part of the estate of Rednock, is richly 
decorated with modern plantations ; and on the northern shore, the 
ancient pleasure-grounds of the Menteiths are still pointed out by 
the stately trees which adorn the slopes of Coldon and the parks of 
Portend. The general aspect of the lake of Menteith may appear 
tame to the eye which has recently scanned the rugged grandeur of 
the lochs on the other side of the Highland frontier; but its 
winding and wooded shores, and ample expanse of water, and the 
two lonely islets reposing on its unruffled surface, combine to form 



INCHMAHOME AND THE PRIOR Y. 21 

a scene of tranquil beauty peculiarly its own. The effect of this 
charming landscape is enhanced when viewed from an elevated 
point, as in ascending the road towards Callander, where the lake 
forms the foreground, the islets merge into the middle distance, 
embracing the mansion-house of Gartmore and the surrounding 
woods, while the noble summit of Ben Lomond and the neighbour- 
ing heights close in the background. Apart from the pictorial 
situation of Inchmahome, which would alone render it worthy of 
the tourist's attention, its archaeological interest and early associa- 
tions will justify the introduction here of some details of its history 
It appears from ancient ecclesiastical records, that the little island 
of Inchmahome became an early settlement of some religious 
recluses, probably in the time of the Culdees. In a tabular list of 
monasteries, deposited in the Advocates' Library, the island is 
designated "Insula St. Colmoci," and is set down with Cambus- 
kenneth as belonging to the order of St. Augustine. That this 
settlement was founded before the year 1332, to which period it 
had been assigned, is inferred by Spottiswood from a statement 
in Prynne's Collections, " that Adam Prior de l'lsle de St. Colmock 
swore fealty to Edward I. in the year 1296," — St. Colmock's isle 
being considered by antiquarian authors identical with " Inchma- 
homo." The ecclesiastical buildings on the island were erected in 
obedience to a mandate of the Pope, granted, in the year 1238, to 
Walter Cumyng, Earl of Menteith. The Pope's mandate to this 
effect is still preserved, and a translation of it, as well as a copy of 
the original, is contained, along with other interesting antiquarian 
matter concerning the Priory of Inchmahome, in a volume written 
by the late Eev. W. Macgregor Stirling of Port. The Priory was 
embraced in the diocese of Dunblane, the Bishop of which formally 
renounces in the deed all claim upon the revenues of the churches 
in the earldom of Menteith ; whereupon the instrument proceeds : — 
" We have also ordained, that it shall be lawful for the said earl 
and his successors to build a house for religious men of the order 
of St. Augustine, in the island of Inchmaquhomok, without impedi- 
ment or opposition from the said bishop or his successors. And, 
moreover, in conformity with the collation of the said earl, and 
with the will and assent of the said bishop, we have assigned, in 
pure and perpetual alms, to these religious men serving God in the 
said island, the churches of Leny, and of the said island, with all 
the liberties and easements belonging to the said churches, reserving 
his episcopal rights to the said bishop and his successors." There 
were at least four chapels in the adjoining country dependent upon 



22 MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS AT LNC1IMA1IOME. 

the Priory. The island was visited, in 1310, by Kobert the Bruce, 
as appears from a writ given under his hand at that place, on the 
10th of April, forfeiting the estate of John de Pollox as a traitor 
and adherent of the king's enemies. The Priory was united by 
James IV. to his royal chapel of Stirling; but was subsequently 
separated from this chapel and bestowed by James V. upon John 
Lord Erskine, who became Commendatory Prior, and was one of 
the four guardians of the infant Queen Mary. 

A peculiar interest attaches to Inchmahome from its having 
afforded a temporary refuge to Mary Queen of Scots at a critical 
period of her early career. Henry VIII. had formed the plan of 
uniting the kingdoms of England and Scotland, by contracting a 
marriage between the infant Mary and his son Edward VI., then 
also a child. Henry's first aim was to obtain possession of the 
infant Queen, failing in which, and meeting with other obstacles 
to the projected match, the king took bis revenge on Scotland by 
sending a hostile expedition into the Frith of Eorth to burn the 
capital, while an army was commissioned to lay waste the border 
territory between the two countries. The English army was 
defeated by the Scots, at the battle of Ancram-moor, or Lillyard's- 
edge, fought in 1545. On the death of Henry, the same violent 
measures were followed by the Lord Protector Somerset, to compel 
the Scots to surrender their young Queen. Somerset advanced 
into Scotland at the head of a powerful army, supported by ships 
of war ; and vanquished the Scots in the battle of Pinkie, which 
was fought on 10th September, 1547. The object of Henry's 
policy and Somerset's expedition, however, was frustrated by a 
decisive step on the part of the Scottish, nation. Alarmed by the 
disastrous defeat of Pinkie, the guardians of the youthful Queen 
resolved to prevent the possibility of her union with Edward, by 
marrying her to the eldest son of the King of France, and sending 
her to be educated at the French Court. Mary embarked at Dum- 
barton on board a French galley, in the month of August, 1548. 
It was during the period which elapsed betwixt the battle of Pinkie 
and the last day of February following, that the youthful Queen, 
then in her sixth year, found protection and repose in the seques- 
tered islet of Inchmahome, where she was committed to the joint 
care of Lords Erskine and Livingston. She was accompanied in 
this retreat, and during her thirteen years' residence in France, by 
four young ladies of rank, of her own age and nation, who all bore 
the same name with their mistress, and were known as the Queen's 
Maries. They belonged respectively to the families of Livingston, 



THE QUEEN'S MARIES. 23 

Fleming, Seaton, and Beaton.* Whilst sojourning in this secluded 
spot, the young Queen enjoyed the company of her mother as 
her principal guardian. Lady Fleming acted as her preceptress, 
aided by John Erskine the Commendator (afterwards the Earl of 
Mar and Eegent of Scotland), together with the parson of Balma- 
clellan. It is stated in Bishop Lesly's Vernacular History of 
Scotland, that the removal of Queen Mary to Inchmahome took 
place while the English were still in Leith, where, after the battle 
of Pinkie, they remained till the 18th of September. As already 
mentioned, the removal of Mary from Inchmahome took place 
at the end of February. The Exchequer Eecord in the Eegister 
House, cited in Irving's History of Dumbartonshire, notes the 
following payment to the Queen's guardians :— " Unto the last day 
of February, in the year of God, 1547-8, which was the day of 
their departing with the Queen's grace to Dumbarton, debursed the 
sum of 200 lib." 



* After their return with the Queen from France to Scotland, one of the four 
Maries became the subject of the tragic ballad, "The Queen's Marie," first 
published entire in the " Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border," although preserved 
in detached verses in various parts of Scotland, and quoted in the correspondence 
of Robert Burns : — 

" "When she came to the Netherbow port, 
She laughed loud laughters three ; 
But when she came to the gallows foot, 
The tears blinded her e'e. 

" Yestreen the Queen had four Maries, 
The night she'll ha'e but three; 
There was Marie Seaton, and Marie Beaton, 
And Marie Carmichael, and me. 

" little did my mother ken, 

That day she cradled me, 
The lands I was to travel in, 

Or the death I was to die! " 
The Mary of this touching ballad was Mary Hamilton; she, however, was not 
one of the original four Maries who accompanied the Queen, it being probable, as 
Sir W. Scott suggests, that " if this corps continued to consist of young virgins, 
as when originally raised, it could hardly have subsisted without occasional 
recruits." On this supposition, we may account for the absence of the names of 
Mary Fleming and Mary Livingston in the ballad; and of those of Mary Hamilton 
and Mary Carmichael in the list furnished in history. " The Maries" are alluded 
to by John Knox, in terms by no means complimentary, reference being made to 
"the ballads of that age" for the "bruit" they enjoyed, in common with "the 
rest of the dancers of the Court." Their names are recorded by Keith. But in 
justice to the fair fame of the Maries, it remains to be stated, that by a strange 
poetical licence, or error of tradition, the name of Mary Hamilton has been 
connected with " a haynous murther," for which one of the Queen's chamber- 
women and the court apothecary, according to Knox, were " condemned to be 
hanged in the pnblicke street of Edinburgh." While the French waiting-maid 
figures in the ballad as Mary Hamilton, by a not less violent metamorphosis, the 
Queen's apothecary is converted into Henry Darnley. 



24 MARY'S DEPARTURE FOR FRANCE— THE PRIORY. 

In Dumbarton Castle, Queen Mary awaited the arrival of the 
galleys which wore to convey her to France. She sailed on the 
7th of August : — 

M The touching scene of the parting between the royal mother and 
daughter (says Miss Strickland,) took place on the 7th of August, in the 
presence of the Governor Arran, »ud many noble spectators, on that 
picturesque green spot of broken ground which juts from the foot of the, 
lofty rock of Dumbarton into the broad waters of the Clyde. All things 
being ready, and the tide serving, the young Sovereign was brought, 
with the ceremonial pomp of royal etiquette, by the Lords Erskine and 
Livingston, the two noble commissioners for the safe keeping of her 
person then on duty, and her other officers of state, down the narrow 
descent from her chamber in the fortress, on the western back of the 
rock, attended by her four Maries, her faithful nurse Janet Sinclair, her 
governess the Lady Fleming, her two preceptors, the Abbot of Inchma- 
home and the Parson of Balmaclellan; and her three illegitimate brothers — 
the Lord James Stewart, Prior of St. Andrews, afterwards the Regent 
Murray, Lord John, the Commendator of Holyrood Abbey, and the Lord 
Robert, Prior of Orkney — who were to be the companions of her voyage. 
The Queen Mother, assisted by the Governor Arran, delivered her royal 
daughter to the Chevalier de Villegaignon and the Sieur de Breze (or 
Brosse), hereditary Seneschal of Normandy, the gentlemen commissioned 
by the King of France to receive that precious charge. The little Queen 
was observed to shed tears silently after she had received the maternal 
blessing and farewell kiss of the only parent she had ever known; but, 
early trained in the regal science of self-control, she offered no resistance, 
and permitted herself to be carried on board the galley of the King of 
France, which had been fitted up, and sent expressly for her accommo- 
dation, by the august sire of her future spouse. An eye-witness of the 
embarkation has recorded that the young Queen was at that time one of 
the most beautiful creatures in her dominions — nay, that her equal was 
nowhere to be found, nor had the world another child of her fortune and 
hopes."— (" Queens of Scotland," vol. ii.) 

The ruins of the Priory exhibit some fine relics of the Scottish 
ecclesiastical architecture of the 13th century, with a considerable 
affinity in the detail to the English ecclesiastical style of the same 
period. Similar characteristics appear in the remains of part of the 
abbey of Cambuskenneth at Stirling, and of the cathedral of Dun- 
blane, suggesting the probability of the architect of Inchmahome 
having been employed in the completion of these more ancient 
edifices ; the church of Dunblane, as appears from the document 
authorising the building of the priory of Inchmahome, having stood 
for a century, in other words, since the building of it, without a 
roof. An intelligent archaeological friend remarks that, "In the 
delicacy of the fillets and general refinement of the mouldings, it 



PRIORY OF INCHMAHOME. 25 

(Inchmahome) reminds one much more of the transept of York 
Minster than of the choir of our own (Glasgow) Cathedral." 
According to another skilful archaeologist, who favours the writer 
with a memorandum of a visit to the ruins, there is a total absence 
of sculpture, but the mouldings seem to have received a double 
share of attention. The chancel has been without side aisles. The 
east window is composed of five graceful lancets ; the side windows 
are single and coupled lancets. On the south side are two small 
ambries and three very beautiful sedilia. The chancel arch and 
the first two bays of the nave are entirely destroyed. The nave 
has only one side aisle, the conventual buddings coming close up 
to the south side. The great western door-way is the most 
remarkable piece of architecture in the island. It is still in good 
preservation, and worthy of careful study. The buildings adjoining 
the church are very much dilapidated, with the exception of the 
refectory, which is almost uninjured. It is covered with a plain 
semicircular barrel-vault, and above this there is an apartment 
which has probably been a dormitory. The skews of the gables 
are peculiar, the moulded projections being wrought in horizontal 
curves. The Statistical Account furnishes the following additional 
particulars from the pen of the late Eev. Mr. Stirling of Port, 
whose separate work on the Priory, already referred to, contains a 
ground-plan of the building : — " Of the Priory of Inchmahome, the 
buildings are still so entire, that the uses to which each of them 
respectively was applied may be guessed at. The nave and the 
choir measure together fifty paces by twelve. The former had in 
the north wall four arches, two of which fell many years ago. One 
of the entire arches, being the western, is covered by a tower or 
belfrey; a quadrangle corresponding to which on the south side, is 
erased, as are the cloisters on the same side, and of which the 
corbels are visible. The rest of the arches had an aisle outside, of 
which the ragling is discernible on the tower. The western entrance 
is entire, and some of the hewn stones of a window above are visible. 
The oriel window of the choir is filled up with rubble work of 
modern date. The side walls of this part of the building are 
almost entire. South of the church, at the distance of a few yards, 
are the ruins of an edifice, consisting, on the ground floor, of the 
refectory, nineteen paces by eleven, and to which was an entrance 
from the dormitory on the north, another from the kitchen on the 
south-east angle, and a third about the centre of the east wall, and 
descending by a few steps from the stairs leading to two or more 
apartments above the kitchen." It appears that the materials of 



26 MEMORIAL SCULPTURES. 

this part of the building have contributed greatly to the construc- 
tion of the more modern of the Talla edifices, as well as of a 
mausoleum in Inchmahome, which, in defiance of all taste or 
design, runs obliquely between the church and the dormitory, 
covering a part of the foundations of both buildings. This 
unsightly excrescence upon the ecclesiastical remains appears to 
have boon hastily got up for the reception of the body of Lord 
Kilpont, who was slaughtered by James Stewart of Ardvorlich 
in Montrose's camp at Collace, in 1614, the corpse having been 
despatched by Montrose to the deceased's father, William, eighth 
Earl of Menteith (of the Grahams), then a state prisoner in Talla. 
"William the ninth and last Earl of the Graham family, was son of 
Lord Kilpont, and by his will he appointed the walls and gateway 
which occupy part of the site of the church to be built, to protect 
his father's tomb. The monastic ruins of the Isle of Eest have 
been for ages the burial place of several noble and ancient families. 
The most conspicuous of the memorial sculptures within the walls 
of the church is a recumbent monument near the centre of the 
choir, with the figures in relief, seven feet in length, hewn out of 
a single block of stone, and representing Walter Stewart, Earl of 
Menteith, and his Countess, in whose right he enjoyed the earldom. 
Their second son was the governor of Dumbarton Castle, and the 
betrayer of the patriot Wallace to Edward I. The Earl, who was 
a crusader in the middle of the thirteenth century, and distinguished 
himself at the battle of Largs in resisting the Norwegian invasion, 
appears clad in armour, and "the fess cheque of three tracts" 
sculptured upon the shield shows him to have been a Stewart. 
His vow of going to the Holy Land is symbolised, in accordance 
with the practice of the time, in the cross-legged attitude. Both 
figures are represented as treading on lions, also a common device 
in ancient monuments, secular and sacerdotal, and supposed to have 
been in allusion to the passage in the 91st psalm, "Thou shalt 
tread upon the lion," &amp;c. The arm of the lady lovingly encircles 
the neck of the knight, whose left hand rests on the lady's side; 
but the effigies of both have been grievously mutilated. The 
sculpture, though rude, is by no means inexpressive, and the atti- 
tude of mutual affection in which the couple are represented 
imparts a tender interest to this memorial of the stern old times. 
The figures are delineated with spirit in one of the engravings in 
the curious work of Mr. Macgregor Stirling, who also celebrates the 
monument in his verses on "Inschemachame" : — 



THE OLD TREES OE INCHMAHOME. 27 

" The steel-clad Stewart, Red-cross Knight, 
Menteith, his Countess fair and bright, 

Here live in sculptured stone. 
I boast not feat of Holy Land; 
He bravely fought on Fairlie's strand. 



Blest pair! in death ye live, 

Ye love beyond the tomb ; 
Your mutual hearts to God yo give, 

He gives you welcome home." 

The island of Inclimaliome was in former times divided into two 
nearly equal parts, one on the east, embracing the Priory and its 
grounds; the other, on the west, forming the gardens of the Men- 
teiths. The ancient boundaries are still traceable by a common 
pathway extending from north to south, having a rude stone wall on 
either side. An eminence bordering the loch in the Menteith's 
division is known as the Nun's Hill, although there is no reason to 
believe that female recluses ever had a footing on the island. The 
primitive and tranquil aspect of the place is enhanced by the noble 
old trees covering its surface, and embosoming the architectural 
remains in their umbrageous foliage. The Spanish chestnut has 
here thriven for ages, and scions from the ancient stock of Inchma- 
home are found ornamenting many of the parks and lawns of the 
Lennox, although nowhere in this region, so far as is known, has this 
fine tree reached the stalwart dimensions of several of the specimens 
nourishing here in their green old age. One chestnut measures 
19 feet in circumference near the ground, and several others are 
14 feet and upwards in circumference. A few gigantic individuals 
have succumbed to time, and lie stretched on the ground. All the 
other species of trees on the island exhibit marks of great age.* 
The oak, birch, plane, pine, walnut, eldor, mountain-ash, and haw- 
thorn, are characterised more or less by their venerable appearance, 
and several of them far exceed in bulk their congeners of the low- 
land forest. The secluded spot is also not a little beholden to 
the varied beauties of a humbler but not less luxuriant vegetation. 
The shores of both islands are encircled by the floating leaves and 
flowers of the white and yellow water-lilies ; and the Tijpha latifolia 

* The bulkier Spanish chestnuts are nearly four hundred years of age. 
Mr. Macgregor Stirling, writing in 1815, states that about a dozen of the largest 
specimens were then said to be above three centuries old, " a circumstance which 
(as the writer recollects to havelono; ago heard) was ascertained at the last thinning 
of the timber, at least forty years since (*'. e. 1775) by counting the rings." They 
are, he adds, " getting what the foresters call stag-headed, and rear their daring 
antlers to the skies in a thousand fantastic and picturesque forms." 



28 WILD FLOWERS— QUEEN MARY'S BOWER. 

(reed-mace), the most magnificent of onr Scottish aquatic flowering 
plants, was noted by the late Dr. Graham of Aberfoyle, as frequenting 
the shore of Talla. The commoner ferns occur profusely amongst 
the ruins. The celandine (Chelidonium majus) has long established 
itself in the crevices of the walls, which it adorns with its yellow 
flowers. Early in the season, the wake-robin (Arum maculatum) 
grows abundantly amongst the ruins; at a later period, the purple 
loose-strife (Ly thrum Salicaria) appears plentifully on the borders 
of the island. It is remarkable that the elegant little plant, Lobelia 
Dortmanna, universally diffused amongst the Highland lochs, and in 
mid-summer adorning with its light-blue nodding flowers the shores 
of Loch Ard, Loch Katrine, Loch Achray, and Loch Yennachar, 
finds no place (according to Dr. Graham) in the Lake of Menteith, 
although common to freshwater lakes in almost every part of Scot- 
land. The woodland charms of Inchmahome culminate in the month 
of September, when the foliage of its stately trees becomes radiant 
with the blending tints of autumn. It is then also that the mountain 
ash, with its crimson clusters of rowans, and the barberry, springing 
up in the copsewood, or mounting high amongst the broken arches, 
and putting forth its pendulous racemes of red berries, — together 
exhibit, in their leaves and fruit, the perfection of harmonious 
colouring, and unite in lending an added beauty to this exquisite scene 
of sylvan loveliness and repose. Such incidents of the season will not 
be deemed trivial by the visitor who remembers that it was precisely 
at this period of the year that the youthful Queen Mary took up her 
temporary abode in the Isle of Eest. She left it before wood and 
garden resumed their vernal freshness ; and the cherished memories 
of that calm retreat of her innocent childhood must often have risen 
like a sweet vision to her mind, in far different scenes and circum- 
stances, associated with the autumnal grace of the island trees, 
the gentle lake reflecting on its placid surface solemn pile and 
embosoming wood, the yellow corn-fields on its winding shores, the 
encircling forests and grey hills — as we see them now bathed in the 
mellow sunshine of a day in September. The ecclesiastical structure 
on the island was no doubt soon allowed to fall into decay. The 
Priory of Inchmahome and its pertinents were granted in 1606 as a 
temporal lordship, to John Earl of Mar. In all other respects the 
island has been allowed to remain for three hundred years in its state 
of primitive simplicity. More especially there has been preserved 
with scrupulous care a little plot of ground on a gentle eminence 
near the margin of the lake, which is traditionally known by the 
name of Queen Mary's Bower. It is of an oblong square or oval 



QUEEN MARY'S BOWER— CASTLE OF TALLA. 29 

form, about eighteen feet in length by twelve in breadth, and consists 
of the remains of a box-wood border, with a hawthorn tree in the 
centre, all of great age. The box plants have grown to be trees of 
nearly fifteen feet in height and eight or nine inches in diameter, 
exceeding, if we remember correctly, the average size of the old 
wood at Boxhill in Surrey, one of the few places in this country 
where the Buxus sempervirens grows wild. As the name of bower 
is obviously misapplied to this little plot, it has been suggested that 
the inclosure may have been the " child-garden " where the young 
Queen and her four Maries amused their leisure with the cultivation 
of flowers. This suggestion proceeds upon the supposition, however, 
that Mary's residence at Inchmahome extended over two years. 
It has already been stated, on the contrary, that she came to the 
island in September and left it at the end of the ensuing February. 
The intervening period being the least favourable season of the year 
for gardening, it may be presumed that Mary merely took possession, 
before the winter set in, of a previously formed flower-plot, which 
would naturally be remembered afterwards as having been an object 
of interest to the youthful sovereign and her four playmates, the 
Queen's Maries. Mr. Macgregor Stirling introduces the " boxwood 
summer-house " in his verses on the Priory, in connection with the 
sports of the Queen's court : — 

u My orchard's wealth, my boxwood's graco 
(Enlivening yet the sylvan place, 
Embellishing my isle of rest) 
Furnished the jocund rural fete, 
To soothe the youthful sceptered guest, 
Each wayward thought obliterate, 
And banish all alarms." 

The neighbouring islet of Talla contains the ruins of a fortalice 
of the Earls of Menteith. The buildings seem to have been of a 
rude style of architecture, possessing no interest to the archaeological 
visitor, but rendered picturesque by the profuse vegetation in which 
they are enveloped. The old church of Inchmahome afforded the 
materials for constructing part of the building. Stirling prints in 
" Notes on the Priory " a curious inventory of the clothing and 
furnishings of the house of Talla in 1692-94. Prominence is given 
to the substantial comforts belonging to "the brew-house chamber," 
otherwise described as " the chamber above the brew-house," which 
was on the east side of the island, and was " hunge with green" and 
furnished with two beds, one of " green stuffe with rods and pands 
conforme," the other of "red scarlet cloath." The brew-house 



30 DONALD OF THE HAMMER. 

chamber was moreover decorated with a red table-cloth and " a red 
scarlet resting chair." It thus appears that the brew-house of the 
family of Menteith possessed peculiar attractions. Not only was 
there above it the gorgeous apartment now described, but there was 
attached to its glowing walls, apparently for the purpose of utilising 
the radiant heat, a pair of "to-falls" set out with three beds, one 
" brown" and the others " red." To the westward of Talla, about 
a furlong's distance, is the Dog-isle, not many yards in circumference, 
and said to have been used as a dog-kennel by the Earls of Menteith. 
According to local tradition, it was about the time when Mary 
found a refuge in the Priory from the "rough wooing" of the 
Protector Somerset, that a conflict took place near the lake between 
the Stewarts of Appin and the Grahams of Menteith, which is 
known in Scottish history as the legend of Donald of the Hammer. 
The incident, however, is referred to a later date by Sir Walter 
Scott, in the "Tales of a Grandfather." The island of Talla, it 
appears, was of too limited an area to afford a site for any other 
buildings than the castle whose ruins now cover its surface, or if 
any space remained after providing for the convenience and security 
of the feudal keep, it seems to have been reserved for the " brew- 
house" commemorated above. The stables, cow-houses, poultry 
yard, and other appurtenances of the castle were therefore built 
upon the neighbouring margin of the lake. Now it happened that 
there was an assembly of the Grahams at Talla house, on the 
occasion of a marriage. Preparations for the festival were made 
to some extent in the separate part of the establishment on the 
mainland, and the legend bears that amongst the ample supplies 
provided for the feast, there was a large quantity of poultry. The 
culinary operations were in progress when a party of the Stewarts 
passed that way, returning to the Highlands, according to the local 
tradition, after the defeat at Pinky. The leader of the Stewarts 
was Invernahyle, the chief of the second branch of the Appin 
family, and who, when an infant, became, on the assassination of 
his father, the foster-child of a smith, under whose care he grew 
up, and acquired great personal strength, insomuch as to be able to 
wield two fore-hammers on the anvil at once, whence he gained 
the name of Donuil nan Ord, or Donald of the Hammer. Donald 
and his followers, on reaching the margin of the lake, found much 
good victuals ready, and " being possessed (says Sir Walter) of an 
excellent appetite, the western Highlanders neither asked questions 
nor waited for an invitation, but devoured all the provisions that 
had been prepared for the Grahams, and then went on their way 



LOCH RUSKIE-LOCH VENNACHAR. 31 

rejoicing, through the difficult and dangerous path which leads 
from the banks of the Loch of Menteith, through the mountains to 
the side of Loch Katrine." Indignant at the loss of their dinner, 
and at the insult offered to their family, the Grahams, with the 
Earl at their head, instantly took boat, and landing on the northern 
side of the lake, started in pursuit of the marauders, and came up 
with them in the gorge of a pass near a rock called Craig-Vad, 
or the Wolf's Cliff. In the Statistical Account of the parish of 
Port, the scene of the collision is said to be Tobernareal, "a 
remarkable spring of water on the top of the ridge, as the traveller 
goes from Menteith to Strathgartry, and comes in sight of Benledi 
and Loch Vennachar." The Earl fell by the powerful arm of 
Donald of the Hammer, and nearly all the Lowlanders were slain. 
Donald, favoured by the darkness of the night, made his escape with 
a single attendant. From the cause of the quarrel, the Grahams 
obtained the nickname of Gramoch an Gorrigh, or "Grahams of 
the Hens," although, remarks Sir W. Scott, " they certainly lost 
no honour in the encounter, having fought like game-cocks." 

Near the road betwixt Port and Callander there is a bleak little 
lake named Loch Euskie. It contains an islet, with some vestiges 
of a fortress assigned traditionally to Sir John Menteith of Euskie, 
the betrayer of Wallace. Some writers, Lord Hailes amongst the 
number, have attempted to vindicate this ignoble Menteith from the 
accusation of treachery, on the ground that he arrested Wallace in 
the discharge of his military duty, being at the time Governor of 
Dumbarton Castle. He it was, at any rate, who delivered the 
patriot over to Edward I., who showed his appreciation of the 
importance of the service by appointing Menteith to be Sheriff of 
Dumbartonshire. 



LOCH VEMA.CHAE. 

On leaving Callander, we follow the road turning to the left at 
the small hamlet of Kilmahog. The stream issuing from Loch 
Vennachar here sweeps through a flat moorland named Bochastle, 
where an eminence named the Dun, together with several other 
mounds on the plain, have been conjectured to be of Eoman origin, 
although said to bear rather a striking resemblance to deposits of a 
lacustrine or a glacial description in other parts of the country. 
A short drive brings us to the lower extremity of the lake, where 
it contracts into the river, at Coilantogle Ford, referred to in the 
poem which has rendered classic every inch of the ground we are

now to traverse. This was the limit to the safe-conduct pledged 
to Fitz- James by Eoderick Dhu; and here, having discharged 
himself of the sacred obligation due to a guest, the Celtic Chief 
challenged the Sassenach knight to mortal combat* Loch 
Yennachar, Loch Drunkie, and Loch Katrine together afford to 
Glasgow an inexhaustible supply of pure water. Loch Vennachar 
being the principal feeder of the Teith, the Glasgow Water Com- 
missioners came under an obligation to regulate the discharge into 
that river, which is accordingly provided for by the compensation 
works at the outlet of the lake. Loch Vennachar is about four 
miles in length, with an area of 900 acres. The appearance of the 
lower part of the lake, along the northern side of which the road 
winds, is tame and uninviting, compared to that of the upper 
extremity, where it borrows some of the beauties belonging pro- 
perly to the scenery of Loch Achray. A pleasing view of the lake 
is obtained from the heathery upland about half a mile before 
reaching the Trosachs New Hotel, where a fine effect is produced by 
the rugged declivities of the hills clad with copsewood, which 
descends to join with the broad patch of green meadow margining 
the expanse of placid water. The upper end of the lake receives 
the superfluous waters of Loch Achray, flowing in a serpentine 
course through a green strath, diversified with hummocky knolls 
and primitive cottages, which may be held as representing the 
"Duncraggan huts" of the poem, "half hidden in the copse so 
green." The verdant strath is " Lanrick Mead," the gathering-place 
of the Clan Alpine. 

* " The Chief in silence strode before, 

And reached that torrent's sounding shore, 

Which, daughter of three mighty lakes, 

From Vennachar in silver breaks, 

Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines 

On Bochastle the mouldering lines, 

Where Rome, the empress of the world, 

Of yore her eagle wings unfurled. 

" And here his course the Chieftain staid, 
Threw down his target and his plaid, 
And to the Lowland warrior said: — 
Bold Saxon! to his promise just 
Vich-Alpine has discharged his trust. 



Now, man to man, and steel to steel, 
A Chieftain's vengeance thou shalt feel. 
See, here, all vantageless I stand, 
Armed, like thyself, with single brand; 
For this is Coilantogle ford, 
And thou must keep thee with thy sword." 

Lady of the Lake, Canto 5. 



GLENFINLAS- BRIG OF TURK-LOCH ACHRAY. 33 

Glenfinlas opens upon the plateau where the Trosachs New 
Hotel is situated. This glen formed part of an ancient royal forest, 
and the country, as well as that of the neighbouring district of 
Balquhidder, was formerly inhahited by the Macgregors. Scott's 
ballad of "Glenfinlas, or Lord Eonald's coronach," the author's 
first avowed attempt in verse, is founded upon a tradition of the 
glen; and the scenery which it depicts is reproduced in the " Lady 
of the Lake," "Waverley," and "Bob Roy." A short walk up 
the glen conducts to a wildly beautiful spot, where a torrent pours 
through a deep channel of slaty rock, overhung by pendulous 
birches. The upper part of the glen, after we pass a round wooded 
hill, emerges upon open cultivated land and pastoral vales. The 
birch-tree everywhere contributes to beautify the courses of the 
streams in this romantic territory, by its graceful trunk, shining 
bark, and pensile branches. In Glenfinlas, however, it is made 
subservient to use as well as ornament. Near the entrance to the 
glen there is an extensive work where the birch is converted into 
bobbins for winding thread, and the path is plentifully strewed 
with fragments of the wood out of which " pirns" have been deftly 
scooped. The manufacturing element has in fact invaded the 
region of romance ; and the sentimental traveller has all his ideas 
of poetical propriety outraged, by meeting, in the wilds of the 
Macgregor's country, with the symbols and adjuncts of the " looms, 
beams, traddles, and shuttles" of Glasgow, so heartily denounced 
by Eob Roy, when his kinsman the Bailie considerately proposed 
to make weavers of his two hopeful sons. 

The Brig of Turk crosses the stream which issues from Glen- 
finlas, and the tourist will pause on its old-fashioned arch to gaze 
on the scene of exquisite beauty now opening in every direction. 
The bridge is only renowned from being mentioned in the poem 
which has invested the whole of this romantic land with a fresh 
charm; and it is perhaps the highest tribute to the genius of Scott, 
that in every scene which his imagination has consecrated, the 
traveller involuntarily finds his interest divided between the beauties 
of nature and the incidents of a fictitious tale. 



LOCH ACHRAY. 

In order to obtain a comprehensive view of the upper and finer 
part of Loch Vennachar, along with the lower extremity of Loch 
Achray, one has only to climb the heights opposite the new inn, or 
scramble through hazels and dwarf oaks up the hillsides in the 



34: LOCH ACHRAY-TIIE TROSACHS AND LOCH KATRINE. 

neighbourhood. But Loch Achray first bursts on the sight in all 
its loveliness, at a bend of the road where the lake begins to 
expand, bringing full in view its bright waters reposing silently 
and without a ripple under the shadow of the overhanging woods 
and rocks, with the picturesque heights of Ben-an closing in the 
scene ; while, by crossing the river, and shifting the point of view 
the noble summit of Ben Venue is revealed in the background, with 
its ridge sweeping down in a graceful curve, and separating Loch 
Katrine from Achray. The intense serenity of the picture is finely 
touched by Scott : — 

11 The rocks, the bosky thickets, sleep 
So stilly on thy bosom deep, 
The lark's blithe carol, from the cloud, 
Seems for the scene too gaily loud." 

In his "Letters on the Highlands" to Sir Walter Scott, Dr. John 
Macculloch describes the composition of the picture with his 
characteristic discrimination : — 

" It is a frequent fault (he says) in Loch Cateran (which he insists is 
the true spelling and etymology of the name), that its landscapes, like 
those of lakes in general, consist for the most part, of a distance and a 
foreground only; the vacant water occupying the place of the middle 
ground, and thus producing a meagreness of composition, of which every 
one must be sensible. At Loch Achray, there is water enough to stamp 
the character of the landscape, and to give life and brilliancy to the 
surrounding objects, without enfeebling the picture, either by its position 
or its extent. Whether occupying a portion of the middle ground, or of 
the foreground, or of both, it only performs that accessary part which 
water should ever do ; contrasting, by its vacancy, its tranquillity, and its 
breadth of colour, with the splendour and bustle and multiplicity of the 
rocks, the woods, and the trees; and thus, while it adds variety and 
life to the landscape, conferring on it that repose so essential to good 
composition." 



THE TEOSACHS AKD LOCH KATRINE. 

A wooded road skirting the margin of Loch Achray brings us to 
the opening of the Trosachs, a name which Gaelic etymologists 
derive from Troschen, meaning the rough or bristled territory. 
The Trosachs Inn is three quarters of a mile from Loch Katrine, 
and the last mile-stone marks half a mile from the Loch and nine 
miles from Callander, of which parish the lake and the Trosachs 
form part. A quoad sacra church, with a charming little mans©

(parsonage), occupy secluded nooks on Loch Achray. The hotel, 
built in the castellated style, and embosomed amongst trees, has 
replaced the wayside auberge which, under the euphonious name of 
Ardcheanochrochan or Ardcrockran inn, was accustomed to receive 
the tourists who flocked to this romantic region in the earlier years 
of its fame. The old name is still retained in the district, and it 
has been somewhere slyly suggested that the spacious hotel would 
be less crowded in the heat of the season, were the pronunciation 
of its name by English vocal organs exacted as the shibboleth of 
admission to its hospitality. From this point to Loch Katrine the 
glen receives the name of the Trosachs. It is flanked on the right 
by the lofty summit of Ben-an; and Ben Yenue (2388 feet) rears 
its stately crest on the left. There are glens in Scotland surrounded 
by loftier hills, and presenting on an incomparably greater scale the 
characters of breadth, and depth, and wild magnificence, such as 
are to be witnessed in the upper denies of Glen Nevis, amongst the 
gloomy recesses of Glenco, and where Goatfell descends into the 
profound solitudes of Glen Sannox; but the valley of the Trosachs 
possesses excellencies peculiarly its own, uniting grandeur and 
strength with a splendour and an affluence of ornament unparal- 
leled in the scenery of Scotland. Every turn of the road unfolds 
fresh views of wild and romantic beauty, on which the eye reposes 
with new delight. The valley is one continued maze of rugged 
mountains, grey rocks, and green woods, lofty precipices and dark 
ravines, shivering cliffs and heathery knolls, with masses of trees 
dispersed in picturesque confusion, and, conspicuous amongst the 
sylvan beauties of the landscape, the light and graceful Highland 
birch, which, singly or in tufts, clambers up the tall precipices, 
and adapts itself, as no other tree has the power of doing, to the 
varying features of the fairy-like scene. Amidst all this amplitude 
and diversity of form, the eye is surprised by the ever-shifting 
effects of light and shade, producing all the day long a succession 
of novel and striking pictures. The scene is described by Scott 
with equal truthfulness and vivacity, and although the passage is 
of the longest, and sufficiently familiar to the readers of the " Lady 
of the Lake," its omission here would be unpardonable : — 

" The western waves of ebbing day 
Rolled o'er the glen their level way; 
Each purple peak, each flinty spire, 
Was bathed in floods of living fire. 
But not a setting beam could glow 
Within the dark ravines below. 



3G THE TROSACHS. 

Where twined the path in shadow hid, 

Round many a rocky pyramid, 

Shooting abruptly from the dell 

Its thunder-splintered pinnacle ; 

Bound many an insulated mass, 

The native bulwarks of the pass, 

Huge as the tower which builders vain 

Presumptuous piled on Shinar's plain. 

The rocky summits, split and rent, 

Formed turret, dome, or battlement, 

Or seemed fantastically set 

With cupola or minaret, 

Wild crests as pagod ever decked, 

Or mosque of Eastern architect. 

Nor were these earth-born castles bare, 

Nor lacked they many a banner fair ; 

For from their shivered brows displayed, 

Far o'er the unfathomable glade, 

All twinkling with the dew-drops sheen, 

The brier-rose fell in streamers green, 

And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes, 

Waved in the west-wind's summer sighs. 



Boon nature scattered, free and wild, 
Each plant or flower, the mountain's child, 
Here eglantine embalmed the air, 
Hawthorn and hazel mingled there; 
The primrose pale, and violet flower, 
Found in each cliff a narrow bower; 
Foxglove and nightshade, side by side, 
Emblems of punishment and pride, 
Grouped their dark hues with every stain 
The weather-beaten crags retain. 
With boughs that quaked at every breath, 
Grey birch and aspen wept beneath; 
Aloft, the ash and warrior oak 
Cast anchor in the rifted rock; 
And higher yet the pine-tree hung 
His shattered trunk, and frequent flung, 
Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high, 
His bows athwart the narrowed sky. 
Highest of all, where white peaks glanced, 
Where glistening streamers waved and danced, 
The wanderer's eye could barely view 
The summer heaven's delicious blue, 
So wondrous wild, the whole might seem 
The scenery of a fairy dream." 



LOCH KATRINE. 37 

The succeeding verses describe tlie scene on emerging from the 
glen and corning in sight of the lake : — 

" Onward, amid the copse 'gan peep 
A narrow inlet, still and deep, 
Affording scarce such breadth of brim, 
As served the wild duck's brood to swim. 
Lost for a space through thickets veering, 
But broader when again appearing, 
Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face 
Could on the dark blue mirror trace; 
And farther as the hunter strayed, 
Still broader sweep its channels made, 
The shaggy mounds no longer stood, 
Emerging from entangled wood, 
But, wave- encircled, seemed to float 
Like castle girdled with its moat; 
Yet broader floods expanding still 
Divide them from their parent hill, 
Till eaGh, retiring, claims to be 
An islet in an inland sea." 

Loch Katrine (which derives its name from cateran, a reiver 
or robber, indicating that it was in the times of the creagh and the 
foray, the resort of cattle-lifters and banditti,) is eight or nine miles 
in length, averaging two miles in breadth, and having a surface of 
3000 acres. The lake presents a somewhat tortuous outline. From 
its eastern extremity flows a stream, which, expanding in its pro- 
gress first into Loch Achray and afterwards into Loch Vennachar, 
receives the Lubnaig, and becomes the river Teith at Callander, 
whence it descends to the Forth, of which it is the principal 
tributary. The rocks of this territory, including Ben Venue and 
Ben-an, consist of mica schist, to which, as has already been 
remarked, the mountain and lake scenery in Perthshire owes its 
characteristic features. In the woods overlooking the lake, the fern- 
gatherer will find Hymenophyllum Wilsoni and H. Tunbridgense, 
the former occurring plentifully amongst the rocks at the little pier 
where the steam-boat passengers land and embark. The woods are 
fragrant with Lastrea Oreopteris, the mountain fern ; and the copses 
abound with birch, oak, alder, ash, mountain ash, hawthorn, hazel, 
aspen, and pine. The picturesque scenery, continuous with that of 
the Trosachs, is confined to a mile or two on either side of the loch 
at its eastern extremity; beyond that, Loch Katrine degenerates 
into one of the dullest of lakes. At Glengyle, the western end, 
the shore again becomes rocky and precipitous, and the lake recovers 



38 LOCH KATRINE-BEN VENUE. 

somewhat of its bold character ; but the great charm of Loch Katrine 
lies on the cast, in the luxuriantly wooded islands, and the rocky 
and sylvan scenery spread out at the base of Ben Venue. When- 
ever we leave the little fairy-land at that end of the loch, and 
proceed towards the west, we feel that the enchantment is gone. 

Sir Walter, in one of his most graphic passages, depicts the scene 
which bursts upon the view where the valley of the Trosachs opens 
upon the lake : — 

" And thus an airy point he won, 
Where, gleaming with the setting sun, 
One burnished sheet of living gold, 
Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled, 
In all her length far winding lay, 
With promontory, creek, and bay, 
And islands that, empurpled bright, 
Floated amid the livelier light, 
And mountains that like giants stand, 
To sentinel enchanted land. 
High on the south, huge Ben Venue 
Down on the lake in masses threw 
Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurled, 
The fragments of an earlier world; 
A wildering forest feathered o'er 
His ruined sides and summits hoar, 
While on the north, through middle air, 
Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare." 

A comprehensive view of the more striking scenes on the lake is 
obtained by proceeding along the road on the north side to a pro- 
montory commanding the wide expanse of water and land. The 
road thither also affords an opportunity of observing how the 
declivity of the hill is scarred by ravines, while enormous masses 
of the rock have been detached from the mountain and rolled down 
to the margin of the lake. Dr. Macculloch deprecates limiting the 
walk to this side of the lake, and also the making exclusive use of 
a boat, recommending the traveller to explore the bays and head- 
lands on the opposite or south side for a succession of brilliant 
views. He praises the declivity of Ben Venue as having no rival 
anywhere. The fitful play of the light is constantly revealing some 
hidden form, some hill or wood or precipice hitherto unobserved, 
and producing an ever-moving and changing scene, " as if the hand 
of magic were hourly operating a new creation." The same accurate 
and analytical observer gives the following hints for viewing the 
lake : —

LOCH KATRINE— GOBLIN CAVE. 39 

" To attempt to detail the various pictures on this northern side of the 
water (as seen from the south), would be to undertake a task alike laborious 
and ineffectual. Only let me remark, for the sake of those to whom this 
lake is new, that neither the value nor the number of the scenes contained 
within this short space of two miles will easily be discovered on a first 
visit, nor without certain precautions which experience alone will teach. 
It is natural to fix the eye on the great features, to have the attention 
engaged by the whole picture rather than by the parts; nor is it easy, 
without considerable effort, to withdraw the mind from the general and 
overwhelming effect of the entire scene. Thus we overlook the rapid and 
incessant changes that occur near us, and see but one or a few pictures 
where there exist hundreds. Let the spectator bestow his chief attention 
on the objects immediately near him, on the wonderful variety of rocks 
and trees, of bays, precipices, promontories, and sinuosities along which 
the road is conducted, and from these form his pictures. The distance is 
always nearly the same, and he may safely neglect it; as there is no 
danger that it will not command his attention whenever that is required. 
Thus he will add both to his pleasures and to his stores; and will discover 
also, if he was not before aware of it, that, even in a single landscape in 
nature, it is impossible to pay due attention to all the parts, without a 
considerable effort, and without a degree of study which may be called 
analytical." , 

Another excursion practicable only to the sojourner of a day or 
two, is suggested by the same writer, who advises all who are really 
desirous of knowing this lake to bestow one forenoon on the wilds 
of Ben Venue itself. The scenery of Bealach-nam-Bo, (meaning 
" the pass of cattle,") formed among the grey precipices and dark 
recesses, the knotted oaks and pendent birches, is unexampled for 
wildness and beauty ; while the same spot also affords general views 
of the Trosachs and of the lake, entirely distinct in character from 
all the former, " more wild, more strange, and more romantic — an 
incredible chaos of objects, but a chaos of beauty and sublimity." 
The Goblin Cave, Coir-nan-Uriskin, is a vast circular hollow in the 
mountain of Ben Venue, overhanging the south-eastern extremity 
of the loch. "It is surrounded (says Sir Walter Scott) with 
stupendous rocks, and overshadowed with birch-trees, mingled with 
oaks, the spontaneous production of the mountain, even where its 
cliffs appear denuded of soil." The name signifies the corrie of the 
wild or shaggy men; these, according to Dr. Graham, a writer on 
Perthshire scenery and traditions, were the Brownies of the High- 
lands, who, like their congeners in the low country, could be gained 
over by kind attentions, to perform the drudgery of the farm and 
other friendly offices. Although dispersed over the Highlands, the 
cave of Ben Venue was the meeting-place of their order : — 



40 THE ISLAND— A LEGEND. 

11 By many a bard, in Celtic tongue, 
Has Coir-nan-Uriskin been sung; 
A softer name the Saxons gave, 
And called the grot the Goblin Cave. 
It was a wild and strange retreat, 
As e'er was trod by outlaw's feet. 
The dell upon the mountain's crest, 
Yawned like a gash on warrior's breast; 
Its trench had staid full many a rock, 
Hurled by primeval earthquake shock 
From Ben Venue's grey summit wild, 
And here in random ruin piled, 
They frowned incumbent o'er the spot 
And formed the rugged sylvan grot." 

Much, of the wood of Ben Venue has been cut down of late years, 
and the Cave of the Goblins, although still an attractive resort, has 
been shorn of its oaks and birches, whose mingled shade was wont 
to make twilight at noontide. The black eagle has, lately also, been 
driven from its ancient eyry in the surrounding precipices. 

Near the eastern extremity of the loch, a terminal portion of one 
of the headlands, detached from the adjacent shore, will be recognised 
as " The Island " of the poem, 

" Where Ellen's hand had taught to twine 
The ivy and Idsean vine, 
The clematis, the favoured flower 
Which boasts the name of virgin bower, 
And every hardy plant could bear 
Loch Katrine's keen and searching air." 

The following tradition relates to one of the islets of the loch. 
Some of Cromwell's soldiers having penetrated the defiles of the 
Trosachs for the purpose of plundering the natives, several of the 
latter tracked their course and shot one of the party dead, whose 
grave is said still to mark the scene of blood, and gives to the place 
the name of Bealach-an-Duine, " the pass or defile of the men." 
The soldiers resolved to avenge the death of their comrade by 
plundering the island, to which the people of the neighbouring 
country were wont to betake themselves, with their most valuable 
possessions, on the approach of an enemy. One of the party 
accordingly swam to the island to fetch a boat to his comrades, who 
remained on shore watching his progress; when just as the soldier 
had reached the nearest point of the island, one of the women 
severed his head from his body. The hostile party, on witnessing 
the fate of their companion, speedily retreated from their perilous 



BAILIE NICOL JARVIE'S PROJECT. 41 

situation. The poet is supposed to have had in his eye the defile 
of Bealach-an-Duine in describing the death of Fitz-James's 
" gallant grey." The guides, of course, point out the exact spot 
where 

"... The good steed, his labours o'er, 
Stretched his stiff limbs, to rise no more." 

The scenery of the Trosachs and Loch Katrine was first brought 
under the notice of the public by Dr. Eobertson, the minister of 
Callander, in the " Statistical Account," in 1791, but it was reserved 
for Sir Walter Scott to achieve for it the celebrity which it has 
enjoyed since the publication of the Lady of the Lake in 1810. Till 
that period the place was nearly inaccessible ; and even when the 
poem appeared, there was no road through the Trosachs to the loch. 
The characteristic features of Loch Achray and Loch Katrine have 
been repeatedly delineated by Horatio Macculloch, whose pictures 
of Highland scenery have no equal in poetical feeling and the careful 
study of nature. 

The departing- steamer leisurely winds its way amongst the 
islets to afford its passengers a lingering look at the rugged grey 
precipices of Ben Venue and the sunny glades of the Trosachs. 
In a few minutes more the vessel turns her prow towards the 
west, and we leave behind the enchanted land, enshrined like a 
rTrecious gem in its alpine casket. The transition is somewhat 
abrupt from wild and wooded cliffs to tame and unadorned shores ; 
but the change prepares us for passing at the same time from 
the beautiful to the useful. The age is utilitarian, and even the 
romance of Loch Katrine has succumbed to the prevailing spirit. 
When Bailie Mcol Jarvie sailed down Loch Lomond on his return 
to the Saut Market, in company with Francis Osbaldistone, after 
their eventful visit to the country of the Macgregors, the worthy 
magistrate engaged the reluctant attention of his English fellow- 
traveller by a grave speculation on the possibility of converting the 
area of the lake to useful purposes. He calculated to a nicety how 
the lake could be drained, "giving to plough and harrow many 
hundred, ay, many a thousand acres, from whilk no man could get 
earthly gude e'enow, unless it were a gedd (pike), or a dish o' perch 
now and then." It was part of the Bailie's plan, however, to reserve 
as much of the loch as would suffice for the purposes of water- 
carriage, and enable coal-barges and gabbards to sail up the Leven 
from Dumbarton to Glenfalloch. Had he speculated, in like manner, 
on the practicability of directing the superfluous waters of Loch 
Katrine from their teeming fountains into an aqueduct tunnelled 



42 GLASGOW WATER WORKS. 

through rocky hills and carried over ravines for six-and-twenty 
miles, — there to he discharged into a reservoir capahle of containing 
500,000,000 gallons, — whence a pure and perennial stream should 
flow into the city of Glasgow, through eight miles more of pipes, at 
the rate of 20 or 30 millions of gallons every day, and, arriving there, 
be poured through more than fifty miles of pipes into every street 
and alley and dwelling, from the Saut Market to St. Mungo's, and 
from Camlachie to Clayslaps, and all at an engineering cost of 
£630,000, — the project would have been considered scarcely more 
feasible, and in the hands of the Author of "Waverley the pleasantry 
would have proved not less diverting, than the worthy Bailie's 
notable plan for draining Loch Lomond And yet these sentences 
briefly describe an accomplished fact. Glasgow enjoys an almost 
unlimited water-supply from Loch Katrine ; and Loch Katrine grants 
the beneficent boon without abating one jot of her beauty or her 
strength. 

The sluice of the great aqueduct was opened with due ceremony 
by the Queen. Her Majesty and the late Prince Albert visited 
Loch Katrine for this purpose on the 14th of October, 1859. Her 
Majesty had accepted in the most gracious manner the invitation 
of the Glasgow Water Commissioners to inaugurate the intro- 
duction to the city of the water of Loch Katrine. The Queen 
left Edinburgh in the morning, and proceeded by railway to 
Callander, and thence by carriage to the Trosachs, whence she 
embarked in the Eob Eoy steam-boat on Loch Katrine, and 
proceeded to the mouth of the tunnel by which the waters are 
introduced to the aqueduct, near the western extremity of the lake. 
Her Majesty was accompanied by the Prince Consort, the Princess 
Alice, the Princess Helena, Lady Churchill, the Honourable Miss 
Cathcart, the Duke of Newcastle, the Honourable General Grey, 
the Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Ponsonby. The reception 
of the royal party at Callander and along the route was all that 
Highland loyalty and hospitality could render it. At the works on 
the loch, the municipal authorities of Glasgow had made their 
preparations on a magnificent scale. The ceremony was witnessed 
by many thousands of people assembled from Glasgow and the 
neighbouring country. Everything was favourable except the 
weather, and that was dismal. The tunnel opens into the south 
bank of the loch, at a point about a mile and a half to the east of 
Stronachlacher Hotel, where the steam-boat passengers disembark. 
The tunnel thus faces the western extremity of the loch, the upper 
reach of which terminates in the territory of Glengyle, formerly a 



GLASGOW WATEK WORKS. 43 

seat of the Macgregors. Here the hill rises from the loch in a series 
of rugged and irregular terraces, and from a jutting point at the base 
a semicircular alcove has been cut out of the rock, and in the 
centre of it, and below the level of the lake, the tunnel is perforated. 
Embracing this semicircle, and in front of it, an octagonal platform 
was erected, the supporting pillars of which rested on the solid rock, 
some ten or twelve feet below the surface of the water. In the 
centre of tins platform a dais was placed, covered by an open rustic 
temple, the roof of which was thatched with the many-tinted 
juniper, heath, oak, and alder; and, above all, was the royal crown. 
Her Majesty occupied the dais, from the floor of which rose a small 
pillar to the height of three feet, to which was attached an index- 
lever. Her Majesty, by a touch of this instrument, set in motion 
a small hydraulic engine commanding the sluice. The wheel of the 
hydraulic apparatus was thus put in rapid motion, raising the 
sluices j and the water entered for the first time into the tunnel, 
down which it rushed on its mission of purity and health to 
hundreds of thousands. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE GLASGOW WATER WORKS. 

The magnitude and importance of the works will justify the 
insertion in this place of the following particulars of their construc- 
tion and extent, contained in a paper prepared by Mr. Bateman, the 
engineer of the aqueduct, and read by him in the Geological Section 
of the British Association, at the Aberdeen meeting, in 1859 : — 

" The Loch Katrine Aqueduct, for the supply of the City of Glasgow 
with water, is one of the largest works of the kind which has ever been 
constructed in this or any other country, either in ancient or modern 
times. 

The Act for the construction of this work was obtained by the municipal 
authorities, after much careful investigation into the best mode of improving 
the supply of water to the city, in the year 1855, and the works were 
commenced in the following spring. The money for defraying the cost is 
borrowed on security of an unlimited rate upon the houses and property 
within the city. 

The undertaking is specially distinguished by the great extent and 
beauty of the Highland lakes from which the water is brought — the 
excessive purity of the water — the difficult and rugged character of the 
mountainous country through which the works for its conveyance have been 
constructed — and the large volume of water, no less than 50,000,000 
gallons per day, which will be obtained for the supply of the city. 

The lakes appropriated to the purposes of the water-works for the use 
of the city, and for the supply of the millowncrs, fisheries, and other 
interests on the rivers from which the water will be abstracted, are Loch 



44 GLASGOW WATER WORKS. 

Katrine, eight or nine miles in length, with a surface of 3000 acres; Loch 
Vennachar, four miles in length, with an area of 900 acres; and Loch 
Drunkie, with an area of about 150 acres; having altogether a water surface 
of upwards of 4000 acres, and containing within the limits to which they 
may be raised or lowered about 1,600,000,000 cubic feet of water. 

The drainage area of Loch Katrine is 22,800 acres, and of Loch 
Vennachar and Loch Drunkie, 23,000 acres, making a total of 45,800 
acres. On this the average fall of rain is between 70 and 80 inches per 
annum. That which falls on the collecting ground of Loch Katrine is 
about 80 inches on the average of five years' observations. If all tho 
water which flows from the rugged mountain sides into Loch Katrine were 
impounded, it would afford a regular daily supply of 80,000,000 or 
90,000,000 gallons. The storage which is provided by the works which 
have been executed is equal to 50,000,000 gallons per day for 120 days 
without rain. It is obtained by raising the water by proper masonry and 
sluice-gates at the outlet 4 feet above the ordinary summer level, and by 
drawing it down, if necessary, to 3 feet below that level, giving 7 feet in 
depth in all. In like manner the requisite storage for compensation to 
the river Teith, which consists of a regular guaranteed quantity per day, is 
obtained by raising Loch Vennachar 5 feet 8 inches above its ordinary 
summer level, and drawing it down 6 feet, giving 11 feet 8 inches in all, 
and by raising Loch Drunkie 20 feet. 

The works at the outlets of the lakes are interesting and important 
works, at Loch Vennachar especially. Provision is made for the discharge 
of floods as well as for the daily regulated supply, and for securing the 
passage of salmon and other fish by properly constructed " salmon ladders." 

Loch Katrine is 360 feet above the tide at Glasgow, an elevation which 
allows for the loss of fall in the conveyance of the water, and still secures 
a pressure of 70 or 80 feet above the highest summit of land within the city. 

The aqueduct from Loch Katrine to the city is about 34 miles in length, 
10 or 11 of which consist of ridges of rock, of the hardest description, 
forming the spurs of Ben Lomond, which towers to 3000 feet above the 
level of the works. 

Through these ridges, in a tolerably straight direction, the aqueduct is 
carried principally by tunnelling, the tunnels being 8 feet in diameter, and 
having a fall of 10 inches in the mile. Across three deep and wide valleys 
the water is conveyed by cast-iron pipes, 4 feet in diameter, with a fall of 
5 feet per mile, and at the distance of about 26 miles from Loch Katrine, 
near Mugdock Castle, a large reservoir of about 70 acres in extent, and 
containing 500,000,000 gallons of water, has been constructed. 

From this reservoir, the top water of which is 311 feet above the sea, 
the water is taken to the city by two lines of cast-iron pipes, each 3 feet in 
diameter, one being about 7 and the other 8 miles in length. 

Of the 26 miles which lie between Loch Katrine and the service reservoir, 
13 miles are tunnelling, 3| miles are iron piping, and the remainder, where 
the ground has been cut open, is an arched aqueduct of 8 feet in diameter, 



GLASGOW WATER WORKS. 45 

having the same inclination as the tunnels. Where the ground has been 
excavated, it is tilled in again over the aqueduct, which is covered throughout, 
and the surface restored to its original condition. 

There are in the whole work 70 distinct tunnels, upon which 44 vertical 
shafts have been sunk for facilitating and expediting the completion of the 
work. The first tunnel commences immediately upon the aqueduct leaving 
Loch Katrine. It is 2325 yards in length, 600 feet below the summit of 
the hill, and has been worked, in addition to the open ends, by 12 shafts, 
5 of which are nearly 500 feet deep. This tunnel is in gneiss and mica 
slate. The last tunnel is at the southern extremity of the aqueduct, just 
before it enters the service reservoir. It is 2650 yards in length, almost 
wholly through whinstone, at a depth of 250 feet below the summit of the hill. 

Besides these, which are the two longest tunnels, there are, at intermediate 
places, others of 700, 800, 1100, and 1400 yards in length. 

The rock tunnelled through was in most parts of the most obdurate 
description. For several miles along the side of Loch Chon, where the 
work passed through a succession of ridges of mica slate largely mixed with 
quartz veins, the progress did not exceed 3 lineal yards in a month, although 
the work was carried on day and night. In the Loch Katrine Tunnel, and 
generally in the mica' slate, the ordinary average progress was about 5 
yards in a month. In drilling the holes for blasting the rock with gun- 
powder, a fresh drill or chisel was required for every inch in depth upon 
the average. About 60 drills were constantly in use at each face, and the 
cost of gunpowder alone was from 27s. to 30.5. per lineal yard. The 
character of the rock, however (as had been clearly foreseen when the work 
was determined upon), was such that no water occurred in any of the tunnels 
or workings so long as they were in the mica slate and clay slate, and there 
was therefore none of the inconvenience, delay, and cost from the presence 
of water which usually attend extensive tunnelling. When the works left 
the slate rocks and entered the old red sandstone, tunnelling was avoided 
as much as possible from fear of water; but even in this formation it was 
met with in much less quantity than had been anticipated. 

Not to speak of smaller constructions, there are 25 important iron and 
masonry aqueducts over rivers and ravines, some 60 and 80 feet in height^ 
with arches of 30 feet, 50 and 90 feet in span; and in addition to about 
46 miles of new pipes within the city for distributing the water to the 
inhabitants, there are about 20 miles of large cast-iron pipes of 3 feet, 
3 feet 6 inches, and 4 feet in diameter for conveying the water to the city. 

The number of people employed, exclusive of iron founders and mechanics, 
was generally about 3000; and for the greater part of these, huts and 
roads and all other accommodation had to be provided — the country for the 
most part being of the wildest and most inaccessible description. 

The accuracy with which the works have been executed is most creditable 
to the resident engineers and inspectors. The difference between the levels 
taken for Parliamentary purposes and those subsequently taken when the 
works were set out for construction, was only l-50th part of afoot, or

about £ of an inch in the 26 miles between Loch Katrine and the Mugdock 
Reservoir; and so truly have the tunnels been driven, that the junctions 
can only be distinguished by the different directions of the drill holes. 

The works were completed for the conveyance of water to the city within 
3\ vears of the time they were first commenced, and within the time 
originally contemplated, and at a total engineering cost of about £630,000, 
being about 10 per cent, beyond the Parliamentary estimate, after allowing 
for some additional works. 

Before proceeding on the journey to koch Lomond, it is necessary 
here to revert to the route by which Loch Ard may be included in 
the tour of the lakes. 



LOCH AKD. 

The clachan of Aberfoil and Loch Ard may be visited, as has 
been already indicated, by proceeding from the Lake of Menteith, 
from which the clachan is distant about five miles, and the loch 
two miles farther. But there is also a route from the Bridge of 
Turk, and from the upper end of Loch Achray, across the hills to 
Aberfoil, which may be overtaken in a leisurely walk of an hour 
and a half. On ascending the heights above Loch Achray, the 
lake is seen in a new aspect, Ben-an and Ben Venue coming pro- 
minently into view as its northern boundary, with distant inter- 
vening glimpses of the placid waters of Loch Katrine. To the 
left is passed Loch Drunkie, occupying an area of 150 acres in the 
hollow of the hills, whence it sends its superfluous waters to the 
lower level of Loch Vennachar. The hill-path from the Bridge of 
Turk, soon after crossing a secluded valley clad with birches and 
ferns, emerges upon the road from the upper end of Loch Achray, 
which is now followed directly on to Aberfoil The Highland 
line is nowhere more sharply drawn than where this hill-road 
descends abruptly upon the low country at Aberfoil; nor could 
any part of the Highland frontier more forcibly illustrate the obser- 
vation quoted by Scott, for its truth and taste, from the writings 
of Lady Mary "Wortley Montague, "that the most romantic region 
of every country is that where the mountains unite themselves with 
the plains or lowlands." The contrast betwixt the rude territory 
we have crossed, w T ith its lofty hills, deep valleys, bleak moors, 
and turbulent streams, and the extensive plain of Menteith, 
which comes suddenly in sight, traversed by the river flowing 
" narrow, deep, still, and silent," through green meadows and rich 
plantations, is alike striking and beautiful. "That's the Forth," 



THE FORTH— ABERFOIL. 4.7 

said Bailie Nicol Jarvie, " with an air of reverence," remarks his 
English fellow-traveller, " which I have observed the Scotch usually- 
pay to their distinguished rivers." And the discerning stranger 
from whatever land, who first looks down from the precipitous 
terrace above Aberfoil, upon the quiet woodlands and cultivated 
fields of the plain of Menteith, where the infant Forth, reinforced by 
the waters of Loch Ard, its second principal source, has already begun 
to trace those winding "links" which add at once to the beauty 
and length of its course, will be not less indulgent than Francis 
Osbaldistone to the admiration with which a Scotsman regards one 
of the proudest of his native rivers, destined to bear upon its tides 
the ships of every nation. The geological structure of this part of 
the country accounts for the distinctness of the frontier line. In 
passing from Loch Achray to Aberfoil, we cross nearly the entire 
breadth of the zone of clay-slate which has been already pointed 
out as constituting the southern margin of the great mica-schist 
formation • and the abrupt descent upon the plain of the Forth 
marks the transition to the old red sandstone, which forms a broad 
belt running parallel with the clay-slate from Stonehaven to the 
Frith of Clyde. 

The descent from the hill-road terminates at the inn of Aber- 
foil, not far from the old bridge, "very high and very narrow," 
which still spans the Forth. In the fierce old times, when " the 
Forth bridled the wild Highlandman," this was the only pass from 
the Highlands to the Lowlands, except the Fords of Frew, at a 
lower part of the river, till the stream could be crossed at the Bridge 
of Stirling. The river here is only about forty-five feet above the 
level of the frith at Stirling. From the inn, which is the scene 
of some of the incidents introduced in the novel of Eob Boy, and 
is duly designated by the clear and venerable name of Bailie Nicol 
Jarvie, the distance is a mile or less to the clachan of Aberfoil, 
along a road skirted by an ample growth of dwarf oaks, which are 
periodically cut down and barked for tanning purposes, the wood 
being also used in the neighbourhood for the distillation of pyro- 
ligneous acid. The Forth here receives an accession to its streams 
from the water of Duchray. The Pass of Aberfoil opens into the 
craggy heights on the north, and is the scene of the defeat of a 
detachment of Cromwell's troops by Graham of Duchray. Tho 
little hamlet named the Clachan, although still sufficiently primitive 
in its style of architecture, has yielded in a reasonable measure to 
the progress of modern improvement ; the visitor must not expect, 
therefore, to recognise in the comparatively comfortable cottages of 



48 CLACHAN Or ABERFOIL-LOCH ARD. 

the villagers "the miserable little bonrocJcs, as the Bailie termed 
them, of which about a dozen formed the clachan, composed of 
loose stones, cemented by clay instead of mortar, and thatched by 
turfs, laid rudely upon rafters formed of native and unhewn birches 
and oaks." The neighbourhood, since the days when the Duke of 
Montrose had his feuds with Rob Roy, has been found to produce 
excellent limestone, which the present Duke encourages his tenantry 
to employ both in masonry and manuring ; and the hills at no great 
distance, as the traveller southwards must have observed, are quarried 
for slates. With better methods and materials of construction, the 
cottage roofs, also, are no longer pitched so near the ground as to 
incur any danger to modern travellers of the nature described by 
Andrew Fairservice, when he shrewdly observed, " that we might 
have ridden over the village the night before, and never found out 
we were near it, unless our horses' feet had gane through the 
riggin'." The surrounding scene is sketched with a vigorous and 
truthful hand by the novelist : — 

" I shall never forget the delightful sensation with which I exchanged 
the dark, smoky, smothering atmosphere of the Highland hut, in which 
we had passed the night so uncomfortably, for the refreshing fragrance of 
the morning air, and the glorious beams of the rising sun, which, from a 
tabernacle of purple and golden clouds, were darted full on such a scene 
of natural romance and beauty as had never before greeted my eyes. 
To the left lay the valley, down which the Forth wandered on its easterly 
course, surrounding the beautiful detached hill, with all its garland of 
woods. On the right, amid a profusion of thickets, knolls, and crags, lay 
the bed of a broad mountain lake, lightly curled into tiny waves by the 
breath of the morning breeze, each glittering in its course under the 
influence of the sunbeams. High hills, rocks, and banks, waving with 
natural forests of birch and oak, formed the borders of this enchanting 
sheet of water ; and as their leaves rustled to the wind and twinkled in 
the sun, gave to the depth of solitude a sort of life and vivacity." 

Loch Ard is four miles in length and one in breadth. Connected 
with it by the same river is Loch Chon, further to the west, and 
two miles and a half in length, and three quarters of a mile in 
breadth. The finest view of Loch Ard is obtained, by general 
consent, at an elevated part of the road after passing the clachan, 
where only a portion of the lake first comes in sight, separated from 
the main expanse of water by a wooded promontory, with Ben- 
lomond rising in the background in one of its most graceful and 
dignified aspects. As we advance through woods and meadowlands, 
and emerge from the forest ground, the whole lake gradually expands 
into an uninterrupted and placid sheet of water. The northern 



LOCH ARD— WATERFALL OF LEDEARD. 49 

shore is broken into an irregular outline by promontories and inden- 
tations, and is bounded by cliffs of no great height, but exhibiting 
all the charms of the Highland forest, its oaks and birches running 
down to the water's edge, or overhanging the precipices. The 
opposite bank, retiring westward in the direction of Loch Chon, 
displays tracts of cultivated land, interspersed with farm-steadings, 
in which unpretending appearance the upper extremity of the loch 
also begins to partake. In an islet of this part of the loch are the 
remains of a stronghold of Murdock Duke of Albany. Loch Ard 
has been pronounced by the critical Macculloch to be " pleasing" 
rather than grand. Its finely commingled elements of mountain, 
wood, and water entitle it, at least, to be distinguished as eminently 
romantic. For this reason its scenery was chosen by Sir Walter 
Scott for some interesting incidents in two of his novels. The 
low rocky promontory forming the most outstanding feature of 
the northern shore, is the scene of the collision between the 
Macgregors and the red coats; and the guide or boatman who 
conducts you would be a bungler in his craft, if he could not point 
out the precise cliff, up the face of which Andrew Fairservice 
scrambled, during the fray, with the activity of a wild cat; and 
the identical branch of the veritable ragged thorn which caught 
hold of the Bailie's riding-coat, and suspended him in mid-air, 
"where he dangled not unlike to the sign of the Golden Fleece 
over the door of a mercer in the Trongate of his native city." On 
the northern side of the loch, near its upper extremity, is the 
waterfall of Ledeard, on the farm of that name, and which was a 
favourite object of Sir Walter Scott's, he having introduced it both 
into Eoy Roy and Waverley. In the former tale, it is the scene of 
the pacific meeting of Bailie Jarvie and Osbaldistone with Helen 
Macgregor; in the latter it is the place where Flora Mac-Ivor 
receives and entertains Edward Waverley (somewhat theatrically, 
it must be owned) with her translation of a Gaelic song, celebrating 
the unfurling of the flag of the Stuarts by Prince Charles Edward. 
The description of the fall in the latter-mentioned work is as 
follows : — 

" At a short turning, the path, which had for some furlongs lost sight 
of the brook, suddenly placed Waverley in front of a romantic waterfall. 
It was not so remarkable either for great height or quantity of water, as 
for the beautiful accompaniments which made the spot interesting. After 
a broken cataract of about twenty feet, the stream was received in a large 
natural basin filled to the brim with water, which, where the bubbles of 
the fall subsided, was so exquisitely clear, that although it was of great

this reservoir, the brook found its way as if over a broken part of the 
ledge, and formed a second fall, which seemed to seek the very abyss, 
then wheeling out beneath from among the smooth dark rocks, which it 
had polished for ages, it wandered murmuring down the glen, forming the 
stream up which Waverley had just ascended." — " It is (adds Sir Walter 
in a note) upon a small scale, but otherwise one of the most exquisite 
cascades it is possible to behold." 

The pedestrian has it in his option to strike across the left 
shoulder of Benlomond, by a footpath from Loch Ard, and thus 
lvach Rowardennan, on the side of Loch Lomond; or he may 
proceed from Loch Ard to Loch Chon, which possesses attractions 
not less powerful to the lover of the picturesque, and thence reach 
the road leading from Loch Katrine to Inversnaid. 



LNTERSNAID. 

On landing at Stronachlachar, the Loch Katrine passengers find 
coaches awaiting them, by which they are conveyed to Inversnaid, 
on Loch Lomond. The road across the country, about five miles in 
length, has been much improved of late years, and the vehicles are 
under proper regulation. Travellers by the established conveyances 
are no longer subjected to the levying of "black mail," a practice 
which, originating with the ancient caterans of Glengyle, descended 
to our own times, being practised (mutatis mutandis) till a recent 
period by the Highland gillies upon all lawful travellers by lake 
and land. The small bleak lake of Arklet lies to the left of the 
road. Helen Macgregor, the wife of Rob Roy, is said to have been 
born on its banks. On approaching Inversnaid, the ruins of the 
fort of that name are seen surmounting a hillock on the right. 
Inversnaid Fort was erected by Government in the year 1713, to 
over-awe the Macgregors, then a formidable clan of marauders, and 
much compromised, two years afterwards, in the Jacobite movement 
of the time, Rob Roy having been " out " in the Earl of Mar's year. 
It was twice surprised by this bold outlaw. The forfc was also 
employed for military purposes after the rebellion of 1745, it having 
been put into a state of repair subsequently to the battle of Culloden. 
In 1746, it was garrisoned by Wolfe, afterwards the hero of Quebec, 
who was detached to the fort with his company. Although the fort 
is, therefore, not without some historical interest, it has been allowed 
to full into a very dilapidated state, little more remaining than one 
of the walls, the rest of the ruins having furnished materials for 
the adjacent farm-buildings. In a contiguous patch of ground are 



WATERFALLS AT INVERSNAID. 51 

interred one or two of the former military tenants of the fort. The 
stream issuing from Loch Arklet, and flowing to the left of the 
road, becomes a dark and deep flowing torrent as it descends towards 
Loch Lomond, which it reaches by a series of cascades. The finest 
of these falls is the one at Inversnaid, celebrated by Wordsworth, 
in his lines "to a Highland Girl," which will always link themselves 
with the recollections of one of the sweetest and most tranquil spots 
on Loch Lomond, although Inversnaid has lost much of its natural 
simplicity in the progress of the improvements of late years, and 
is indeed greatly more artificial in its accessories than when it was 
visited by the poet :— 

" Sweet Highland girl, a very shower 
Of beauty is thy earthly dower ! 
Twice seven consenting years have shed 
Their utmost beauty on thy head : 
And these grey rocks ; this household lawn ; 
These trees, a veil just half withdrawn ; 
This fall of water that doth make 
A murmur near the silent lake ; 
This little bay, a quiet road 
That holds in shelter thy abode ; 
In truth together ye do seem 
Like something fashioned in a dream ; 
Such forms as from their covert peep 
When earthly cares are laid asleep. 
Yet dream and vision as thou art, 
I bless thee with a human heart. 



Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart, 
Sweet Highland girl! from thee to part; 
For I, methinks, till I grow old, 
As fair before me shall behold, 
As I do now, the cabin small, 
The lake, the bay, the waterfall, 
And thee, the spirit of them all." 

Another fall of the same rivulet, generally overlooked, may be 
seen by deviating from the winding road into the wooded ravine, 
midway between the inn and the shooting-lodge of Archibald Orr 
Ewing, Esq., which is first observed on approaching Inversnaid, 
perched upon an elevated plateau commanding a striking prospect 
of lake and mountain. This cascade is in a different style of 
beauty from that of the lower fall, celebrated by the poet, and, 
unlike it, still preserves its primitive simplicity. The torrent, as it 
descends into a corrie thickly clad with wild-wood, breaks over a 



53 ROB ROY MACGREGOR. 

series of rocky ledges, and sweeps suddenly out of view into the 
chasm from which it finally emerges to plunge into the loch at the 
lower fall. Those who, in Wordsworthian phrase, feel delight in 
" hunting the waterfalls," will find this isolated bit of scenery an 
exquisite little picture. On the roadside, betwixt the lake and the 
fort, are to be observed several veins of red felspathic trap pene- 
trating the mica-schist, 'and exhibiting interesting junctions of the 
igneous and stratified rocks. The trap has been quarried for 
road-metal, and is readily distinguished from the grey schist by 
its ruddy colour. 

Early in the eighteenth century, Inversnaid and the adjoining 
lands on the borders of Benlomond were in possession of Eob Eoy 
Macgregor, by whom they had been honourably acquired. At that 
period, in consequence of his family name being proscribed, he 
had assumed the name of Campbell, in compliment to his patron 
the Duke of Argyle, and was engaged in the honest pursuit of 
a drover or cattle-dealer, an undertaking in which many Scottish 
gentlemen embarked after the union with England. Robert 
Macgregor Campbell was enabled to commence business with 
funds advanced to him by his neighbours, including, it is said, the 
Duke of Montrose, on the understanding that the lenders were to 
share in the profits. He prosecuted his new calling for some time 
with spirit and success, but becoming involved by the defalcations 
of an agent or partner, he drew bills on some of his employers for 
cattle he was to buy for them, and realising the money, fled without 
making the purchases, and was denounced as a notour and fraudulent 
bankrupt. It so happens, therefore, that the first public notice we 
have of Eob Eoy, who was destined to be the hero of legend, song, 
and romance, in future years, is in the shape of an announcement 
in an Edinburgh newspaper, of date June 21, 1712, that "Eobert 
Campbell, commonly known by the name of Eob Eoy Macgregor, 
being lately intrusted by several noblemen and gentlemen with 
considerable sums for buying cows for them in the Highlands, has 
treacherously gone off with the money, to the value of £1000 
sterling, which he carries along with him." Fraudulent bankruptcy 
was not in those times viewed with a lenient eye, and Macgregor 
was pursued with unrelenting severity, although, perhaps, the 
transaction which made him a broken man was one in which he 
was as much sinned against as sinning. The Duke of Montrose, 
especially, showed his resentment by ordering his factor, Mr. Graham 
of Killearn, to thrust the wife and children of Macgregor out 
of house and hold at Inversnaid and Craig-Eoyston. Erom that 



ROB ROY MACGREGOR-niS CAVE ON THE LOCH. 53 

time Rob Roy became a lawless man, a cateran and cattle-lifter, 
living by the pillage of his neighbours' property, and reserving his 
heaviest levies for the pasture-lands and granaries of his Ducal 
oppressor. The Government, with the view of keeping him in 
check, built the fort at Inversnaid, an undertaking which was not 
without difficulty, as during its erection the masons were surprised 
by Rob Roy's people, on a winter night, and dragged through the 
snow, half-naked, to a place at some distance, whence they were 
dismissed, thankful to escape with their lives. About a mile above 
Inversnaid, there is a cave hollowed out of the craggy rock, in 
which the outlaw is said to have sometimes found shelter and 
security. It is only accessible by boat, and is scarcely perceptible 
from the steamer in consequence of the huge blocks of stone which 
conceal the entrance. Notwithstanding his wild life and defiance 
of the law, Macgregor obtained to some extent the confidence 
and protection of the two chiefs of the Campbells, Argyle and 
Breadalbane. He was " out," as has been already seen, in the year 
1715, and marched under the banner of Mar for the Pretender, but 
remained conspicuously inactive in the fight at Sheriffmuir. When 
General Wade, nine years afterwards (1724) received the humble 
submissions of many of the insurgents, none was more servile 
than Rob Roy's, who wished it to appear that his treason to the 
crown was involuntary on his part : — " It was my misfortune (he 
wrote) at the time the rebellion broke out, to be liable to legal diligence 
and caption, at the Duke of Montrose's instance, for debt alleged 
due to him. To avoid being flung into prison, as I must certainly 
have been, had I followed my real inclinations in joining the king's 
troops at Stirling, I was forced to take party with the adherents of 
the Pretender ; for the country being all in arms, it was neither safe 
nor possible for me to stand neuter." Furthermore, and here we 
have the outlaw's admission that he could be treacherous as well as 
politic and crafty — " I not only avoided acting offensively against his 
Majesty's forces upon all occasions, but, on the contrary, sent his 
grace the Duke of Argyle all the intelligence I could from time to 
time of the situation and strength of the rebels ; which I hope his 
grace will do me the justice to acknowledge." In 1716, Rob Roy 
retaliated upon the Duke of Montrose, by arresting his factor when 
he was collecting the termly rents from the tenantry, and conveying 
him to one of the islets in Loch Katrine as a prisoner. Next year, 
the outlaw was arrested by the Duke of Athole, when he made a 
dexterous escape at Logierait. In subsequent years he levied black- 
mail, entering into engagements for protection from cattle-lifting, on 

a

payment to him of an annual sum of money.* He is supposed to 
have died about the year 1738. Of his five sons, the youngest, 
Robert Oig by name, was hanged in Edinburgh in 1754, for the 
forcible abduction and marriage of a youthful widow, named Jean 
Key, residing in the parish of Balfron; and James, the instigator 
and chief promoter of this outrage, who had been previously put 
upon his trial, but escaped before the final decision of the court, 
died miserably in France in 1754. 

From the landing place at Inversnaid the tourist may embark by 
one of the fine steam-boats plying on the loch for Tarbet on the 
opposite side, and thence proceed to Arrochar and Loch Long; or, 
following the usual course, sail down the loch to Balloch, and there 
take the train for Glasgow. But Loch Lomond deserves a long day 
for itself; and it is visited to most advantage by means of the steamer 
leaving Balloch on the arrival of the morning train from Glasgow. 



BENLOMOND. 
Benlomond, 3191 feet high, consists of mica schist, intersected 
by veins of quartz, and exhibiting frequent flexures and contortions 
in the strata. The same rock, as has been already observed, con- 
tributes to the finest of our lake and mountain scenery. Loch 
Katrine, Loch Tay, Loch Awe, Loch Long, Loch Goil, and other 
lakes more or less notable, belong to this system, which also gives 
rise to the picturesque group of hills known as the Arrochar alps or 
the Duke of Argyle's Bowling-green, and the mountains encircling the 
Trosachs. On the opposite shore of Loch Lomond, at Tarbet, the 
mica-schist merges into chlorite schist. None of the Scottish moun- 
tains is so frequently ascended by tourists as Benlomond, partly 
because the task is attended with little difficulty or fatigue, and 

* An interesting account of Rob Roy is to be found in the introduction to Sir 
Walter Scott's novel of that name. Some particulars of the outlaw's life also 
occur in the "Domestic Annals of Scotland," by R. Chambers, vol. iii. "It is 
curious to reflect (says the latter writer) that this strange exemplification of 
predatory life was realised in a not very remote part of our island, in the days 
when Addison and Pope were regaling the refined people of London with the pro- 
ductions of their genius." The contrast presents itself not less strikingly in a fact 
mentioned by Sir Walter Scott. When Rob Roy was sent by the Earl of Mar 
to Aberdeen to raise a part of the clan Gregor settled in that country, the outlaw 
held friendly and familiar intercourse with Dr. James Gregory (whom he claimed 
as a kinsman), Professor of Medicine in King's College, and son of Dr. James 
Gregory, the inventor of the reflecting telescope. By way of showing his sense of 
the Professor's hospitality, Rob insisted on being permitted to take his youngest 
son with him to the Highlands, on the assurance that he would " make a man of 
him ! " The circumstance is noted by Sir Walter as bringing the highest pitch of 
civilisation closely in contact with the half-savage state of society. 





y 




VIEW FROM BENLOMOND. 55 

partly on account of the extent and variety of the view obtained 
from the summit. The ascent is usually commenced at Rowardennan 
Inn, from which a pony-path leads to the very top of the hill, but 
an equally good route may be followed by starting from Inversnaid. 
The eastern side of the summit breaks into a wild precipice 
descending into a profound and gloomy valley, where the Forth is 
seen springing from the mountain side; and in this direction are- 
descried the hills overlooking Loch Katrine, with the alpine ranges of 
Loch Tay and Loch Earn in the distance. Turning towards the 
south-east, the prospect takes in the vale of Menteith, the Links of 
Forth, with the Castle-rock of Stirling rising abruptly in the long 
level carse; and under favourable circumstances, the eye may 
discern the remote but marked outlines of Arthur's Seat and Salis- 
bury Crags. Still further southwards, the course of the Clyde is 
easily recognised, and the position of Glasgow will be usually indi- 
cated by the pall of smoke which permanently invests the western 
metropolis. From the strongly denned form of Dumbarton Castle, 
the eye is directed up the vale of Leven, and thence back to Loch 
Lomond itself, which, seen from the heights of Benlomond, is after 
all the most charming portion of the picture. On the western 
aspect, portions of Loch Long are revealed amongst the intricacies 
of the Arrochar hills, prominent amongst which is the Cobbler, 
familiar from his singularly shaped peaks ; a few miles to the north, 
springing from the west side of Loch Lomond, to a height of 3160 
feet, is Ben Voirlich; and as the eye sweeps round the line of the 
northern horizon, it descries the summits of Ben Cruachan, Benmore, 
and Ben Lawers, with an ocean of mountain tops between. The 
finest views of the lake are obtained from heights considerably lower 
than the top, where, indeed, a large portion of the expanse of water 
is shut out by the shoulder of the mountain. The lake presents 
itself in an endless variety of picturesque and pleasing forms, when 
viewed from different points in the ascent. Amongst these partial 
views, Dr. Macculloch points out one at about a third or fourth of the 
ascent, as being amongst the finest general pictures of Loch Lomond, 
similar in style to that from the hill of Luss, and not much inferior 
in magnificence. " It includes (he observes) the whole of the lower 
and wide part of the lake, with all its islands, a splendid and 
dazzling expanse, and, with some contrivance in the management of 
the nearer grounds, not incapable of being painted, although 
approaching to the character of a bird's-eye view." Benlomond has 
been too much frequented during the last quarter of a century to 
have retained some of the rarer alpine plants for which it was at one

time celebrated amongst botanists. Azalea procumbens, it is to be 
feared, has been extirpated, but the subjoined list of the more 
interesting plants of the mountain will show that it is by no means 
deficient in common alpine species.* The botanist who visits this 
region for the purpose of collecting alpine plants, however, is 
recommended to give the preference to Ben Voirlich, which is 
ascended from a point on the loch-side nearly equidistant from Tar- 
bet and Inverarnan. It is a stiff hill to climb, and to botanise it to 
good purpose will occupy a long summer day.t

SOUNDINGS OF LOCH LOMOND. 57 

LOCH LOMOND. 
Loch Lomond (according to the map of the Ordnance Survey, 
published in 1862,) is nearly twenty-two miles in length, and four 
in breadth at its widest expanse. In the course of the survey, in 
1861, it was systematically sounded throughout its entire length, 
under the direction of Captain H. C. Otter, E.N. At its widest 
part, betwixt Eoss-dhu and Endrick-mouth, the soundings show 
an average depth of fifty-seven feet. The water attains its maximum 
depth at a mile and a quarter above Tarbet, betwixt Blarannich on 
the left and Culness on the right side, where the soundings reached 
a hundred and five fathoms, or six hundred and thirty feet. From 
this point to the head of the loch, a distance of six miles, with an 
average width of half a mile, the depth gradually diminishes to 
fifteen fathoms. Midway betwixt Tarbet and the opposite bank, 
the greatest depth is eighty-three fathoms, or four hundred and 
ninety-eight feet. Betwixt Inveruglas and Rowardennan, where 
the water of Douglas flows into the loch at the former place, the 
depth is diminished to ten or eleven fathoms; at Luss, and around 
the neighbouring island of Inch-Lonaig, there is a depth varying 
from eighteen to twenty fathoms ; the average is still less where the 
islands are clustered, betwixt Inch-Tavannach and Inch-Cailliach; 
and from Inch-Murrin to the lower end of the loch, the soundings 
are from ten and twelve to five fathoms. In consequence of its 
great depth in the upper part, the water never freezes; and the 
lower portion is only frozen in winters of extreme severity. Like 
Loch Ness, the waters of Loch Lomond are said to have suddenly 
risen and surged upon the banks during the earthquake by which 
Lisbon was destroyed in 1755. The principal tributary of the lake 
is the river Endrick, which enters it on the north-east, but it is 
also fed at the upper end by the river Falloch, and four miles below 
by Inveruglas water, lower down by the waters of Douglas and 
Luss, and by innumerable rivulets and torrents along its mountain 
boundaries. Its outlet is at the lower end, forming Leven water, 
which, flowing through the valley of that name, celebrated in 
Smollett's ode for rural beauties which have in great measure dis- 
appeared before the spread of printfields and dye-works, pours its 
polluted stream into the Clyde at Dumbarton Castle.* The direction 
of the lake is nearly due north and south. 

* Smollett's enumeration of the fishes of the Leven must now be transferred to 
the loch, which is much frequented by ang'ers : — 

" The springing trout, in speckled pride, 
The salmon, monarch of the tide, 
The ruthless pike, intent on war, 
The silver eel, and mottled par." 



58 ANCIENT GLACIERS-THE POWAN OF LOCH LOMOND. 

The loch has been known by its present name since the four- 
teenth century, previous to which it was called Lyncaledur, 
signifying " Lake of the wooded waters." In ancient times 
Loch Lomond enjoyed a superstitious renown for having "waves 
without wind, fish without fins, and a floating island," — "fisch 
Bwomand but [swimming without] ony fyn," wrote the quaint and 
credulous Hector Boece, and after him Bellenden. It is only within 
a recent period in the progress of geological research that the 
probable origin of lakes has become a subject of investigation; and 
Professor Ramsay, President of the London Geological Society, 
has arrived at the conclusion, after examining the lakes of Switzer- 
land, that Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, in common with these 
lakes, are examples of glacier erosion. Certain it is, that the surfaces 
of the rocks in and on the margin of Loch Lomond are grooved, 
striated, rounded, and polished, presenting similar appearances to 
those produced by the abrading force of moving glaciers in the Swiss 
valleys. Even when observed from the deck of the steam-boat, the 
rocks on some of the islands exhibit the aspect of roches mouton- 
nees. An instance of such grooved and polished surfaces is very 
obvious on the rocky shore at Rowardennan landing-place. Similar 
markings occur in the whole course of Loch Long and especially of 
Gareloch. The probability of this entire region having been at one 
time subjected to ice-action is increased by the fact of arctic shells, 
now generally ascribed to the glacial period, being found on the 
banks of Loch Lomond, in common with the shores of the Clyde 
and its estuary, and of the west and north coasts of Scotland. The 
shells are found in a clay bed on the border of a small stream 
running into the lake near Balmaha, and include Tellina proximo, 
and Cyprlna Islandiea, both unequivocally of arctic origin; together 
with B ilanus porcatus and Saxicava ruyosa, usually associated with 
these species in the glacial deposits. The occurrence of the povvan 
(Coregonus Lacepedei) amongst the fishes of Loch Lomond is thus 
noticed in Sibbald's work on the natural history of Scotland, in 
1684: — "Poana, AnguilLse species in Lacu Leimonio;" but its 
existence in Loch Lomond exclusively, as a distinct species of the 
genus Coregonus, has been determined only within a comparatively 
recent period.* 

* The following note on this subject is from the pen of Robert Gray, Esq., 
Secretary to the Glasgow Natural History Society, to whom the writer is also 
indebted for the notices of the Quadrupeds, Birds, and Fishes of Loch Lomond 
and its vicinity, subsequently inserted: — 

44 The genus Coregonus, to which the powan belongs, now includes a number of 
species. These have chiefly been discovered during the last thirty years. In the 



GEOLOGY OF LOCH LOMOND. 59 

The upper region of the loch consists of mica-schist. The middle 
region is traversed by the band of clay-slate which has been repeat- 
edly mentioned, and is wrought at the quarries of Luss and 
Camstradden. The lower division, bounded by the flat land 
stretching away eastwards, and embracing the district of the 
Lennox and Menteith, belongs to the old red sandstone, the junction 
of which with the clay-slate takes place near the Pass of Balmaha. 
Between Luss and Tarbet the mica-slate is intermingled with talc 
slate, also veins of greenstone and porphyry; and chlorite slate 
occurs on the shore near the latter village. It is observable that 
the islands in the middle division of the loch, where the mica-slate 
and clay-slate must have come into juxtaposition, consist exclusively 
of the more enduring of the rocks, leading to the inference that the 
softer argillaceous masses have been removed by denudation. Apart 
from inequalities in the level of the water occasioned by droughts 
and heavy rains, its tendency upon the whole is to rise and encroach 
upon the shore. Several ancient land-marks, including the remains 
of buildings, have been submerged in the course of centuries. This 
increase of the surface is due simply to the gradual accumulation of 
silt at the outlet of the lake, and not to any geological elevation of 
its foundations. 

British islands there are at present four species recognised as distinct — the Gwyniad- 
powan (Cor. fera), found abundantly in the lakes of Cumberland; the vendace 
(C. Willughbii). peculiar to the lakes in the neighbourhood of Lochmaben ; the 
powan (C. Lacepedei), restricted to Loch Lomond ; and the pollan (C. Pollan), which 
is confined to two or three loughs in Ireland. These four, previous to 1830, were 
confounded with each other by British writers, the only described species being the 
Gwyniad. Sir William Jardine discovered the vendace to be distinct, the late 
William Thompson the pollan, and Mons. Noel the powan. 

"On referring to Yarrell's work on 'British Fishes,' the following remarks 
occur : — " Dr. Parnell has described in the first volume of the ' Annals of Natural 
History ' a species of Coregonus, to which he has attached the name of Lacepedei, 
this species having been first noticed, or perhaps distinguished, by the celebrated 
French naturalist. This fish is found in Loch Lomond." . . . . " It appears, 
on reference to his ' Natural History of Fishes,' that Lacepede became aware of the 
existence of this Coregonus in Loch Lomond by the communication of M. Noel, 
who visited Scotland in 1802." It was not, however, until 1837 that the species 
was admitted into the British Fauna, Dr. Richard Parnell, author of the prize essay 
on the Fishes of the Frith of Forth, having in that year exhibited specimens of all the 
British Coregoni at a meeting of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, including the 
Loch Lomond powan, for which he proposed the new name of Lacepedei in honour of 
its first describer, a name which it now retains in all works on ichthyology since 
published." 

Mr. Gray adds that the powan is abundant in various parts of Loch Lomond, and 
attracts attention by its habit of approaching the shore towards nightfall, the shoal 
making a commotion in the water with their fins. On such occasions, great 
quantities are taken with draught-nets. Although it has been affirmed that the 
powan will not tcuch a bait, Mr. M'Niven, an experienced angler, has sometimes 
caught it with a common worm, when fishing for perch. The powan is excellent 
when used as food, but, although taken in sufficient numbers, has never found its

The geological structure of the region encircling the loch gives 
rise to the characteristic features of its three divisions. The upper 
part takes its bold alpine character from the primary schist; and 
the lower extremity, from the later deposits of the old red sandstone; 
while the picturesque archipelago which forms the intermediate 
division, and confers on the loch its crowning ornament, owes its 
origin, in all probability, to the different resisting powers of two 
descriptions of rocks here brought into contact, and which, in a 
remote geological era, were equally exposed to the abrading action 
of ice and the force of running water. The long undulating outline 
of the banks at the lower end is interrupted at intervals by head- 
lands or Rosses, and soft verdant meadows retire upon the uplands, 
which contract in the direction of Balloch to form the embouchure 
of the loch. The islands, great and small, are about thirty in 
number, and exhibit a remarkable diversity of form, vegetation, and 
colouring. Some of them spring craggy and precipitous to a con- 
siderable height, luxuriantly covered with dark pines, light waving 
birches, dwarf oaks, and a rich undergrowth of shrubs and ferns, 
which in the flush of summer put forth every shade of green, and 
when the mellow hues of autumn are on their foliage, present that 
gorgeous colouring which then so remarkably characterises the 
wildwoods of the Highland lakes and valleys. The surface of others 
is broken into bare rocky ledges, intermingled with tufts of trees; 
some are bleak of aspect, and nearly destitute of vegetation ; others 
rise only a few yards above the lake, with their long, smooth, 
undulating surfaces clothed with greensward, thinly dotted with 
trees, and showing at a distance like emerald plains amidst the dark 
waters; and here and there is an islet so tiny and green, and 
having an air so dreamy and buoyant withal, that we might fancy 
it the fairy island of former times, floating double with its shadow, 
like the swan, in the tranquil and transparent depths. 

At Balloch station the trains converging from the Glasgow and 
Stirling lines transfer their passengers to the steam-boat, which is 
equipped with every modern improvement. In the cabin is placed 
an elegant piece of work in Sevres porcelain, the gift of the Empress 
Eugenie, in testimony of her sense of the attention paid to her on 
the occasion of her visiting Loch Lomond some years ago. On the 
left of the Leven, which here commences its course to the Clyde, is 
seen the tower of Tillichewan Castle, situated on a rising ground 
finely ornamented with old trees (the property of William Campbell, 
Esq.) Overlooking the loch, to the right, is Balloch Castle (Alex- 
ander Dennistoun Brown, Esq.) Near the lower extremity of the 



GLEN FUUIN-CLAN FEUDS AND FORAYS. Ql 

loch, on the left, Cameron House (Alexander Smollett, Esq. M P 
descended from the novelist and historian), occupies a prominent 
site on the shore, embosomed in plantations. On the right, 
where the loch expands eastwards, is Botturich Castle (Colonel 
Einlay); m the same direction is Ross Priory (Sir G. Leith, Bart,); 
and the stately mansion named Buchanan House, the' seat of 
the Duke of Montrose, is a prominent object amidst woods and 
lawns on the further bank of the loch, near to the point where 
it receives the water of Endrick. From this part of the lake may 
be obtained a view of the monument to George Buchanan, the 
celebrated scholar and Latin poet, and tutor of James VI. ; it is 
erected in his native village of Killearn, situated on the uplands 
to the south-east. 

Turning to the left, there will be observed the ruins of the old 
feudal Castle of Bannochra, or Bannochar, overhanging the opening of 
Glen Fruin, and in ancient times the residence of the Colquhouns. 
The rivulet of the Eruin flows through a rugged and lonely valley, 
which forms an attractive resort to visitors from Helensburgh and 
Gareloch on the Clyde, and enters Loch Lomond nearly opposite the 
southern end of Inch-Murrin. Glen Fruin, or the Glen of Sorrow, 
was the scene of a celebrated conflict between the Macgregors and 
Colquhouns, in the year 1 603. The district of the Lennox, the old 
name given to the country surrounding the lower part of Loch 
Lomond, was in former times peculiarly liable to the incursions of 
rival clans. Those of Macfarlane, Macaulay, and Colquhoun, when 
they were not employed in plundering each other, not unfrequently 
combined to sweep the low country of its flocks and herds. The 
Campbells, the Camerons, and the Buchanans were not slow at the 
same time to mingle in fray and foray. In the year mentioned 
above, Colquhoun of Luss arrived in his territory with a commission 
to proceed against " thievis, sornaris, and broken men " infesting 
the Lennox, at the conjuncture when Macgregor of Glenstrae had 
invaded his lands with a following of four hundred men. Colquhoun 
summoned his vassals and neighbours to his aid, and re-inforced by 
a contingent of the burghers of Dumbarton (under command of 
Tobias Smollett, ancestor of the author of that name), attacked the 
marauders in the valley of Glen Fruin. Victory, however, declared for 
the Macgregors, who carried off immense booty in cattle, sheep, and 
horses. A legend bears that some students of the clerical profession 
from Dumbarton, who were merely spectators of the fight, were 
massacred by the victors in cold blood; but it does not appear to be 
supported by the historical records which have been brought to

light on the subject.* Of Colquhoun's men a hundred and forty 
Were slain, including many of the landed proprietors of the neigh- 
bourhood, t The laird of Luss was indebted for his escape to the 
fleetness of his steed, which carried him to his stronghold at 
Bannochra. He was, however, soon after murdered in a vault of the 
castle, — by the Macgregors, say the family annals; but according to 
other accounts, by the Macfarlanes. The vengeance of the law 
descended upon the clan Macgregor, whose whole race were pro- 
scribed, their name prohibited, and their children exiled from their 
native land. Macgregor of Glenstrae was tried before the Court of 
Justiciary in 1604, and being found guilty, was instantly executed. 
Repeated edicts were issued by James VI. and Charles I. against 
this hapless clan, which the policy of the time doomed to extinction, 
but which maintained its existence and continued to be formidable 
throughout a prolonged period of fell oppression, provoking fierce 
and frequent retaliations. Its power in the time of Rob Eoy, nearly 
a century after the fight of Glen Fruin, has been indicated in previous 
references to the history of the period. During the latter part of 
the eighteenth century the clan was allowed to live at peace; and 
the Macgregors, gradually acquiring the habits of civilised life, 
at length had their name and privileges restored by the British 
Parliament in 1774, when Murray of Lanrick, afterwards Sir John 
Macgregor, Bart., was acknowledged as the head of the clan Macgregor. 
During the last war, many of the clan formed themselves into a 
regiment bearing the name of Clan Alpine, raised in 1799. 

The first island approached on sailing up the loch is Inch-Murrin, 
the most considerable of the group, being a mile and a half long and 
less than half a mile in breadth ; it is thickly wooded, and is employed 
as a deer-park by the Duke of Montrose. At its southern extremity 
is the ruin of a fortalice, which was in former times a residence of

feud are fully narrated. A tradition of the Macgregors admits the slaughter, but 
ascribes it to the unauthorised act of one of their clan.

ISLANDS AND BANKS OF LOCH LOMOND. 63 

the Earls of Lennox, and contiguous to the old castle is situated the 
shooting lod^e of the Duke of Montrose. The small islet next in 
succession is Cre-inch ; Tor-inch lies nearer the right side, opposite 
Buchanan House ; nearer still, is Clair-inch ; next to which is Inch- 
Cailliach (or Caileoch), signifying the Women's (or Old Women's) 
Island, so named, it is said, because a nunnery once existed here. 
In this island the clan Macgregor had a burying-place, where their 
sepulchres are still to be seen. It also contained the Parish Church 
of Buchanan. The steamer, passing through the strait betwixt this 
island and the mainland, touches at Balmaha, the Pass of which 
formerly guarded the entrance to the Highlands from the loch and 
the Lennox. On crossing towards the left side, Eoss-dhu House, the 
seat of Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, presents itself, situated on 
the low promontory from which its name is derived. The ruins ot 
Galbraith Castle are seen on an islet to the north, containing a few 
trees, and named Inch-Galbraith. Inch-Pad, the Long Island, 
succeeds Inch-Cailliach in proceeding upwards; Inch-Moin, the 
Peat Island, towards the left, is but little raised above the surface 
of the water; Inch-Tavannach, or Monk's Island, nearly a mile 
long, is not far distant from the left margin of the lake, between 
Boss-dhu point and the village of Luss ; it is steep and covered with 
copsewood, and the farmer who inhabits it receives as boarders 
persons addicted to intemperance. Inch-Connachan, or Colquhoun's 
Island, lies contiguous and parallel to Inch-Tavannach, from which 
it is separated by a narrow sound. Inch-Cruin, the Round Island, 
is, like Inch- Pad, arable and cultivated. Inch-Lonaig, occupied as 
Sir James Colquhoun's deer-park, is a long low island, covered with 
grass, and remarkable for its old yew trees. The other islands are 
not of sufficient importance to require separate notice.* The steamer 
next proceeds towards Luss. The Free Church is seen opposite the 
lower end of Inch-Tavannach ; at Camstraddan (or Camasstraddan) 
the receding shore forms a bay where the slate is wrought and 
shipped for economical purposes ; and on rounding a headland, the 
village of Luss opens upon the view, delightfully situated in the 
shelter of the wooded hills at the entrance to Glen Luss, through 
which the water of the same name descends to join the lake. Near 
to the landing-place is the Parish Church, encircled by trees, with 
some pretty villas, erected for summer sojourners, interspersed 
amongst the more primitive cottages of the villagers, who, in addition 



* Adders abound in all tlie islands, and are often seen swimming from one 
island to another. 



64 FRANCIS JEFFREY AND LOCH LOMOND. 

to the ordinary avocations of a rural population, enjoy tlie benefits 
arising from the working of the slate quarries in the neighbourhood. 
The heights overlooking Luss afford some of the most commanding 
views of Loch Lomond. The woods abound in oak, ash, yew, holly, 
mountain-ash, birch, hazel, aspen, alder, bird cherry, hawthorn, and 
willow, and everywhere present a luxuriant appearance. The 
parochial charge of Luss is honourably associated with the name of 
Dr. John Stuart, a former incumbent, whose labours in perfecting the 
Gaelic translation of the Holy Scriptures embalm his memory in the 
hearts of the native Highlanders. The steamer now enters the upper 
region of the loch, where it contracts in breadth, and derives a new 
character from its alpine boundaries. At Eowardennan, on the 
opposite shore, those passengers are landed who meditate an ascent of 
Benlomond, at the base of which there is excellent inn accommoda- 
tion, and where guides and ponies are provided. Little more than 
three miles above Luss, on the same side, is Inveruglas, where 
there is a ferry for the conveyance of passengers who may find it 
convenient to reach the base of Benlomond from that direction. 
As the steamer approaches Tarbet, the mansion of Stuckgown 
(John Macmurrich, Esq.) appears on a small terrace amidst the wood 
which here clothes the lower slopes of the hills as they descend to 
the white sandy shore. Stuckgown is about a mile below Tarbet, 
and merits special notice as having been for many years the summer 
retreat of Francis Jeffrey. He was, says his biographer, Lord 
Cockburn, " an idolater of Loch Lomond, and used often to with- 
draw there and refresh himself by its beauties." From the year 1822 
to 1838 it was the annual resort of the great barrister and literary 
critic. He possessed an infallible specific for securing the enjoy- 
ment of the scenery of the loch, which deserves the attention of 
all travellers and sojourners in the western Highlands and Islands, 
where the " skyey influences " but too frequently justify an obser- 
vation applied to our country in general, that we have " no climate 
— only weather." Jeffrey was in the habit of resolutely setting the 
rain at defiance. " Dearly (says his biographer) did he enjoy these 
retirements. He pretended to like even the boating, and delighted 
in mountains, for which one of his habits — an indifference about 
rain — was very convenient." Writing from London in the mid- 
summer of 1831, during the debates on the. Eeform Bill, when he 
was Lord Advocate — "It is very hot (he says), although very 
beautiful, and would be the most delicious weather in the world at 
( Jraigcrook or Loch Lomond, to which last region I wander oftenest 
in my dreams." And in the following year, when his official position 



BEN ARTHUR, OR THE COBBLER. 6i&gt; 

entailed upon him the chief labour of conducting the Scottish 
Eeform Bill through the House of Commons, he wrote about the end 
of June — " I hunger and thirst for another view of Loch Lomond 
and my Highlands." At one time we find him, with his simple 
taste for natural beauty in general, and his genial enthusiasm for the 
scenery of Loch Lomond in particular, rejoicing in "our dear cataracts 
and cliffs," — at another recalling his holiday pursuits as follows : — 
" It rained almost every day while we were in the Highlands, and most 
commonly all day; but the weather never confined either Charlotte or me 
for an hour, and I do not think at all interfered with our enjoyment. It 
was soft, and calm, and balmy; and we walked, and rowed, and climbed, 
and scrambled, without minding the rain any more than the ravens. We 
were out eight or nine hours every day, though wet most of the time, and 
never experienced the least inconvenience or discomfort. The roaring of 
the mountain torrents in a calm morning after a raining night was some- 
thing quite delicious to my ears, and actually makes a kind of music, of which 
you dwellers in the plains can have no conception. From the platform 
before our door, we had twenty at least in sight, and more than a hundred 
within hearing; and the sort of thrilling they made in the air, with the 
mingling of the different waters, on the least swelling of the breeze, had an 
effect quite overpowering and sublime." 

At Tarbet there is a spacious hotel, affording accommodation 
for tourists desirous of prosecuting a leisurely survey of the scenery 
of the loch. Passengers are landed here for Arrochar, at the head 
of Loch Long, separated from Loch Lomond by a narrow neck of 
land, and whence they may be conveyed by steam-boat to Glasgow, 
or by coach to Inverary, by way of Glencroe and " Kest-and-be- 
Thankful." Ben Arthur, or the Cobbler, is ascended from Arrochar, 
where it presents a striking appearance by its bare precipitous flanks, 
crowned by the fantastic peak which bears so remarkable a resem- 
blance to a shoemaker hammering on his lapstone. The mountain 
is 2863 feet high; it is seldom ascended except by the more resolute 
hill-chmbers ; for an equally commanding prospect is obtained from 
the less arduous heights bordering Loch Lomond. Dr. Macculloch, 
who mounted to the summit, and sat astride the cliff " with one 
foot in Loch Long, and the other in Glencroe," says it is worth 
the toil, the ascent to the foot of the fantastic pinnacle not 
being attended by much difficulty. Even at this height, the 
resemblance of the precipice a-top to a cobbler at his work is 
preserved in all its integrity. There the Cobbler " lifts his head to 
the clouds, defying the sun and the storm ; still he hammers at his 
last, unmoved, unchanged, looking down from his proud elevation 
on the transitory sons of little men, reckless as his noted namesake, 



6G UrPER PART OF THE LOCH— ROB ROY'S PRISON. 

of the turmoils and mutations of the world at his feet." Under an 
azure sky and full sunshine, the cliff is described as assuming the 
aspect of " a castle of the gigantic genius of the mountain." So, at 
least, thought an English fellow-countryman whom Macculloch met 
in Glencroe. "Whose castle is that?" he inquired: "the fellow 
must be an arrant fool to build it so high." 

The loch from Tarbet to its upper extremity gradually contracts 
its breadth, the hills rising on either side like lofty walls, and 
throwing their shadows down upon the water, which reflects the 
varying forms of the oak forest fringing the banks. Nearly opposite 
to Tarbet is a cliff named Eob Eoy's Prison, where it is said the 
outlaw was accustomed to let his captives down by a rope, and where 
they were detained to make up their minds as to the ransom to 
be paid for their liberty. This is not to be confounded with Eob 
Eoy's Cave, which, as already indicated, is to be seen amongst the 
crags on the lower slope of the hill less than a mile above Inver- 
snaid. At Upper Inveruglas there is a small island, prettily wooded, 
and containing the ruins of an ancient castellated structure, formerly 
belonging to the Macfarlanes; and two miles nearer the head of the 
loch is another islet named Eilan Yhou, where also there are remains 
of a stronghold of the same clan. A mile and a half from the 
head of the loch, which is seven miles from Tarbet, is pointed out a 
huge fragment of rock, on the road-side, where a sort of " prophet's 
chamber " or pulpit has been excavated, and secured by a door, for 
the use of the minister of Arrochar, who occasionally conducts 
Divine service in this remote district of his parochial charge. At 
Ardlui the steamer lands her passengers, some to be taken up 
by the stage-coaches proceeding to the north, and others to enjoy a 
ramble, for a reasonable time, in Glenfalloch, where some wild and 
picturesque scenery may be traced up the defile for about two miles, 
and from the lower part of which the lake is seen in several striking 
points of view. Behind the inn at Inverarnan a mountain torrent 
produces a fine effect by dashing over a lofty pie sipice; and another 
water-fall in a gorge in the hills opposite, forms a not less striking 
object in front. In a marsh before the inn, at one time, the botanist 
might have picked specimens of Malaxis paludosa; but it has of 
late years disappeared in the progress of draining operations, 
although it will probably be still met with in the ditches and pools 
in the neighbourhood. Glenfalloch abounds in all the varieties of 
oak (Quercus Robur, Q. sessiliflora, Q. intermedia), and the following 
species of bramble occur, viz. Rubus plicatus, suberectus, villicaidis, 
ajjirus, Radula. 



MACCULLCCIl'S ESTIMATE OF LOCH LOMOND. 67 

On tlie return voyage, the reader will not be displeased to peruse 
the following comparative estimate of the scenery of Loch Lomond, 
from the pen of the late Dr. Macculloch : — * 

" Loch Lomond is unquestionably the pride of our lakes ; incomparable 
in its beauty as in its dimensions, exceeding all others in variety as it does 
in extent and splendour, and uniting in itself every style of scenery which 
is found in the other lakes of the Highlands. I must even assign it the 
palm above Loch Cateran (Katrine\ the only one which is much distin- 
guished from it in character, the only one to which it does not contain an 
exact parallel in the style of its landscapes. With all its strange and 
splendid beauties, it is a property of Loch Cateran to weary and fatigue 
the eye; dazzling by the style and multiplicity of its ornaments, and rather 
misleading the judgment on a first inspection, than continuing to satisfy 
it after long familiarity. It must be remembered too, that, splendid and 
grand as are the landscapes of this lake, and various as they may appear 
from their excess and boldness of ornament, there is an uniformity, even 
in that variety, and that a sameness of character predominates everywhere. 
It possesses but one style; and numerous as its pictures are, they are 
always constructed, from the same exact elements, and these frequently 
but slight modifications of each other. 

" As with regard to the superiority of Loch Lomond to all the other 
lakes, there can be no question, so, in the highly contrasted character of 
its upper and lower portions, it offers points of comparison with the whole; 
with all those at least which possess any picturesque beauty ; for it has 
no blank. It presents nowhere that poverty of aspect which, even at Loch 
Cateran, marks nearly three-fourths of the lake. Everywhere it is in 
some way picturesque; and everywhere it offers landscapes not merely to 
the cursory spectator, but to the painter. Nor do I think that I over-rate 
its richness in scenery, when I say, that if Loch Cateran and Loch Achray 
are omitted, it presents, numerically, more pictures than all the lakes of 
the Highlands united. With respect to style, from its upper extremity to 
a point above Luss, it may be compared with the finest views of Loch Awe, 
on Loch Lubnaig, on Loch Maree, and on Loch Earn ; since no others can 
here pretend to enter into competition with it. There are also points in this 
division not dissimilar to the finer parts of the Trosachs, and fully equal to 
them in wild grandeur. At the lower extremity, it may compete with the 
lakes of a middle character, such as Loch Tummel ; excelling them all, 
however, as well in variety as in extent. But it possesses, moreover, a 

* " The Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland," described in " Letters to 
Sir Walter Scott," by John Macculloch, M. D., F.R.S., G.S., &amp;c, 1824. The 
author was the first to make a geological survey of the Western Islands, which is 
the subject of a separate and elaborate work. The Letters to Scott, frequently 
quoted in the different parts of this publication, abound in graphic and discrimin- 
ating descriptions of Highland scenery, which the author had opportunities of 
exploring and studying for ten successive years. It is to be regretted that the 
work is often deformed by flippant pedantry and undisguised prejudice against 
the Highlanders. 



08 PARTING VIEW OF LOCH LOMOND. 

style of landscape to which Scotland produces no resemblance whatever, 
since Loch Maree scarcely offers an exception. This is found in the 
numerous and varied islands that cover its noble expanse; forming the 
feature which, above all others, distinguishes Loch Lomond, and which, 
oven had it no other attractions, would render it, what it is in every 
respect, the paragon of the Scottish lakes." 

If the view of Loch Lomond is striking, when it first unfolds its 
broad expanse of clear water, its lovely islands, verdant meadows, 
variegated woods, and, beyond, Benlomond rearing its noble brow 
to the clouds, and the lake retiring in the distance into the gorge of 
the dusky hills, — the last view, on a calm summer evening, when 
the sun is pouring his yellow lustre on mountain and loch and tree 
and tower, is one which will linger fondly in the memory. Such a 
scene is finely pourtrayed by the author above-quoted : — 

"When the sun sets in this delicious landscape, crimsoning the lofty 
summit of Benlomond, throwing its yellow light on the glassy water, and 
gilding every woody island, every grey rock, and every tree, with its 
parting rays, while the evening smoke is seen curling blue under the shade 
of the wooded hills, and the voice of the shepherd's boy and the lowing of 
cattle is heard breaking on the universal silence, then it is that Loch 
Lomond is seen and felt as it deserves, — then alone is it appreciated. But 
thus will it be known only to the solitary traveller. There is a soul in the 
scene, a spirit in its whispering woods and tinkling waves, and airy hills, 
that shuns society." 

From Balloch the passengers on landing from the loch are conveyed 
by train to Stirling or to Glasgow, arriving in the latter city in time 
for the train to Edinburgh. In descending the vale of Leven water, 
from Balloch, the manufacturing village of Alexandria is passed with 
Bonhill on the opposite side of the stream. The next village is 
Eenton, where a glimpse may be obtained, in passing, of the top of 
the monument to Tobias George Smollett, the historian and novelist, 
a native of the vale whose pastoral charms and pure gliding waters 
now exist only in his immortal verse. Smollett was born at 
Dalquhurn, near to where the village is now situated, and which 
derived its name from a Miss Eenton, who became the wife of 
Mr. Telfer, nephew of Smollett ; a sister of this lady's, Miss Eleanora 
Eenton, is celebrated for her elegant person in the author's novel of 
" Humphrey Clinker," under the initials of E. E., and who became 
Mrs. Sharpe of Hoddam. At Dumbarton, the attention of the 
stranger will be attracted by the old Castle, solitary and stern, and 
fraught with many historical memories, which cannot be touched 
here, however briefly. For some distance, the railway now runs 
parallel with the river Clyde. On the wooded promontory of 



QUADRUPEDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 69 

Dunglass, overlooking the river, is the monument to Henry Bell, 
the first successful applier of steam to the purposes of navigation in 
Europe, and whose first steam-boat, the Comet, was launched upon 
the Clyde in 1812. Dunglass was the western extremity of the 
Roman Wall (p. 7), which is supposed either to have been carried 
from this promontory up the face of the adjacent hill, or, which is 
more probable, to have commenced on the elevated ridge, whence 
the remains both of the wall and ditch are distinctly traceable for 
several miles to the eastward. The monument to Robert Walter, 
eleventh Lord Blantyre, who was accidentally killed at Brussels, 
during the revolution, in 1830, is seen on the further side of the 
river, rising above the woods and lawns of Erskine. At Bowling 
bay and village (where passengers land from the Clyde for Loch 
Lomond) is the western extremity of the canal which unites the 
Erith of Eorth with the Clyde. Thence, after pausing at Maryhill, 
the train proceeds to Glasgow. 



ZOOLOGY OE THE BANKS OE LOCH LOMOND AND 
ITS VICINITY. 

[For the following notices the writer has much pleasure in acknowledging 
his obligations to Robert. Gray, Esq., the excellent Secretary to the 
Glasgow Natural History Society.] 

r.— QUADRUPEDS FREQUENTING THE BANKS OF LOCH 
LOMOND AND ITS VICINITY. 

The Badger (Meles TaxusJ. Fleming. This ancient member of the planti- 
grade family is still found in most districts bordering on the loch. I have 
seen of late two very fine specimens distinguished for great size and the 
perfection of their fur. 

The Otter (Ltitra vulgaris), is also met with along the banks in suitable 
localities, and on one of the islands — Inch Oonachan. 

The Ermine (Mustela ErmineaJ. Not uncommon. Is found in winter in 
the low grounds, preying on game and small birds, &amp;c; but in the summer 
season it frequents the tops of the hills, being sometimes met with at an 
elevation of 1500 feet. 

The Polecat or Foumart (Mustela Putorius), frequents the glens in rocky 
and retired places, and prowls at night in the neighbourhood of farms and 
dwelling-houses, preying upon eggs and poultry, in pursuit of which it displays 
great cunning. 

The Marten (MartesfoinaJ, and 

The Pine Marten (Martes abietum), are both known to frequent the 
woods, though not common. 

Wild Cat (Felis CatusJ. This undoubted species has been repeatedly 
trapped in the immediate vicinity of the loch. In general aspect, form, and 
colouring, all the specimens I have examined resemble each other very closely. 

i 



ft) BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 

The male exceeds the female in size, sometimes measuring nearly four feet in 
length. A tine pair are in the collection of Sir James Colquhoun, Bart. ; they 
were killed in the Eoss-dhu woods, where they had for some time committed 
destination amongst the game. The keeper, Mr. M'Donald, informed me that 
t hose animals have a truly ferocious look when trapped, and that no one seeing 
them in a state of nature can ever suppose they are in anyway connected with 
our domestic species. They prey upon hares and game birds. The wild cat 
is also met with on that side of the loch which belongs to the Duke of 
Montrose, who has presented one or two fine specimens to the College 
Museum at Glasgow. 

The Fox (Vulpes vulgaris). The small variety finds shelter and abundance 
of prey in various places along the banks. 

The Common Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), is very abundant in the woods 
upon Sir James Colquhoun's estate. Last year they were found to be commit- 
ting so much mischief among the larches by nipping the tops that orders were 
given to destroy them. Many hundreds were killed ; but the district through- 
out is so favourable to the habits of the squirrel that it will soon again increase. 
It is somewhat curious that there are no squirrels in Ayrshire. 

The Black Bat (Mus Rattus), was killed a few weeks ago at Shemore farm. 

The Alpine Hare (Lepus variabilis). On Benlomond, and on Shemore 
hill, where last shooting season my friend Mr. A. M'Mven and party killed 
thirty-four the first day. It is becoming very plentiful on the entire range of 
the Loch Lomond hills. 

The Bed Deer (Cervus Elaphus), appears occasionally on Benlomond. 

The Boe Deer (Cervus capreolus), is abundant in young woods and 
plantations in several of the islands of Loch Lomond, which they reach 
by swimming. When pursued on their limited territory, they at once plunge 
into the loch and seek refuge on the mainland. I examined recently a 
beautiful albino of this elegant species which was caught near Luss. It is 
perfectly white, and for some time the keeper had observed it as a con- 
spicuous object on the mountain-side. It perished in rough weather, and 
now graces the collection of Sir James Colquhoun. 



II.— THE BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 
[There are few districts in Scotland offering a better field of observation to 
the ornithologist than the shores and islands of this magnificent lake. 
During summer these are frequented by multitudes of sea gulls and wading 
birds, which retire after the breeding season, and give place to others not 
less interesting— marine ducks, swans, and wild geese; thus preserving, 
though in the midst of mountain scenery, the attractions of sea and land, 
without the perils which are sometimes associated with the rambles of an 
anxious bird-hunter. It is in such a district only that the lover of birds can 
acquaint himself, from a single point of observation, with species whose usual 
haunts are widely remote ; for while he sees the eagle and peregrine sweep- 
ing along the mountain side, and discerns on its summit the startled 
ptarmigan, he may listen at the same moment to the hoarse shout of the 
great sea gull, or the plaintive cries of the sandpipers as they rise from the 
island marsh or the pebbled shore. At other times, when the surface of the 
loch is ruffled, and the small angry waves dash upon the island borders, the 
discomfort of exposure is well repaid by the sight of many a wild wanderer 
who&amp;e presence forms an agreeable feature in what would otherwise be a cold

picture to look upon. Strings of wild dwk, among which the dunbird and 
golden-eye are conspicuous ; groups of mergansers gathered by some common 
instinct into the sheltered bays ; grebes and divers ; the bean goose, bernicle, 
and the stately swan, — all contribute to the impression that Scotland is still 
the stronghold for many of the feathered tribes whose habits and history 
form no unimportant element in the studies of a British Ornithologist. The 
following list includes only those species which are considered worthy of 
remark in connection with the locality. — E. G.] 

RAPTORES. FALCONIBM. 



The Golden Eagle (Aquila Chrysa'e 
Is occasionally seen in the neighbourhood of the loch; sometimes a pair, 
but usually single birds, probably from a distance. There is still, however, 
one eyrie at least, not many miles from Benlomond. In April of this year 
(1863), a golden eagle was seen at intervals hunting over the high grounds 
between Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, and a pair frequented Loch Sloy, 
near Ben Vean, throughout last winter. I have good authority for saying 
that another pair bred last year at the Braes at Balquhidder. 

The White-tailed Sea Eagle (Haliceetus albicilla). 
Dr. Dewar, whose collection of Scottish birds of prey is of unusual interest, 
shot a specimen of this eagle behind Benlomond, and he has also observed it 
on Loch Lomond side, where it appears at irregular intervals; it is, however, 
still abundant in some of the western islands. 

The Osprey or Fishing Hawk (Pandion Haliceetus) 
Formerly had its eyrie on Inch-Galbraith, but for many years it has only 
appeared as a rare straggler. One was seen two years ago in the vicinity of 
Inch-Moin. It has likewise disappeared from Lake Menteith and Loch Awe, 
none having bred in these localities for eight or ten years. 

The Peregrine Falcon (Falco Peregrinus). 
There are many breeding stations of this fine species on Loch Lomond side. 
Between Loch Long and Loch Katrine, Dr. Dewar of Glasgow has collected 
upwards of a dozen young falcons during the course of a single season. 

The Merlin (Falco cesalori) 
Breeds on most of the surrounding hills, and, in some places, at a consider- 
able elevation. This interesting falcon is common throughout the western 
counties of Scotland. I have had a number of eggs and birds sent to me from 
the Hebrides and various parts of Argyleshire, where they are by no means 
difficult to procure. 

The Kestrel or Windhover (Falco Tinnunculus) 
Is very numerous on some of the islands. Inch-Tavannach, in particular, is a 
favourite resort, where they associate with jackdaws occupying the rocky 
cliffs fronting Luss. On these ivy-covered shelves they breed in considerable 
numbers; and, even with so many families to rear, they are quite harmless. 

The Kite (Milvus vulgaris). 
Although still met with in some of the western counties as a straggler, this 
handsome bird as a resident has disappeared from Loch Lomond side. A 
solitary specimen may pass an hour or two sweeping high in air above the old 
haunts, but, with an instinctive dread of danger, these visitants seldom, if

evfir, alight. Dr. Dewar found a kite's nest with eggs near Bonaw in 1858. 
At Kenmore wood, near Tarbet, a pair bred some years ago ; the nest is still 
there; and Dr. Dewar informs me that on inspection he found among the 
materials a pair of ragged old trousers, a pair of stockings, and sundry other 
articles which the birds had used in building. 

The Common Buzzard (Buteo vulgaris) 
Breeds in different localities, and is not uncommon; very variable in its 
plumage; the eggs are also subject to great variety. 

The Hen Harrier (Circus cyaneus) 
Frequents the high grounds in summer; breeds on Shemore hill and elsewhere. 
Di. Dewar found, on one occasion, a nest of this species containing nine eggs, 
the usual number being six. But in this instance there may have been two 
pairs of harriers using the nest — a circumstance of not unfrequent occurrence 
with other birds. 

STBIGIDM. 

The Long-Eared Owl (Otus vulgaris). 
Not unfrequent in the woods bordering the loch. 

The Short-Eared Owl (Otus brachyotos) 
Has been found on some of the islands, but is not known to breed in these 
haunts or on the neighbouring mountains. 

The White or Barn Owl (Strixflammea), 
A beautiful object when seen at the gloaming, flying alongside the deep green 
woods. It frequents Inch-Tavannach, nestling on the ledges of rock at a 
moderate height beside the kestrels and jackdaws. Its nest has also been 
found on the precipitous side of a deep gorge in Shemore glen, near a series 
of waterfalls, the owners living in constant gloom amid the noise and spray. 
In various other places near the loch it makes choice of similar situations. 

The Tawny Owl (Syrnium stridula). 
Not uncommon; very variable in plumage. Its whereabouts maybe ascer- 
tained after nightfall by the alarm and noise not unfrequently occasioned 
when it intrudes upon a sleeping colony of birds. 

INSESSORES. MTJ8CICAPIBM 

DENTIROSTRES. M ^LICAFIDJ!,. 

The Spotted Flycatcher (Muscicapa grisola), 
A quiet inhabitant of the outskirts of woods, and the vicinity of farm 
steadings. I have seen it cover the exterior of its nest, when in exposed 
situations, with black sheep's wool so as to harmonize with the dark trunk of 
an elm on which it was placed. This bird feeds its young late in the evening 
with the large-bodied moths which it cleverly seizes lengthwise and drops the 
wings which are cut off with the edges of its mandibles. 

MEETJLIBM. 
The Common Dipper (Cinclus aquations) 
Is found on all the banks of the loch and frequents every stream running 
into it. It breeds commonly near or under a waterfall, but occasionally 
in holes of decayed trees. The nest is of great bulk, and skilfully fastened to 
whatever it is built upon, even though, as is often the case, it should be 



BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 73 

placed on a wet wall of rock. I have never yet seen a nest swept away or 
injured, although I have found numbers in seemingly dangerous situations. 
In places where the roads skirt the loch, the tourist may see dippers sitting 
frequently by the water's edge on a little stone, wheeling often round on their 
perch and curtseying to him as he passes.* 

The Ring Ouzel (Turdus torquatus). 
Plentiful on Benlomond, on Shemore hill, and on all the hill sides, where it 
breeds. 

SYLVIABM. 

The Redstart (Phcenicura ruticilla). 
Chiefly found near the public roads. It nestles in the rough stone dykes, 
and is not uncommon. 

The Stonechat (Saxicola rubicola) 
Is found on one of the islands — Inch-Moin — and breeds there. 

The Whin-chat (Saxicola rubetra) 
Is also found on the same island. 

The Wheatear (Saxicola amanthe) 
On the surrounding mountain ranges, breeding at a considerable height. 
The nest is usually found in turf dykes. The bird, however, is not in any great 
numbers 

INSESSOBES. 

DENTIROSTRES. 

The Grasshopper Warbler (Salicaria locustella). 
This very curious bird has been obtained oftener than once on Loch Lomond 
side, where it is known to breed. The young on being disturbed quit the nest 
though but half-fledged, trusting to their instinctive power of concealment. 
I have stood on a braeface where I knew a brood was dispersed, and on all 
sides the chirp was heard; but it was not until I had spent nearly an hour in 
perplexing search that I was rewarded by the capture of one of the crickets : 
it was not many days old. 

The Sedge Warbler (Salicaria phragmitis), 
A babbling and diverting species, common in suitable places near the edge 
of the loch. The nest is oblong and very deep : eggs six in number. A capital 
mimic, hurrying over many droll imitations of the notes of other birds with 
amusing vivacity. Its performances, however, are in a measure thrown away 
in its favourite resorts, which, in the district we now write about, are far 
removed from cot or shieling. 

The Black-Cap Warbler (Curruca atricapilla) 
Sometimes seen in the hedgerows, but is by no means common. 

The Lesser Whitethroat (Curruca sylviella) 
Not common, but less obtrusive than the preceding, frequenting places not so 
much exposed. 

* The lively and familiar water crow was lately seen on the Kelvin, near Particle; buthe looked 
sadly out of his element. Near him there flirted and chirruped a pair of yellow wagtails, the trio, 
once the appropriate bird life of a lovely grove, now a mockery in the impure waters. A. yeai or 
two more and the naturalist, in expecting to find dippers on the Kelvin, may as well look for the 
beauties of Milton in a catalogue of household furniture. 



74 BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 

The Wood Warbler (Sylvia sylvicola). 
Not rare; shy and unobtrusive among the trees. Breeds at the edges of 
woods, generally near the public road. 

The Willow Warbler (Sylvia trochilus). 
Extremely common, appearing towards the end of April. 

The Chiff Chaff (Sylvia rufa) 
In the plantations near cultivated places. 

The Golden-Crested Regulus (Regulus cristatus). 
Very abundant. The males may be seen quietly perched on the fir trees singing 
their faint melodies. In autumn great numbers flock together, dispersing 
themselves through a wood and diligently searching among the branches for 
insect prey. Is easily tamed, but soon dies in confinement. 



The Ruby-Crowned Regulus (Regulus Calendula). 
This North American species has occurred near Tarbet, Dr. Dewar having 
shot a specimen there in 1854, as recorded in the proceedings of the Natural 
History Society of Glasgow. It had not previously been noticed in Europe. 

PARIDM. 

The Cole Tit (Parus ater). 
Very common, especially in winter, when it frequents the public roads: a 
beautiful species. 

The Long-Tailed Tit (Parus caudatus) 
Occurs in restless flocks in winter; and breeds in all the surrounding woods. 
I have seen hundreds in the hedgerows near Luss, travelling by short flights. 

MOTACILLIBM. 
The Pied Wagtail (Motacilla Tarrellii) 
Assembles in autumnal flocks near marshy places, and on the Leven connecting 
the loch with the river Clyde. These join the migratory flocks, consisting of 
many hundreds gathered from the upland districts, which travel by easy stages 
following the course of the river to the sea. Great numbers may be seen in 
August and September running upon the timber rafts on the Clyde in its most 
bustling quarter — Glasgow Harbour. 

The Grey Wagtail (Motacilla boarula). 
This elegant wagtail is a native of the district and is permanently resident. 
A bird of lively habits, and partial to clear and shallow streams. In autumn, 
as with the preceding species, the young birds run after their parents for some 
time after they are fledged. 

Ray's Wagtail (Budytes Rayi). 
Is not common — a pair occurring in places suited to its habits, at intervals of 
some miles along the side of the loch. 

ANTHIDM. 

The Tree Pipit (Anthus arboreus). 
Tolerably common in patches of plantation. This bird is abundant near 
Glasgow. 



BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 75 

The Meadow Pipit (Anthus pratensis). 
Very common on the mountains where it breeds, often near the summit. 

INSES SORES. FWmFKT7TT)X&lt; 

CONIROSTEES. EMBERIZID2E. 

The Snow Bunting (Plectrophanes nivalis). 
Very common on the higher mountain ranges, but in severe weather it 
descends to the low grounds. It is seen sometimes in great flocks. 



The Common Bunting (Emberiza Miliaria). 
Of occasional occurrence only, though abundant in some districts in the West 
of Scotland. 

The Black-Headed Bunting (Emberiza Schoeniculus). 
Very common at the old Fruin, where, in spring time, 30 or 40 may be seen 
on the willows within a compass of a few yards. 

ERINGILLIBM. 

The Goldfinch (Carduelis elegans) 
Is observed in limited numbers in cultivated places. 

The Siskin (Carduelis spinus) 
Also occurs in small flocks, and is occasionally seen in summer. 

The Lesser Eedpole (Linota Linaria). 
Sparingly distributed, and breeds in various localities. 

The Twite (Linota montium). 
Not numerous, but most people are familiar with the "heather lintie." 

The Bullfinch (Pyrrhula vulgaris). 
In some numbers, frequenting plantations and woods near the public roads. 

The Common Crossbill (Loxia curvirostra). 
A regular visitant, but not in considerable numbers, except in severe winters 
when the flocks are very large. 

STURNIDJE. 

The Common Starling (Sturnus vulgaris). 
Abundant; greatly on the increase within the last ten years, and destructive 
to other birds such as build upon the ground. It devours the eggs of the 
common lark, for which it deliberately searches ; and in some localities this 
favourite songster has materially diminished in numbers owing to the rapacity 
of the starling. 

CORVID^J. 
The Raven (Corvus corax). 
Very common, on the hill sides and on the islands. It may be seen daily, 
sometimes soaring at a great height, on which occasions it is easily known by 
its hoarse bark : it breeds in several places in the vicinity of the loch. 

The Carrion Crow (Corvus corone) 
Common, as is 



76 BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 

The Hooded Crow (Corvus comix). 
Both species breed promiscuously, and persons resident near their haunts are 
well aware that these two birds occupy the same nest — the brood in every case 
being half the number grey backed, and the other half entirely black. Only 
one species is recognised, the hoodie, as it is called, the male bird being black 
and the female grey. There is scarcely in the district a nest forming an 
exception to this rule. 

The Jackdaw (Corvus monedula). 
Extremely numerous. 

The Magpie (Pica caudata). 
Very common. Sometimes associates in companies, making a chattering noise 
and roosting together on one tree. 

The Jay (Garrulus glandarius). 
Numerous in plantations — a very noisy bird, and of a questionable reputation. 

INSES SORES. n-vvmrr at, 

SCANSOBES. LERTHIADM. 

The Common Creeper (Certhia familiaris). 
Very common. 

CTJCJJLIDM. 

The Common Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). 
Very abundant in the neighbouring glens, and on the hill sides. I have counted 
nearly a dozen in sight at once. It lays its eggs on some of the islands where 
half-fledged young are often found. 

INSES SORES. _ . _ „™ ATTT , „ 

FISSIROSTHES. HALCYONID2E. 

The Kingfisher (Alcedo Ispida). 
A well-known species in the district, but seldom obtained. 

HIRUNDINIDJS. 

The Sand Martin (Hirundo mparia). 
A large colony of sand martins breed in the face of a cliff above Shemore 
Glen. Their nests are lined, as in the case of the willow warbler breeding on 
the grassy slopes of the same cliff, with the feathers of grouse, black game, 
and pheasants. 

CAPRIMULGIDM 

The Nightjar (Caprimulgus Europceus) 
Is not uncommon. It breeds among the heather on both sides of the loch, 
preferring patches on which ferns are growing; hence its name of " fern owl." 

RA SORES. COL VMBIBM. 

The Turtle Dove (Columba Turtur) 
Has been shot at Eoss-dhu. A fine specimen is in the collection of Sir James 
Colquhoun, Bart. 

FETRAONIDM 
The Black Grouse (Tetrao tetrix). 
Extremely common. Hundreds may be counted in a morning feeding on the 
grain when in stook. Breeds at a moderate elevation on all the hills. 



BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 77 

The Eed Grouse (Lagopus scoticus). 
In great abundance. 

The Ptarmigan (Lagopus vulgaris). 
Very common on the high ranges of mountain. Difficult to distinguish from 
the ground on which it squats in fear when approached. It also frequents 
Shemore hill. 

GRALLATORES. CHARABRIBM. 

The Golden Plover (Charadrius pluvialis) 
Breeds on Shemore hill, and on most of the mountain ranges on both sides of 
the loch. 

The Ringed Plover (Charadrius hiaticula). 
I have observed this pretty plover breeding on all the shores of the loch and 
on some of the islands. The young are carefully watched by the parent birds, 
and crouch instinctively, remaining quiet when their haunts are invaded. 
They run about as soon as hatched, being no bigger than a small walnut, and 
invariably, under a sense of danger, He down with their heads to windward, 
looking as smooth as a polished stone, for which they are readily mistaken. 
The old ones, while frequenting the beaches, linger only upon the stony places, 
and run hurriedly across any green patches of grass when shifting from place 
to place, thus screening themselves from observation. 

The Sanderling (Calidris arenaria). 
Single birds seen occasionally on the banks as late as June. 

The Lapwing (Vanellus Cristatus). 
Abundant, breeding in grass parks verging on the loch. Assembles in immense 
flocks at the end of the season on the sandy shores of Inch-Moin. 

The Turnstone (Strepsilas Interpres) 
Has been shot on the banks. 

The Oyster Catcher (Hcematopus Ostralegus). 
A few pairs breed on the shores, but it is by no means numerous. I have seen 
it in summer on Inch-Moin. 

ARDEIDM. 

The Common Heron (Ardea Cinerea). 
There is a small heronry on one of the islands. When fledged the young birds 
remain in company, and about nightfall fly together to their fishing grounds. 



SCOLOPACID&amp;. 

The Common Curlew (Numenius a/r quota). 
Abundant, breeding on the hills around. It also breeds upon Inch-Moin. 



The Common Redshank (Totanus CaUdris). 
Very common on the shore at Mid-Ross. It breeds there on the shingle, but 
the eggs are not easily found, from their resemblance to the stones among 
which they are laid. 

K 



78 BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 

The Common Sandpiper (Totanus hypoleucos). 
A very common summer visitant; it breeds in great numbers along the banks 
of the loch, the nests being placed just on the line of high water mark. 
I have seen about twenty nests during the course of a ramble. The nests 
are also found in grass fields adjoining the loch, placed generally beside a 
tuft of plants ; and on some of the islands, especially Inch-Moin, where I have 
found the nest under shelter of stunted whin bushes. 

The Greenshank (Totanus glottis). 
An occasional straggler is shot, but it does not appear in summer, although 
there are breeding stations not far distant from Loch Lomond. 

The Woodcock (Scolopax rusticola) 
Breeds in some numbers every summer in different localities near the loch ; 
it also breeds on one or two of the islands. 

The Common Snipe (Scolopax gallinago) 
Breeds on Inch-Moin, and on most of the marshy spots on the neighbouring 
hills. 

The Jack Snipe (Scolopax gallinula). 
Found sparingly in winter. 

The Dunlin (Tringa variabilis). 
I have observed dunlins at midsummer on Inch-Moin, where it probably 
breeds. Mr. M'Donald, gamekeeper to Sir James Colquhoun, Bart., has 



RALLIDM. 

The Water Rail (Rallus aquaticus). 
Not often observed, from its habits of skulking. A timid bird when at liberty, 
but easily tamed and kept in confinement. 

The Moor Hen (Gallinula C'hloropus) 
Frequents all the islands. 



LOBIPEDIDM. 



The Common Coot (Fulica atra). 
Less common than the preceding. 



KA TA TORES. ANATIDM. 

The Bean Goose (Anser segetum) 
Occurs in flocks on the loch every winter. 

The Bernicle Goose (Anser leucopsis). 
Not so numerous as the preceding species. Occurs at the same season. 

The Brent Goose (Anser torquatus) 
Has been shot on the loch. 

The Egyptian Goose (Anser Egyptiacus). 
A flock of five, three of which were shot, occurred on Loch Lomond in 1861. 
One of the specimens was exhibited at a meeting of the Natural History 
Society of Glasgow by Dr. Dewar. 



BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. t 9 

The Canada Goose (Anser Canadensis). 
A single specimen was shot on Loch Lomond some years ago, and is now in 
the College Museum, Glasgow.* 

The Hooper or Whistling Swan (Cygnus ferns'). 
Winter flocks are observed almost every year. 

Bewick's Swan (Cygnus Bewickii). 
rTot uncommon. Eeadily distinguished, even at a distance, by its smaller 
size. Is occasionally shot. A fine specimen, obtained a few years ago, is in 
the Collection at Eoss-dhu. 

The Wild Duck (Anas Boschas). 
Extremely common. Bree is upon Inch-Moin. The nests are placed on dry 
grassy tufts, sometimes under shelter of a thick bush of heath. When the 
young are hatched they are led by the old birds to the nearest pools near the 
edges of which they lie crowded in a body. On being disturbed they plunge 
at once into the water, which, from the peaty nature of the soil, is very dark 
in colour; and there they are safe, as they rise near the edge, thrusting their 
nostrils just above water among the herbage, a position which almost defies 
discovery. I have found young broods as early as April. 

The Teal (Anas Crecca). 
Very numerous, breeding upon Inch-Moin and in other localities. The nest 
is placed in spots similar to those occupied by the mallard. In winter the 
broods collect into large flocks, remaining upon Inch-Moin. 

The Pochard or Dun Bird (Fuligula ferina). 
The most abundant species on the loch, congregating in great flocks during 
winter. 

The Scaup Duck (Fuligula marila), 
In limited numbers, mixing with the foregoing species. 

The Tufted Duck (Fuligula Cristata). 
Not uncommon in winter in company with other diving ducks, feeding upon 
grasses, &amp;c, which they obtain in shallow water. 

The Golden Eye (Fuligula Clangula). 
Common, especially young birds (morillons) which are distributed over the 
loch in winter. 

The Smew (Mergus albellus). 
A pair was seen on the loch some years ago ; the male was shot, and is now 
in the collection of Sir James Colquhoun, Bart. 

The Eed Breasted Merganser (Mergus serrator) 
Breeds regularly in some numbers on the islands and round the shores of 
the loch. I have approached, under shelter of the brushwood, within eight 
or ten yards of these beautiful birds in pairs, at the commencement of the 
breeding season; and I have frequently found their nests, which are bulky 
and filled with feathers, under the shelter of whin bushes and tufts of coarse

heather. The eggs are usually niue in number. Towards autumn the young 
broods collect into groups numbering as many as fifty birds, frequenting 
shallow bays, where they appear to be presided over by at most one or two 
old birds. This habit is very noticeable. 

The Goosander (Mergus Merganser). 
Not numerous ; nor have I heard of its nest being found in any part of the 
district. 

COLYMBID2E. 

The Sclavonian Grebe (Podiceps Comutus) 
Has been shot on Loch Lomond. 

The Little Grebe (Podiceps minor) 
Is common. 

The Great Northern Diver (Colymbus glacialis) 
Makes its appearance regularly on Loch Long, at Arrochar, within two miles 
of Loch Lomond; it leaves at nightfall, however, returning to the open sea. 

The Black-Throated Diver (Colymbus arcticus) 
Has been procured, both in summer and winter plumage, on the loch. This 
very beautiful bird has been found breeding in three different localities near 
Oban by Dr. Dewar, who exhibited bird and eggs at a meeting of the Natural 
History Society of Glasgow. 

The Eed-Throated Diver (Colymbus Seplentrionalis). 
Common. 

PELECANID^J. 

The Common Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo") 
Occasionally seeks a change from salt water by visiting the loch. A pair has 
been observed every summer frequenting a rock in the vicinity of Eob Eoy's 
Cave. 

The Gannet (Sula bassana) 
In the course of its erratic nights appears in some numbers on Loch Long, at 
Arrochar. 

LAUIDM. 

The Sandwich Tern (Sterna Boysii). 
This tern has of late years bred upon the island of Inch-Moin. There are 
about a dozen pairs. Such a situation is not usual, but they will probably 
increase if unmolested. 

The Roseate Tern (Sterna Dongallii). 
A few pairs breed upon Inch-Moin. This elegant species has entirely dis- 
appeared from the Cumbraes where it was originally discovered.* 



* Ornithologists will be gratified to learn that the proprietor of this island, so often quoted, 
permits no intrusion on the haunts of the birds, the ground being strictly preserved. Were other 
proprietors to exercise the same precautions we should have fewer regrets about the disappearance 
of our native birds. Naturalists themselves are not free of responsibility; for by paying freely 
rices for the rarer birds of this country, they offer inducement to dealers, who commit 
ravages, with no other object than that of turning tbeir plunder into money. Let 110 sucb 
collector visit Inch-Moin. 



BIRDS OF LOCH LOMOND. 81 

The Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) 
Also breeds upon Inch-Moin in limited numbers. The nests are placed among 
the shingle at one or two projecting points, and all the terns found on the 
island breed in company. The young are fed with marine fishes brought by 
the parent birds across the mountains from the Frith of Clyde. I have often 
watched their arrival, and observed the fish to be held by the middle of the 
body.- they were chiefly sand-eels and young herrings. 

The Lesser Tern (Sterna minuta") 
Occurs in summer upon Inch-Moin in company with the other species, breeding 
on the same station. It is, however, not numerous. 

Bonaparte's Gull (Larus Bonapartti) 
Was shot on Loch Lomond in 1851, as recorded in the " Zoologist." 



The Little Gull (Larus minutus). 
I observed a single specimen of this beautiful little gull two years ago; it 
followed our boat on the loch a considerable distance, in company with a 
number of black-headed and lesser black-backed gulls, which had been allured 
by a quantity of bait thrown out. As the bird approached within a few feet 
of the boat it was recognised without difficulty. 



The Black-Headed Gull (Larus ridibundus). 
Abundant. Between five and six hundred pairs breed every year upon the 
island of Inch-Moin, the central parts of which are covered with nests. In 
wet seasons, when the birds are numerous, a great many pairs make their 
nests on the shingle near the edge of the loch, the middle of the island being 
under water. There is immense variation in the colouring of the eggs. Some- 
times in one nest I have found half the number of eggs pale blue without any 
spots, the other half being of a deep umber brown, as if all the colouring 
matter had been distributed on the two first laid. The nests are bulky, and 
raised about six inches, to keep the birds off the wet surface or out of danger 
in case of floods. It is curious to observe that many of the young ones when 
newly hatched are spotted exactly like the shells. They take to the water 
almost immediately; and when about three days old they voluntarily leave 
the nest, crowding together in the vicinity of the pools into which they paddle 
on the approach of any one landing on their territories. Second year's birds 
are seen in some numbers ; they have a black head and a black band across 
the tip of the tail, and are generally to be found at a distance from the breeding 
station perpetually on wing and hovering above some shallow bank, on the 
watch for the gliding fishes, as if feeding were their sole business. 



The Lesser Black-Backed Gull (Larus fuscus). 
About a hundred and fifty pairs breed on Inch-Moin, and its numbers appear 
to be on the increase. The nest is bulky, formed of moss and grass, and is 
generally under the shelter of a thick bush of heather with a pathway leading 
to it. The bird lays three eggs, which are very variable in form and colouring. 
During the daytime, before the eggs are all laid, these gulls congregate in a 
flock and rest upon the water close to the island for hours at a time. They 
occupy a part of the island by themselves, and do not mix, while incubating, 
with the smaller gulls. 



82 FISHES OF LOCH LOMOND. 

The Great Black-Backed Gull (Lams marinus). 
Twelve or fourteen pairs annually resort to Inch-Moin and breed upon the 
island. The nests are very similar to those of the lesser black-back; the eggs 
three in number, and also variable in their markings. 

This species is very conspicuous about nightfall, when returning from the 
hills, following the course of some glen. It flaps lazily past on calm nights, 
or sails with unbroken sweep in rough weather, uttering an occasional hoarse 
cry. Its bulky figure and ample wings, when contrasted with the green 
foliage of the glens, give the bird an imposing appearance. 

Farmers complain of the great black-backed gull as being destructive to 
young lambs, especially such as are sickly at birth — an accusation supported 
by ample proof during the breeding time, the young at that season being 
provided with a selection of food not obtainable in their legitimate hunting 
grounds. 

This concludes our catalogue of the Birds of Loch Lomond. The list may 
not appear extensive when compared with that of other districts in Scotland 
occupying a smaller area; but it has been the writer's wish to avoid all 
doubtful species, and record only what has fallen under his own observation. 
or can be substantiated by his personal friends. It is hoped, however, that 
both list and remarks, imperfect though they must necessarily be, will be 
acceptable as a contribution to the ornithology of Scotland, and as a guide to 
those naturalists who may have felt the want of correct information on the 
present habitats and breeding stations of many of our interesting birds, 
which have either become very rare or been driven altogether to localities 
out of the reach of the ordinary tourist.

GENERAL GRINDING MILLS, 
6B£ME STREET (OFF HIGH STREET.) 

DAVID MINTO 

)ESIRES to intimate that he has now erected those new and extensive premises upon the old site of ground, 
Macpherson Street, with a frontage to that street, recently formed, called Graeme Street (off High Street), 
od has fitted up additional new Mills and Machines of different kinds, with every improvement, in order to 
icilitate the operations of his trade in its various branches. And while it has been his constant aim to supply 
le wants of his customers with all speed and convenience, he has much pleasure in stating that he is now in 
better position than ever to meet the demands of Grocers, Confectioners, Biscuit Manufacturers, Druggists, 
yers, Drysalters, &amp;c. , with all the appliances which his new machinery can afford. 

A French scientific gentleman, who has directed his attention to this subject, says : — "I have found that 
offee is better roasted, and more of the aroma retained, when a double cylinder is used— the air between the 
iterior and exterior cylinders acting as a non-conductor of heat. It is done more uniformly, while the 
jsential oil on which the aroma depends is less liable to be dispersed than when exposed to the fierce heat of 
fire in a single cylinder." 

In the double rotatory globular method of roasting as practised at Mr. Minto's Works, Graeme Street, 
lasgow, the above principle is acted upon, inasmuch as the globe (which has superseded the cylinder since 
le application of steam-power to this branch) revolves in a medium of heated air, which experience has shown 
;st prevents the dispersion of the essential oil, or aroma.

THE CORPORATION OF THE 




COTTISH CROVIDENT 

INSTITUTION. 

No. 6 ST. ANDREW SQUARE, EDINBURGH. 



This Office alone combines the advantages of 
Mutual Assurance with Moderate Premiums. 

The PREMIUMS are so moderate that at most 
ages an assurance of ^1200 or ^1250 may be secured 
from the first for the same yearly payment which would 
elsewhere assure ^*rooo only. 

The whole PROFITS go to the Policyholders, on a 
system at once safe, equitable, and favourable to good lives 
— no share being given to those by whose early death 
there is a loss. The effect of reserving the surplus for the 
survivors (who will, however, comprise more than half the 
members) has been that policies for £1000 have already 
been increased to ^1400, ^"1600, and even to ^*i8oo. 

The FUNDS are securely invested, chiefly on 
mortgage of lands and other non-fluctuating securities. 
The amount— above Two Millions — is larger (not- 
withstanding the lowness of the premiums) than in any 
Office in the Kingdom of the same age.

[Tlie.se Kates are about as low as the usual non-participating Rates.] 
* A person of 30 may thus secure £1000 at Death, by a yearly payment, during life, of £20 : 15s. This 
Premium, if paid to any other of the Scottish Mutual Offices, would secure £800 only, instead of £1000. 

OR, if unwilling to burden himself with payments during his whole life, he may secure the same sum of 
£1000 by twenty-one yearly payments of £27 : 13 : 4— being thus free of payment after age 50. 

t At age 40 the Premium ceasing at age 60, is, for £1000, £33:14:2, being about the same as most 
Offices require to be during the whole term of life.

MALVERN S ELTZER WATER. 

In order to manufacture an Artificial Water, which shall be a successful imitat i 
of the natural Spring, a perfect solution of the Chemical Ingredients is essential, t 
this can alone be effected by the aid of PUKE WATER It was the knowledj 
this important fact that induced J. SCHWEPPE &lt;fe Co. to establish 
Manufacture of 

ARTIFICIAL SELTZER WATER, AT MALVERN, 

Where they have leased the Spring of the Holy Well, so renowned for its 
and purity. From the remarkable efficiency of this Water as a solvent of 
CHLORIDES and CARBONATES which form the ingredients of the natural S] 
at Nassau, J. SCHWEPPE &amp; Co. are enabled to produce a SELTZER W/ 
possessing all those CHEMICAL and MEDICINAL properties which hfve rend 
the original Spring so celebrated. It is prepared as an Crated Water, and maj 
recommended to the public generally, as at all times a most refreshing «uid delightf. 
beverage. B
