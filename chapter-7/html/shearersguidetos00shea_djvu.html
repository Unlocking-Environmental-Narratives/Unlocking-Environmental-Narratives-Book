STIRLING. 
Railway Station to the Castle. 

TWENTY MINUTES' WALK. 

( Cabs from the Station to Castle are charged 2S. 6a 1 ., and is. for 
every half hour kept.) 

To visitors arriving at Stirling, the chief attraction is Stirling 
Castle. By turning to bird's-eye Plan, tourists will have no 
difficulty in finding their way. Stirling Castle is most intimately 
connected with the chief events of Scottish history, and takes 
an important place in the scenes of Scott's " Lady of the Lake." 
The historic buildings of the Town and Castle are among the 
finest in Scotland, and the view from the Castle Rock, over the 
Carse of Stirling, interwoven with the silvery links of Forth, 
with the battlefields and mountains, is unequalled. 

Leaving the Railway Station, you pass up the Station Road, 
crossing over what at one time was the ground of the Black- 
friars Monastery. 

At the head of Station Road stands the Free North Church 
with spire, and the Arcade, which leads to Arcade Hall and 
King Street. 

Turning to the left, along Murray Place, a little further on 
King Street is reached. The corner building on the right is 
the British Linen Co.'s Bank, formerly Drummond's Tract 
Depot. From the foot of King Street the tramway Cars 

start for Bridge of Allan and Wallace Monument.

10 STIRLING. 

At the top of King Street stands the Burgh Buildings, with 
a fine statue of Sir William Wallace surmounting the entrance. 

Continue your walk straight up either of the streets, Baker 
Street or Spittal Street, which go right and left of the Burgh 
Buildings. There is a walk through the trees called the Back 
Walk, which runs parallel with these two streets, and comes out 
at Stirling Castle. This can be entered to the left of Burgh 
Buildings by the Corn-Exchange. 

Passing up Spittal Street, the Royal Infirmary and High 
School are passed. Continuing straight up St. John Street, 
you pass the Military Prison on the left. Here take short street 
to the right and enter Broad Street, at one time the most 
important street of the town. 

There are a number of quaint old buildings in Broad Street. 
Nursery of James VI., Darnley's House, is situated near the 
bottom. The Old Town House, built in 1701, and the Cross, 
restored 1891, stand about the centre. The building in ruins 
at the top of street is Mar's Work, built by the Earl of Mar, 
the stones being taken from Cambuskenneth Abbey when it 
was demolished. (See Cambuskenneth Abbey). The royal 
arms of Scotland and the arms of the Earl adorn the walls. 
The following singular inscription will also be observed : —

Entering Castle Wynd, on the right is Argyll House, a fine old 
mansion of the sixteenth century. It was built by the cele- 
brated poet and statesman, Sir William Alexander, created Earl 
of Stirling by Charles I., but passed into the family of the Duke 
of Argyll, and is now used as a Military Hospital. Passing on 
and up, the Castle is at once reached— or, the way may be

taken by the old church and cemetery. If time does not 
press, retrace your steps past the fine end window, and enter 
by the gate. 

A charge of 2d. is made for admission into the church. This 
grand old historic building, The High Church (also called 
the Greyfriars), now East and West Parish Churches, dates 
from the twelfth century. James VI. was crowned here 
in 1567, the celebrated reformer Knox preaching on the 
occasion. The Royal infant was only 13 months and 10 days 
old. In very old documents the West Church is called " The 
Church of the Holy Cross,'' and in a deed of Cowane's — 1637 
— "The Rude Kirk." In old deeds — 1372 to 1506 — it is 
recorded that in the nave of the church there were many 
altars, dedicated to the Holy Cross, St. Laurence, Our Ladie, 
St. John, St. Thomas, St. Ninian, &amp;c, &amp;c. One of the small 
chapels is called Queen Margaret's, after the Tudor princess 
married to James IV. in 1503. On the arch will be seen the 
English rose and the Scottish thistle. 




High Church. 

The Guild Hall, or Cowane's Hospital, is to the left, 
and is free to visitors. The quaint style of architecture, 
enriched with Scripture texts, and bearing date 1639, 
coupled with the charitable intentions of the founder, give it a 
deep interest to the philanthropist and the antiquarian. 
The following inscription is over the entrance : — This Hospital

The Cemetery, Ladies' Rock, Martyrs' 

Monument. 

Passing up the steps at tower of church, cross over in the 
direction of the highest point in the Cemetery, the Ladies' 
Rock, and at its base will be seen an attraction for visitors, 
The Virgin Martyrs, a marble group covered with glass. This 
statue was erected to perpetuate the memory of two simple 
maidens. History records that on the nth May, 1685, Margaret 
Maclachlan and Margaret Wilson, the latter only 18 years, suf- 
fered death by drowning in the Sol way during the time of the Per- 
secution, being tied to stakes and drowned by the risingof the tide. 

Ascending to the top of the Ladies' Rock, towards the west a 
very fine view can be had of the mountains, Ben Lomond, Ben 
Ledi, Ben Vorlich ; and below, towards the south, the King's

Knot and Royal Gardens, King's Park, and, in the distance, 
the Flagstaff on the Field of Bannockburn. An indicator or 
chart has been erected on the Ladies' Rock from which tourists 
can learn the names of many other objects of interest. 
(Copies printed on drawing paper, 1/ each, can be had from the 
publishers of this Guide). Descending from the Ladies' Rock,

a gate close at hand will be seen leading out of Cemetery 
to the Back Walk, along which, should time permit, some 
fine views are to be seen. Turning to the right, there is a flight 
of steps leading to the Esplanade in front of the Castle. To 
the right of the Castle entrance is the Statue of King Robert 
Bruce. Bruce looks to the field of Bannockburn, is clad in 
mail, and appears sheathing his sword, as if the victory were 
won and Scotland free. The Scottish shield and lion are on 
the front of the pedestal, and on the west side, " King Robert 
the Bruce, June 24, 1314," the date of the Battle of Bannock- 
burn — unveiled 24th November, 1877. The view from the 
Esplanade is very grand. The winding Forth and bridges 
lie below, and, across the valley, the Abbey Craig, Wallace 
Monument, and the Ochils from a noble background. 



Stirling: Castle. 

GUIDES inside the Castle are appointed to conduct Visitors through the Castle at 
the following rates: — One Visitor ; 6d. ; two Visitors, ij ; three or a party, 1/6. 

Open free from sunrise to sunset ; on Sunday 's, from 1 to 2 and 4. 
to 6 o'clock. 

This fine old Castle is identified with the greatest events of 
Scottish history. A castle, or fort, existed here from pre-historic 
times. It was the royal residence of the Scottish Kings, and 
the favourite home of the Stuart line. Being the Key to the 
Highlands*, it stands amidst the great battlefields of Scotland. 
You enter the Castle by the drawbridge, passing over which you 
continue your way through the more modern outworks. 
Turning to your left before entering the old gateway, 
you arrive at the top of Queen Anne's Battery, from which a fine 
view of the Valley of the Forth towards the east is obtained, 
and looking towards the Castle, in front is the old gateway, on 
the left the Palace, and on the right the Parliament House. 
(The view here given shows the towers as they stood in the 
time of James V. and before the siege of Stirling Castle by 
General Monk in 1651). 

" The Castle gates were open flung, 
The quivering drawbridge rock'd and rung, 
And echo'd loud the flinty street 
Beneath the coursers' clattering feet, 
As slowly down the steep descent 
Fair Scotland's King and nobles went." — Lady of the Lake.

STIRLING CASTLE. 



Proceeding under the flagstaff, you enter the Lower Square of 
the Castle. On the left hand is the Palace, built by James V. 
This building is enriched with grotesque sculptured figures in the 
French style of the period. In the left-hand corner a covered 
way leads to the Lions' Den and Ladies' Look-out Battery, and

overlooks the wildest and most precipitous part of the rock on 
which the Castle is built. James VI. was educated by Buchanan 
in the square tower to the left. Beneath an archway which 
connects the Palace with the Parliament House you enter the 
Upper Square, where the same singular decorations will be 
observed on the east side of the Palace. On the right hand is 
the Parliament House, erected by James III. The last Parlia- 
ment held in Scotland opened its sittings here. This fine

building is now used for barracks, and the alterations made 
at various times have greatly obscured its original grandeur. 
Facing the Palace is the Chapel Royal (waiting-room for 
visitors ; temperance refreshments sold), built by James VI. for 
the baptism of his son, Prince Henry, the former and more 
ornate Chapel Royal on the same site having been damaged at 
the Reformation. A vault or chapel has recently been opened

below the present Chapel. The new building in the north-west 
corner is the restored portion of the Castle, destroyed by fire in 
1855, and contains the officers' quarters and the celebrated 
Douglas Room — access to which is obtained by the doorway at 
the end of the Chapel. On entering the flower garden, a flight 
of steps on the left hand leads to the Douglas Room. The 
room, and the closet where James II. stabbed the Earl of Douglas 
in 1452, are shown to visitors, and contain many interesting 
antiquarian articles.

father-in-law, the Earl of Lennox, an old man in his eightieth 
year, fell beneath the headsman's axe. Beyond lie the Bridges 
of Stirling, and, like a sentinel keeping watch and ward over the 
valley, is the Wallace Monument on the Abbey Craig. The 
scene of the Battle of Stirling Bridge was in the valley between. 
Bridge of Allan is seen opposite, then Keir, Blair Drummond, 
and the Braes of Doune, while to the far west the noble Gram- 
pians shut in the view. This point is called the Victoria 
Look-out, and an inscription is placed on the wall to com- 
memorate the visit made by Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen 
Victoria and the Prince Consort in 1842. At the end of the 
walk, an aperture in the wall is called the Queen Mary Look- 
out, where the beautiful but unfortunate Mary Stewart viewed 
the sports in the park when a resident in Stirling Castle. Hours 
might be spent in the Castle and in admiring the views from 
the various batteries — north, south, east, and west. 

"But it is not Stirling of which I need to speak, the 
glory of Scotland ; for who does not know its noble rock, rising 
the monarch of the landscape,* its majestic and picturesque 
towers, its amphitheatre of mountain, and the windings of 
its marvellous river; and who that has once seen the sun 
descending here in all the blaze of its beauty beyond the purple 
hills of the west, can ever forget the plain of Stirling, the endless 
charm of this wonderful scene, the wealth, the splendour, the 
variety, the majesty of all which here lies between earth and 
heaven!"— M'Culloch. 

To the Old Bridge. 

At the foot of Broad Street, to the right the Bow leads 
by Baker Street to King Street, where cars can be had for 
the Wallace Monument, passing on the way the Old 
Bridge. To the left the narrow St. Mary's Wynd leads to the 
Old Bridge, passing on the left Queen Mary's Palace, in ruins, 
and other old-fashioned gables. 

The old Bridge is the most interesting in Scotland, from 
its age, historical associations, and also its beauty. A bridge 
existed here from the earliest times, and being the only means 
of communication between the north and south, was the key to 
the Highlands. Further up the river, at Kildean, Sir William 
Wallace's great victory over the English army at the battle of 
Stirling Bridge, in 1297, took place. The present bridge played 
an important part in the rebellions of 17 15 and 1745. Cross 
over the Bridge and turn a few yards to the right, and the tram-

Street takes fully 10 minutes, and to Causewayhead, the stop- 
ping-place for the Monument, 15 minutes. 

The Smith Institute. 

The Smith Institute is situated at the west end of Albert 
Place, admission 2d. 

It contains a Picture Gallery, Museum, and Reading-Room. It was 
founded by the late Thomas Smith, Esq. of Glassingall, who bequeathed the 
sum of ^22,000 for the purpose, besides a collection of paintings. The 
Picture Gallery contains above 300 paintings, and specimens of the follow- 
ing artists' works are on the walls : — John Philip, R.A., Sam Bough, James 
Drummond, R.S.A., Sir George Harvey, Maris, Cox, Harding, &amp;c, &amp;c. 
In the Museum are the following antiquarian curiosities, viz : — The 
Stirling Pint Jug, of date 1438. The Standard Measure is an interesting 
relic of the reign of David I., and has had an eventful history. Chair of 
Rev. James Guthrie, the Martyr ; the original oak carving, the Stirling 
Heads, from the Palace of Stirling Castle ; the Jagg or Jougs, formerly 
attached to the Old Market Cross of Stirling ; calthrop, horse shoes, &amp;c, 
from Milton Bog, Bannockburn ; querns or handmills. 

King's Knot. 

A little to the west of the Institute is the King's Knot and 
Royal Gardens. These interesting historical remains are 
mentioned as early as the fourteenth century, and named the 
Round Table. Here took place the kingly sports and games. 



WALLACE MONUMENT. 1&amp; 

A little to the south is the King Park, which is one of the 
finest golf courses in Scotland. 

THE WALLACE MONUMENT 

(Admission Twopence, No. 2 on Map) 

Is erected on the Abbey Craig, situated about 2 miles from 
Stirling. Taking the tramway car, which starts frequently from 
the foot of King Street, we pass on the way Stirling Old Bridge. 
Leaving the car at Causewayhead, you proceed through the 
village. The Craig is free to the public. It is laid out with 
walks, and is a favourite resort of tourists, the views from every 
point being quite enchanting. 

The Abbey Craig was the position occupied by Wallace and 
his army immediately before the Battle of Stirling Bridge, while 
the heights of Stirling were held by the English. The site of 
the battle was in the plain immediately in front. 

Indicator charts have been erected at the top pointing out 
all objects of interest. 

Wallace Statue. 

Above the doorway will be seen a Bronze Statue of Sir William Wallace 
(Scotland's hero). It measures 13 feet in height, and the sword in his hand 
is 7 feet. 

In the Entrance Hall facing the door there stands a marble Bust of Rev. 
Charles Rogers, D. D. , LL. D. The first hall is a reception room for visitors, 
where tea, coffee, temperance refreshments, &amp;c, can be had. The second 
is decorated with ancient armour, and has beautiful stained glass windows 
representing the arms of Scotland, of Great Britain, of the Wallace family, 
and of the town of Stirling. The third contains the most interesting relic — 
the Wallace Sword, which measures 5 feet 6h inches in length, and is 2\ 
inches broad at the top, narrowing to j inch at the point. The Sword was 
taken from Wallace on 5th August, 1305, when he was betrayed and 
captured while he slept at Robroyston, and it remained in Dumbarton 
Castle till transferred to Stirling in 1888. This Hall is called the Hall of 
Heroes, and contains marble busts of the following eminent Scotsmen. 
The first on the left is 



1. Thomas Carlyle. 

2. Sir Walter Scott. 

3. William Murdoch. 

4. James Watt. 

5. John Knox. 

6. David Livingstone. 

7. Robert Tannahill. 



8. Robert Burns. 

9. Adam Smith. 

10. Thomas Chalmers. 

11. George Buchanan. 

12. Hugh Miller. 

13. King Robert the Bruce. 
Sir David Brewster. 



The four windows in this hall represent Sir William Wallace as he fought 
at Stirling Bridge, King Robert the Bruce, a Scottish spearman, and a 
Scottish archer as they fought at Bannockburn. 

The fourth hall is to be the Royal Chamber. 



20 CAMBUSKENNETH ABBEY. 



- 



View from the Tower. 
From the Tower may be seen the Links of the Forth, 
extending as far as the eye can reach, and the picturesque 
valley of Monteith, with the distant Grampians and their 
prominent peaks, Ben Lomond and Ben Ledi, Ben More, and 
mountains in the far distance, forming a panorama of unsurpassed 
grandeur.* 

The sites of a larger number of battles can be seen from the 
Craig than can be seen from any height in the country, the 
principal being, — 

I. — Cambuskenneth, 843, in reign of Kenneth II., between Scots and 

the Picts. 
2. — Stirling Bridge, between Sir William Wallace and the English 

army, commanded by the Earl of Surrey, 1 297. 
3. — Bannock burn, June 24th, 13 14. 
4. — Sauchie Burn (James III. cruelly killed), 1488. 
5. — Sheriffmuir, 17 15 (Rebellion). 

6. — In the distance Falkirk, 1298, between Wallace and the English. 
7.— ,, Falkirk (Rebellion), 1746. 

The visitor can either return by car, or, by taking a walk of 
ih miles, can reach the ancient Tower of Cambuskenneth. 

From Wallace Monument to Cambuskenneth and Stirling. 

Leaving the Monument, you can take the walk to the east, through the 
wood skirting the face of the Craig, and you will arrive, in about ten minutes, 
on the Alloa Road. Turn backwards along the public road, in the direc- 
tion of Causewayhead, take the railway crossing, which will be seen at a 
short distance on the left, cross the line, pass the crossing-keeper's house 
and a farm, and about half a mile further on Cambuskenneth Abbey will be 
reached. By crossing the £d. ferry at Cambuskenneth, Stirling can be 
reached in half an hour. 

CAMBUSKENNETH ABBEY. 

To reach the Abbey from Stirling, pass along Murray Place at 
Railway Station, turn down Forth Place as you leave the Post 
Office, going by way of the new high-level crossing dawn Forth 
Place, passing the steamboat quay, and, by crossing the ferry, 
arrive at Cambuskenneth Abbey in half-an-hour. 

The Abbey and lands are favourite resorts of tourists and townspeople 
during the fruit season, the orchards still existing in the Abbey grounds. 
The tower is the only remaining portion of this magnificent monastery, 
which extended over a large area of ground. The foundations of the nave, 
transept, chancel and other buildings can be traced out in the direction of 
the dove-cot, a small part of which still stands by the side of the Forth. 
The fine old doorway opposite the entrance to the tower, now used as the 
entrance to the churchyard, was one of the doorways entering to the nave.

CAMBUSKENNETH ABBEY. 



21 



The Trustees of Cowane's Hospital (Stirling) purchased the Abbey and 
land in 1709 from Sir John Erskine of Cambuskenneth and Alva, to whose 
family they had belonged since the Reformation. There were 29 abbots 
appointed from the year 1147 to 1640. The 28th was Adam Erskine ; and 
29th, the Honourable Alex. Erskine (soldier, son of John, Earl of Mar), 
from 1608 to 1640. It had become a gift to this family by Royal favour, 
and John, Earl of Mar, 1593, is mentioned as owner. At the time of the 
Reformation (1559), when Mary of Guise (Queen Mary's motner) was 
Regent in Stirling Castle, the Abbey was sacked by some Reforming 
rioters from Perth, and the stones have been carried off for building 
purposes. 

The Abbey was one of the numerous buildings founded by David I. 
(1 147) ("The Sore Saint"), and was for the monks of the Order of St. 
Augustine, and appropriated to the Virgin Mary. It had many royal 
charters from other monarchs, under the name of Church of St. Mary of 
Stirling. Early Scottish Parliaments often met in the Abbey, and it is 
interesting to know Robert the Bruce has been within these walls, and 
granted charters in favour of the Abbey. The lands and possessions were 
not confined to the neighbourhood only. 




Cambuskenneth Abbey and Tomb of James III. 

The Tower is open to visitors on payment of twopence. The height is 
about 70 feet, and the view from the top is well worth the ascent. Near 
the High Altar, the remains of James III., who fell at the Battle of Sauchie 
Burn, and his Queen were interred ; and in 1865 Her Most Gracious 
Majesty Queen Victoria caused a beautiful tomb to be erected on the spot, 
bearing this inscription : — 

" In this^place, near the High Altar of the Abbey of Cambuskenneth, are deposited 
the remains of James III., King of Scots, who died on the nth June, 1488; and of hib 
Queen, the Princess Margaret of Denmark." 



BANNOCKBURN. 



BANNOCKBURN. 

Starting from King Street, walk out by port Street and 
Pitt Terrace, passing Randolph Field and St. Ninians on the 
way to the Field of Bannock burn (which is not at the village 
of that name, but a little to the right after passing St. 
Ninians). 'Buses start frequently from the top of Station 
Road. At St. Ninians there will be noticed on the left the 




Borestone. 

steeple of the old church. Being used as a powder magazine 
in 1745 by Prince Charlie, the church on his retreat was blown 
up, leaving only the tower standing. The road branches after 
passing through the village, and we take the road to the right. 
The flagstaff will soon be seen in front. This new flagstaff was 
erected by the Oddfellows of Dumbarton in 1870, and at the 
side of it will be seen the iron grating which protects the 
original bored stone. 

The field of Bannockburn, the scene of the ever-memorable 
battle, fought on the 24th June, 13 14, between the English 
army, 100,000 strong, under Edward II, and the Scots, 
numbering 30,000, under Robert Bruce, is about 2 miles from 
Stirling. Never before had a more numerous or powerful force 
been led against Scotland, the enemy's cavalry alone being 
as numerous as the entire Scottish army. Bruce gained a 
glorious victory, of which the Scottish nation may well be proud. 
In the Borestone Bruce placed his standard, being the centre 
of the Scottish army ; in front, across the Bannock Burn, lay 
the English, and in the plain immediately beyond the Borestone 
the battle was waged. 

Battle of Sauchie Burn. 

About a mile and a half further on the Battle of Sauchie Burn was fought 
in 1488, between James III. and his nobility. The eldest spn of the 
King fought in the army against his father. The Royal forces were defeated. 
The King, when fleeing from the battlefield, was thrown from his horse

and was carried into Beaton's Mill at Milton, where he was treacherously 
stabbed, in the 35th year of his age and 28th of his reign. 1 lis remains were 
buried at Cambuskenneth Abbey. (See Abbey). 




Beaton's Mill.— James III. Killed. 

By turning to sketch map in Guide-Book, visitors will see Beaton's Mill 
is not many minutes' walk from the Borestone. The house is now occupied, 
and the room where the King was killed can be inspected. 



24 BRIDGE OF ALLAN. 



BRIDGE OF ALLAN. 

Bridge of Allan is three miles from Stirling, and two miles 
from Causewayhead and Abbey Craig. It is called the Queen 
of Scottish watering-places, being famous for its mineral springs, 
beautiful situation, and as a health-giving resort. The walks on 
the banks of the Allan water are also very fine. It possesses a 
large Hydropathic institution and first-class Hotels, and the 
lodging accommodation is of a superior description, suitable 
for all parties who may frequent this favourite spa. It is 
visited by thousands annually from all parts of the world. The 
Bridge of Allan Public Hall, Assembly Rooms, Museum and 
Picture Gallery, is well worth a visit. It is situated at the east 
end of the village at Coneyhill on the tramway route. 

Near Bridge of Allan are situated the following beautiful 
estates, which are open to visitors, viz. : — Airthrey, on Thursday ; 
Keir, on Friday, 2 till 6 p.m.; Kippenross, Wednesday and 
Saturday, from 10 a. m. till 5 p.m. 



DUNBLANE. 

Dunblane Hydropathic establishment occupies a commanding situation 
behind the town, and is enclosed in fine grounds. It is one of the largest 
establishments of this kind in the country, having accommodation for 250 
visitors. 

This is a very ancient city, and contains a population of 3186. The 
Cathedral is situated on the banks of the Allan, about 5 minutes' walk from 
the Railway Station. Crossing the bridge over the Allan, we pass the 
Stirling Arms Hotel and entrance gate to Kippenross grounds, then pass up 
the Main Street. Nearing the Cathedral, we pass the County Buildings on 
the right, and on the left the Leightonian Library, with the Bishop's arms 
on the wall, and then enter the Cathedral Square. It is open daily from 
10 to 5 from 1st April to 30th September, and 10 to 3 from 1st October to 
31st March ; Saturdays, 10 to 5. Admission, 3d. — paid to the custodier. 
The Culdees had a church or mission school here in the sixth century. 
The Cathedral has lately been restored under the care of Dr. Rowand 
Anderson, architect, Edinburgh, a roof being put over the nave. This will 
preserve one of the finest Gothic interiors in the country, although the 
picturesque ruin seen from the river side has been somewhat lost. The 
Cathedral was founded in 1 140 by King David I. It is a magnificent 
structure, and consists of a nave with aisles, a choir without aisles, a 
chapter house, and a square tower. The nave is 130 feet in length, 58 in 
breadth, and 50 in height. The choir is 80 feet in length, and 30 in breadth. 
The tower is the oldest portion, being Norman, and of the nth century. 
The Cathedral is in the pointed form of architecture, and was restored in 
the 13th century by Bishop Clement. The nave is much admired for its. 
architectural beauty, and in it are several ancient, flat, sculptured stones, 



DUNBLANE. 



25 



marking the last resting-place of the illustrious dead. The marble slabs 
in the chancel cover the graves of Bonnie Margaret Drummond and her two 
sisters, daughters of Lord Drummond of Drummond Castle, who, it is sup- 
posed, were poisoned. This dark deed in Scottish history occurred in 1494. 




MM 




Dunblane Cathedral (1892). 

The chasing of the stone-work of the western window and the small 
window above is particularly fine. The Cathedral is not of such an 
elaborate character as either Melrose or Rosslyn, but excels them in beauty 
of proportion and force of style. The prebendal stalls in black oak are 
richly carved, and the seats for the choristers have quaint carvings on them, 
viz., a cat, a fox, an owl, &amp;c. Among the 25 bishops who have held this 
see may be mentioned Maurice, formerly Abbot of InchafTray, chaplain to 
Robert Bruce, and who blessed the Scottish army on the eventful morning 
of the Battle of Bannockburn. Finlay Dermock, who was the bishop in 
the early part of the 15th century, built the bridge over the Allan here, 
which was widened a tew years since. Robert Leighton, an eminent 
scholar and author, was also one of its bishops. The 14,000 books compos- 
ing his library, which he left to the clergy of the diocese, belong to the 15th, 
16th, and 17th centuries, are classical and theological, and are desposited 
in a house near the Cathedral, on the outer wall of which is a marble tablet 
inscribed with the bishop's arms and the words, " Bibliotheca Leighton- 
iana." Many of the books have been lost, but there are still about 5000 
volumes left, which are being added to occasionally. The Bishop's Palace 
stood to the south of the church, and overlooked the river, and the Bishop's 
Walk and the Bishop's Well still retain their names. Mr. Ruskin, in a 
lecture in Edinburgh, expressed his admiration of the nave and west 
window, which has suffered much by exposure to the weather. 

The popular and touching song of Tannahill, " Jessie, the flower of Dun- 
blane," occurred to the poet from a walk by the Allan Water.

2i&gt; 



DOUNE. 



SHERIFFMUIR, 

4 miles north-east of Dunblane, is a favourite walk. There is an inn near 
the battle stone. This extensive moor derived its name from the military 
force of the county having in former times been exercised upon it, 
under the superintendence of the Sheriff. The muir is interesting as the 
scene of the memorable battle, fought on the 13th November, 171 5, by the 
Highland clans under command of the Earl of Mar, and the royal troops 
under the Duke of Argyll. The insurgent army numbered 10,000, while the 
royalist force consisted of only 3,300 men, the right wing being commanded 
by Argyll, and the right wing of the rebel army by Mar. The Highlanders 
fought in their usual style, making a fierce and rapid charge with the clay- 
more, while the royalists displayed great bravery. The fray was indecisive, 
the right wings of both armies being victorious — Mar routing Argyll's left, 
whom they pursued to Stirling ; while Argyll routed Mar's left, pursuing 
them across the Allan by the ravine of the Wharry Glen. Both leaders 
returned to the field of battle, but no further fighting took place. The 
advantages of the battle were on the side of the Government. About 1000 
fell, and of this number 700 belonged to the rebels. Rob Roy, with 500 of 
his clan, was on the ground, but took no part in the fray. 




Doune and Doune Castle. 

The village has a population of about 1000, has a good Hotel, and is well 
supplied with Churches. The Old Cross of Doune is worth noticing, and 
has lately been restored. On leaving the Railway Station, the street to the 
left leads to the Castle, which is at the east end of the village, situated on a 
knoll, at a point where the Ardoch Burn joins the Teith. The Castle is now 



DOUNE. 27 



one of the most interesting ruins in Scotland, and its early history is full of 
antiquarian interest. The tower is about 80 feet in height, and from the 
battlements the view, for extent and beauty, can hardly be surpassed. The 
courtyard is enclosed with a wall 38 feet high and 7 feet thick. At the 
entrance is the old iron portcullis, which could be dropped in any emergency. 
The various rooms and halls will be shown by the keeper, who has 
published a small hand-book to the Castle, containing most interesting 
information. The Earl of Moray, in 1883, carried out the repair and 
restoration of the Castle. The banqueting hall is 67 feet long, 26 feet wide, 
and 40 feet high, and adjoining it is the kitchen, with a capacious fireplace 
18 feet wide. Queen Mary's room, on the second floor, is 27 feet long and 
17 feet wide. The Castle dates from the 13th century, and was in 
possession of Murdoch, Duke of Albany, in 1425. Since 15 18 it has 
belonged to the family of Moray. It was held for Prince Charles Edward 
Stewart in 1745, and the prisoners taken at the battle of Falkirk were sent 
on to Doune Castle. The old gallows tree, which stood in front of the 
Castle, was blown down in 1878, and the Earl of Moray has had the wood 
made into old style furniture, bearing the arms of Moray, and now placed in 
the baron's hall. 

On the other side of the river Teith Blair Drummond Castle, the 
residence of Colonel Home-Drummond, stands on rising ground in the large 
policies of Blair Drummond, commanding most magnificent views of the 
Western Grampians, and to the east the valley of the Forth. 

An immense amount of moss land — 2300 acres — formed part of the 
estate ; but by the enterprise of a former laird, and the ingenuity of an 
artisan, a wheel of immense size was erected, so as to raise the water to a 
higher level, while channels were cut in the moss, and the moss itself was 
floated into the river Forth. The moss land was leased at a low rent till 
reclaimed, and it now forms some of the best farms to be found on the 
estate. Many interesting antiquarian articles have been discovered from 
time to time. The bones of a whale were found about a quarter of a mile 
from the Manse ; beds of various kinds of sea shells ; numerous trunks of 
trees ; an oak 50 feet in length. 

In the sixteenth century Doune was celebrated for the making of pistols. 

Between Doune and Callander, Buchany, Burn of 
Cambus, and Doune Lodge are passed, while Lanrick 
Castle is on the opposite side of the Teith. A beautiful 
glimpse of the river Teith is had when passing the Highland 
hamlet of Drumvaich. 

About six miles from Doune is Cambusmore House, the 
residence of J. B. Baillie Hamilton, Esq. It was here that Sir 
Walter Scott spent his summer holidays, and from which he 
would enter the Highlands and write his picture-poem, the Lady 
of the Lake. No better description can be given of the country 
than the following by Sir Walter : — 



11 Along thy banks, swift Teith! they ride, 
And in the race they mock thy tide ; 
Torry and Lenrick now are past, 
And Deanstown lies behind them cast ; 



28 CALLANDER. 



They rise, the banner'd towers of Doune, 
They sink in distant woodland soon ; 
Blair Drummond sees the hoofs strike fire, 
They sweep like breeze through Ochtertyre ; 
They mark just glance and disappear 
The lofty brow of ancient Keir ; 
They bathe their coursers' sweltering sides, 
Dark Forth ! amid thy sluggish tides, 
And on the opposing shore take ground, 
With splash, with scramble, and with bound. 
Right hand they leave thy cliffs, Craigforth ! 
And soon the bulwark of the North, 
Grey Stirling, with her towers and town, 
Upon their fleet career looked down." 

The mansion house ofTheGartis passed after Cambusmore, 
and the Kelty water is crossed, on which, about half a mile up- 
wards, are the celebrated falls of Bracklinn. The Roman camp 
is on the left. 

CALLANDER. 

Callander (probably derived from the Gaelic Caldin-doir — 
meaning the Hazel Grove) is situated in the county of Perth, and 
has a population of 1538 (census 1891), but this is largely 
increased during the summer season. The town is well supplied 
with Hotels. The Old Castle of Callander stood near the parish 
manse, by the side of the river Teith. The Castle was a seat 
of the Livingstons, Earls of Linlithgow and Callander. The 
town is under the care of the Police Commissioners, and many 
improvements have been introduced. A new hall has been 
erected, suitable for concerts, &amp;c. Tennis and bowling greens, 
and also a golfing course, give much pleasure to those interested 
in these games. The shops are of a superior class, and ample 
accommodation is to be had at the hotels and lodging-houses. 
Many of the villas are let by the season. The Callander 
Hydropathic, opened in 1882, is situated about one mile south- 
west of Callander, and was almost totally destroyed by fire in 
1893. The road is by the bridge over the Teith, thence to 
the right by the Invertrossachs road, the river side, and the 
woods of Gartchonzie. The river Teith flows past the village, 
and is joined by the mountain stream, the Kelty, about a mile 
further down. From the bridge a magnificent view is obtained 
of the mountains, the Pass of Leny, and the meeting of the 
waters in the lovely valley. The river to the left comes from

Lubnaig, Lochs Doine and Voil. Both unite near the bridge, 
and form the Teith. Callander is a good centre for exploring 
the Highlands or enjoying the fishing on the lakes and streams.

Callander Bridge and Ben Ledi. 

The ascent of Ben Ledi (Beinne-le-Dia, "Hill of God") 
can be readily accomplished, the distance to the top from 
Callander being 4^ miles. The route is by the Trossachs 
road, by the farm of Coilantogle, 2}^ miles from Callander, at 
the foot of Loch Vennacher. A steeper and grander route is 
by the Pass of Leny, crossing the river by an iron bridge about 
3 miles from Callander. A very extensive view of moun- 
tain peaks, lake, and river is to be obtained from the summit, 
extending from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. Guides, if desired, 
can be had by applying at the hotels. A small lake near the 
summit of Ben Ledi is named Loch-an-nan-Corp, the Gaelic 
translated, M Lake of Dead Bodies." Tradition says a funeral 
party coming from Glenfinlas, to the Churchyard of St. Bride 
at Strathyre, in winter, attempted to cross the loch or tarn on 
the ice. The ice gave way, and many were drowned.

Pool,'' a romantic waterfall on the mountain stream, the Kelty. 
The distance from Callander to the Falls is about a mile. The 
road to the Falls is at the east end of the village, right above 
the old Railway Station, by a strip of wood, and along a fine 
upland grassy footway. Beautiful scenes, near at hand and afar 
off, burst upon the view. If the Kelty is in flood, the visitor 
will not be disappointed. The water rushes and boils over 
rocks and boulders into narrow gorges, and finally leaps over 
the big fall, fully 50 feet down, with a thundering noise. A 
rustic wooden bridge spans the falls, and care is required in 
viewing the scenery, as fatal accidents have occurred, the stones 
and rocks not being good footing. 

The Roman Camp, a mansion at the east end of 
Callander, derives its name from the many circular mounds of 
earth in the grounds, supposed to have Roman origin. 

" Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines 
On Bochastle the mouldering lines, 
Where Rome, the empress of the world, 
Of yore her eagle wings unfurled." 

Doubts are thrown out as to the Roman origin of such mounds. 
Many suppose they are caused by the action of water and heavy 
floods. A circular mound, clearly artificial, is near the hotel at 
the bridge, and is called Tom-ma-chessaig — the hill of Kessaig % 
the mound of Saint Kessac, whose anniversary is held on the 
21st of March. It was the site of an old cell or chapel, dedi- 
cated to St. Kessaig. 

The Pa.SS Of Leny, two miles from Callander, is a 
favourite excursion, and presents very grand scenery. The 
route can be continued to Loch Lubnaig. 



CALLANDER TO LAKE OF MENTEITH (A DRIVE OF SIX MILES). 

The road is by the bridge over the Teith, and in a straight 
line for nearly two miles, passing farms and sloping hills, and 
on the left, on the eastern side of the river, the mansion of The 
Gart. At the farm of the Braes of Greenoak take the road to 
the right, passing Letter Muir and Loch Ruskie, with its small 
island, on which are the ruins of the old Castle of Sir John 
Menteith, the betrayer of the patriot Wallace. About a mile 
onward is Rednock House and Rednock Castle. The right 
hand road leads to the Lake of Menteith, which bursts upon

CALLANDER TO COMRIE BY THE MOUNTAIN ROAD. (DISTANCE, 
15 MILES ) 
The pedestrian has in this route a noble field, and a fair day's work before

the Bracklinn road and Braeleny. The Kelty water is crossed, with Uamh 
Mohr or Uam Var to the right ; and on the left Benlarig and Stuck a 
Chroin, and more to the north Ben Voirlich, 3224 feet high. A descent is 
made by the Forest and Valley of Glenartney, passing Glenartney Lodge 
and the Water of Ruchill. The Valley of the Earn is entered and the 
Roman Camp is passed. The river Earn is crossed by an antique bridge, 
and the hotel will be a cheerful sight to the tired pedestrian.

THE TROSSJIGHS TOUR. 

The coaches are in waiting at the Railway Station, and no 
time is lost in making a start on the arrival of the trains. We 
pass on the right the Dreadnought Hotel, then a little further 
on the Episcopal Church and many fine villas. The mansion- 
house, grounds and woods of Leny (J. B. Hamilton, Esq.) 
appear on the right. The Leny river runs merrily past, 
clear and sparkling over its pebbly bed. The whistle of the loco- 
motive is heard while darting along the banks of the river 
before entering the Pass of Leny. The hamlet of Kilmahog is 
now passed, and the road to the left is taken, leading to the 
Trossachs, passing the lone churchyard of Kilmahog. (The 
road to the right leads to the Pass of Leny and Loch Lubnaig. 
See page 30). The Leny water is next crossed, where a fine 
view is obtained. Bochastle heath is on the left, and near at 
hand, on a spur of Ben Ledi, are the remains of an old fort, 
called the Dun of Bochastle, supposed to be of Roman origin. 
On the opposite side of the river are the woods of Gartchonzie 
(the " Woods of Lamentation :" a fierce clan battle having taken 
place here in days of old). A bridge crosses the river to 
Dullater and by Gartchonzie to Callander. Loch Vennachar 
now comes in view, and the works in connection with the 
Glasgow Water Company. Near at hand is Coil ant Ogle 
Ford, the point to which Roderick Dhu promised to lead 
Fitz-James — 

" Far past Clan Alpine's outmost guard," 

and where the fight took place, which is so graphically told by 
Sir Walter Scott in the Lady of the Lake — 

" They tug, they strain, down, down they go, 
The Gael above, Fitz-James below." 

The ascent of Ben Ledi is usually made by the farm-house 
of Coilantogle, on the right, 2^ miles from Callander. A large 
stone will be observed resting on the shoulder of the hill : it is 
called Samson's Putting-Stone. The stone is one of many 
supposed to have been dropped from a drifting iceberg in the 
Ice Age. The tradition regarding this stone is, that Samson 
endeavoured one morning to putt this stone from the top of 
Ben Lomond to the top of Ben Ledi, and the reason it fell 
short was, that Samson had not breakfasted.

LOCH VENNACHAR. 






Loch Vennachar, the Lake of the Fair Valley, is 5 
miles in length and nearly ij^ miles in breadth. The road 
leads along its shores for a considerable distance, and if the day 
is favourable the mirror-like effects of the mountain shadows 
are very striking. Tourists who venture on our Highland lochs 
should be very careful, especially those unaccustomed to boats, 
and to the squalls that come so fiercely from the glens. Mid-

way on the opposite shore is Invertrossachs House. At this 
fine Highland home our gracious Queen, accompanied by the 
Princesses Louise and Beatrice, and other members of the 
Royal Family, spent some weeks in the autumn of 1869. The 
Royal party made several excursions, visiting the Trossachs, 
Loch Katrine, Lake of Menteith, &amp;c. Her Majesty was 
graciously pleased to accept a copy of this Guide during her 
stay at Invertrossachs. 

THE QUEEN'S VISIT TO .THE TROSSACHS. 

Extracted from the newspapers of 6th September, i86g. 

On Saturday the Queen took a pleasure trip through the Trossachs, and 
a sail on Loch Katrine and Loch Lomond. The Royal party, which con- 
sisted of Her Majesty, Princess Louise and Princess Beatrice, and attend- 
ants, left Invertrossachs House at 9, and the morning being fine, the 
beauties of the district were seen to great advantage. The Royal party 
occupied two carriages, and the road taken was by Loch Drunkie and Loch 
Achray, and at the Trossachs the fairy steamer " Rob Roy" was in waiting 
at the pier. The tops of Ben Venue and Ben A'an were capped with mist, 
and the lower mountain ridges and the richly-wooded Trossachs Glen 
appeared in picturesque beauty under the rays of an autumnal sun. The 
Royal party arrived at Inversnaid, Loch Lomond, about 11.30. The sun 
shone out, dispelling the haze from off the mountains, and Ben Vorlich, Ben 



BRIG O' TURK. 35 



Vane, Ben A'an, and Ben Arthur, or The Cobbler, all stood out in sublime 
grandeur. The steamer " Prince Consort" was placed at Her Majesty's 
command. It was gaily decked with flowers and the purple heather. The 
Union Jack waved gracefully at bow and stern. The directors of the Loch 
Lomond Steamboat Company received the Royal party. The steamer, on 
leaving Inversnaid, steered by the eastern shore, keeping close to Ben 
Lomond, and went down the Loch to Balloch, returning to the head of 
Loch Lomond, and back to Inversnaid. The sound of the bagpipes was 
occasionally heard from the shore. At the various landing-places every one 
vied with another to show how loyal they were to the illustrious tourists. 
The Royal visitors freely used their sketch books from Luss to Tarbet, Ben 
Lomond being clear to the summit. The Royal party had a good view of 
the Falls and Glen of Inversnaid from the steamer. Before leaving, Her 
Majesty expressed to Alexander Smollett, Esq., M.P., and the other 
directors, how much gratified she was by the excursion on the Loch. The 
carriages were in waiting, and the Royal party returned by the same route 
to Invertrossachs. 

Near the head of Loch Vennachar is Lanrick Mead, the 
mustering-place of Clan Alpine, and where the shrill whistle of 
Roderick Dhu brought forth Clan Alpine's warriors true — 

" Instant, through copse and heath, arose 
Bonnets, and spears, and bended bows ; 
On right, on left, above, below, 
Sprung up at once the lurking foe." 

The head of the Loch is now gained, and from the rising 
ground a beautiful view is obtained of the Lake of the Fair 
Valley. The richly wooded banks, the green slopes, the grand 
mountain scenery, and the placid lake form a picture of great 
beauty. A fine stream of water, Dhu Abhainn (Black River), 
meanders from Loch Achray through the valley, and, passing 
by the Highland cots of Duncraggan, falls into Loch Vennachar. 
A short distance onwards the ruins of the old Brig o' Turk 
Hotel are passed. Near at hand is the old burying-place of 
Duncraggan, " the Stronghold of the Rock/' the last resting- 
place of the Highlanders in the district. To the right is Glen- 
finlas and the Brig o' Turk hamlet. A short distance 
up the Glen a waterfall can be seen. The scenery of Glenfinlas 
is very fine, and many a Highland tradition is mentioned in 
connection with this glen. Scott writes — 

u Whose waters their wild tumult toss 
Adown the black and craggy boss 
Of that huge cliff, whose ample verge 
Tradition calls the Hero's Targe." 

Glenfinlas in the days of the Stewart Kings was a Royal deer 
forest, and a field, called the King's Field, and the King's 



36 LOCH AC H KAY. 



Seat, where they dined, are pointed out. The Hero's Targe 
and Macgregor's Shiel are places of interest and beauty. 
Tradition says an outlaw on one occasion found shelter in a 
cave at the fall, and that a Highland girl stealthily lowered food 
to him by means of a rope, he drawing water from the pool 
below. He thus evaded his pursuers for long. The story is 
used by Sir Walter Scott. 

The Brig o' Turk (Wild Boar) is a resort of artists when the 
pines and mountain ash and oaks are decked in green, and the 
hills are all aglow with the purple heather. Lodgings are to be 
had in the Highland cots in the neighbourhood. A post-office 
and a telegraph-office connect it with the outside world, and the 
Callander and Loch Katrine coaches pass and repass frequently. 
Leaving the hamlet, the coach crosses the Finglas by the 
brig, which is brought into notice in the Royal Chase in the 
Lady of the Lake — 

" Few were the stragglers, following far, 
That reached the lake of Vennachar ; 
And when the Brigg of Turk was won, 
The headmost horseman rode alone." 

The run by coach down hill from Brig o' Turk to Loch 
Achray is most beautiful. Loch Achray (Lake of the Field of 
Devotion, from an ancient Druidical circle that stood on the 
west shore) is about one mile in length, and less than half a mile 
in breadth. Dundarroch house (Captain Munro) is on the left. 
The road skirts the margin of the lake, and the banks are 
clothed with birch and oak almost to the water's edge, so vividly 
described by Sir Walter Scott — 

" The copsewood grey, 
That waved and wept on Lock Achray, 
And mingled with the pine-trees blue 
On the bold cliffs of Ben Venue." 

Glenbruach House is passed on the right. Half-way along the 
banks of the lake is the Trossachs Manse, and a little further 
on to the left is the neat parish church. Achray House is at 
the head of the loch. This is a picture of quiet repose — 

" Bosky thickets sleep 
So stilly on thy bosom deep, 
The lark's blithe carol, from the cloud, 
Seems for the scene too gaily loud." 

How calm and peaceful the Sabbath morning dawns on these 



88 THE TROSSACHS. 

mountain rocks and glens : the bleating of the sheep, the sound 
of the church bell echoing among the mountains, and the wor- 
shippers wending their way from the scattered rustic hamlets, 
is a scene not easily forgotten. The loch forms a bay at this point, 
and a small island gems its surface. The Trossachs Hotel, 
called also Ardcheanochrochan (a Gaelic word signifying " the 
high end of the rock/') is soon reached. Here the coaches stop 
to give time for luncheon (2/6). This large and elegant hotel 
occupies the site of a farm-house, which supplied the wants of 
the tourists half a century ago. The hotel was erected in 1849 
by Lord Willoughby d'Eresby, from designs by Mr. Kennedy 
of London, but has been repeatedly extended. The hotel is 
capital headquarters for exploring the Trossachs and mountains 
around, and making excursions to the various places of interest 
in the district. The Trossachs proper (Troschen, bristled land) 
extends from the hotel to Loch Katrine, about a mile. This 
beautifully wooded glade is traversed by several delightful 
walks. One leads off to the left and crosses the stream at the 
sluices, beyond which to the right is the path to the Pass of 
Bealachnambo(Pass of the Cattle) from which a fine view of Loch 
Katrine is obtained. This pass is also a route for ascending 
Ben Venue. From the sluices the return to the hotel can be 
made by the side of Ben Venue, the Pass of Achray. Another 
path is the old Pass of the Trossachs. The path leads to the 
right a little beyond the hotel, and regains the road by the side 
of the loch a little beyond the pier. The angler has four lakes, 
viz., Lochs Katrine, Achray, Vennachar, and' Drunkie, to choose 
from — trout are plentiful, and salmon and pike are occasionally 
caught. Boats with attendants can be had by applying at the 
hotel. 

The hill immediately behind the hotel is Sron-Armailte, 
1 149 feet, and the ascent is made by the path from the gate at 
the east side of the hotel. A fine view is obtained by ascend- 
ing even a small part of the way. The ascent of Ben A'an, 
1750 feet, is made by the burnside to the west of the hotel. A 
grand view is the reward, but a fine day and caution are required. 
Aberfoyle and Loch Ard, Rob Roy's country, can be readily 
visited by the new road and the Brig o* Turk and Glenfinlas 
form a pleasant walk or drive. To see this end of Loch 
Katrine to advantage a boat should be taken at the pier and 
Ellen's Isle and the Silver Strand visited. 



40 THE TROSSACIIS. 



THE ABERFOYLE ROUTE. 



Coaches now run from Aberfoyle Railway Station to the 
Trossachs, a hill road of 6 miles. It presents some fine moun- 
tain scenery. Loch Drunkie is seen in a valley on the route, 
and later a magnificent bird's-eye view of the Trossachs from 
the heights above Loch Achray. 



THE TROSSACHS. 

Leaving the Trossachs Hotel the coach route 
is joined on the left by the Aberfoyle Road, and then at once 
enters the Pass of the Trossachs. Here a charming scene 
presents itself. All around are graceful birch trees, the ground 
is richly clad with heather, bracken and moss, the sky is pierced 
on the south by the bold cliffs of Ben Venue, while on the 
north Ben A'an rears his weather-beaten brow — 

" High on the south, huge Ben Venue 
Down on the lake in masses threw 
Crags, knolls, and mounds confusedly hurled, 
The fragments of an earlier world." 

The gorge or narrow defile among wild rocks is supposed to be- 
the scene in the Lady of the Lake where the stag escaped : — 

" Dashing down a darksome glen, 
Soon lost to hound and hunter's ken, 
In the deep Trossach's wildest nook 
His solitary refuge took." 

Near the same place is the glade, Beal-an-Dhuine (the " Pass, 
of the Man "). The name is said to point to a tragic legend or 
story of the days of old. Cromwell's soldiers found their way 
to the wilds of the Trossachs, and a Highlander shot one of the 
men. The Highlanders had placed their wives on an island in. 
Loch Katrine, removing the boats. One of the soldiers swam 
to the island to bring away a boat to carry over a party to. 
revenge the death of his comrade, and as he was laying his hand 
on a jutting rock, a Highland matron laid hold of him, and with a 
dagger, or skein dhu, severed his head from his body. No&lt; 
more attempts were made to reach the island. The heroine 
was Ellen Stewart, from whom the island takes its name. In 
1806 her great grandson lived at the Brig o' Turk, and the 
story is considered authentic in the district. A beautiful dell, 
enriched with foliage of birch and oak, is pointed out as the-

place where the "gallant grey," so graphically described by 
Scott, after his long run, fell to rise no more — 

11 Stumbling in the rugged dell, 
The gallant horse exhausted fell. 
The impatient rider strove in vain 
To raise him with the spur and rein, 
For the good steed, his labours o'er, 
Stretched his stiff limbs to rise no more." 

Leaving behind his gallant grey, Fitz-James continued his 
journey to Loch Katrine, which is described by Scott in the 
following lines : — 

" And now, to issue from the glen, 
No pathway meets the wanderer's ken, 
Unless he climb, with footing nice, 
A far projecting precipice. 
The broom's tough roots his ladder made, 
The hazel saplings lent their aid ; 
And thus, an airy point he won, 
Where, gleaming with the setting sun, 
One burnish'd sheet of living gold, 
Loch Katrine lay beneath him roll'd." 

No better description of the Trossachs defile can be given than 
is so vividly depicted by Scott in the following lines : — 

" The western waves of ebbing day 
Rolled o'er the glen their level way ; 
Each purple peak, each flinty spire, 
Was bathed in floods of living fire. 
But not a setting beam could glow 
Within the dark ravines below, 
Where twined the path in shadow hid, 
Round many a rocky pyramid 
Shooting abruptly from the dell 
Its thunder-splintered pinnacle. 
Boon nature scattered, free and wild, 
Each plant or flower, the mountain's child. 
Here eglantine embalm'd the air, 
Hawthorn and hazel mingled there ; 
The primrose pale and violet flower 
Found in each cliff a narrow bower ; 
Foxglove and nightshade, side by side, 
Emblems of punishment and pride." 

Issuing from the Trossachs Glen Loch Katrine comes 
in view. The loch is of serpentine form, about 9 miles in 
length and 1 in breadth. The steamer is waiting for the 
coach, but should time permit, or by waiting for the next

sailing,* the path by the side of the loch as far as the Silver 
Strand and Ellen's Isle should not be omitted. The lochs 
the Trossachs end is narrow, and is beautifully embowered 
amid heath-clad rocks, waving with oak and mountain ash — 

" A narrow inlet, still and deep, 
Affording scarce such breadth of brim 
As served the wild duck's brood to swim." 

About a mile from the pier on the right is Eilean Molach (or 
Ellen's Isle), beautifully clad with oak, birch, and heath, and 
soon the bay, famous for its pebbly beach, and known as the 
Silver Strand, appears on the right. At one time a beautiful 
grotto stood on the island, but it was unfortunately destroyed 
by fire in the summer of 1837. 

A pleasing view is obtained from the hill near the Trossachs 
Pier, and also from the heights near the Silver Strand. 

" One burnished sheet of living gold, 
Loch Katrine lay beneath him roll'd, 
In all her length far winding lay, 
With promontory, creek, and bay, 
And islands that, empurpled bright, 
Floated amid the livelier light, 
And mountains, that like giants stand, 
To sentinel enchanted land, 
High on the south huge Ben Venue 
Down on the lake in masses threw 
Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly hurl'd, 
The fragments of an earlier world ; 
A wildering forest feather'd o'er 
His ruined sides and summit hoar, 
While on the north, through middle air, 
Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare." 

The Steamer Rob Roy, on leaving the heath-clad, 
rustic pier, threads its way rapidly up the loch, quickly passing 
Ellen's Isle. About 2 miles onwards on the right is Brenachoil 
Lodge; and a mile further is Letter Farm and burn, also 
Edraleachdach and Strongalvaltrie farms. The mountain in the 
background is Crum Bhein, 1787 feet. A good road runs along 
the side of the loch to Glengyle. The north side of the loch is 
named Strathgartney. 

On the left hand, about a mile from the pier, is the Goblins' 
Cave (Coir-nan-Uris-kin) and Bealachnambo (or the Pass of 
Cattle), a fine glade rising about 700 feet above the lake. The 

* Rowing boats can be engaged at the pier to visit Ellen's Isle and Silver Strand.

CANTO FIRST. 



FIRST DAY. 

King James V., known in this poem as James Fitz- James, 
the Knight of Snowdoun (or Stirling), hunting with his 
followers in Glenartney's hazel shade, started a stag, which 
darted off across the wild heaths of Uam-Var, and continued 
its course through Cambusmore. After twice crossing the river 
Teith, and passing Bochastle, the hunt very probably followed 
Loch Vennachar's side, a course over much the same ground 
as that traversed by the present Trossachs road. 

" Few were the stragglers, following far, 
That reached the lake of Vennachar ; 
And when the Brigg of Turk was won, 
The headmost horseman rode alone." 

Fitz-James continued the pursuit alone by Loch Achray until, 
reaching the deep Trosachs' wildest nook, the stag was lost to 
hound and hunter's ken. The next misfortune to befall the 
King was the death of his gallant steed, — 

" But, stumbling in the rugged dell, 
The gallant horse exhausted fell." 

Finding his way by climbing up the cliffs, Fitz-James reaches 
an airy point, 

" Where, gleaming with the setting sun, 
One burnish'd sheet of living gold, 
Loch Katrine lay beneath him roll'd." 

Fitz-James blew his horn, expecting to attract some of his 
followers, which brought out from an island in a skiff Ellen 
Douglas, the Lady of the Lake, daughter of the outlawed 
Douglas, who thought the call was from her father. Fitz- 
James, on relating his misfortunes, was taken over to the

island in the skiff, and, known only as the Knight of Snowdoun, 
was hospitably entertained in the rustic home of the outlawed 
chief, Roderick Dhu, who at that time was providing a haven 
of refuge for the once powerful Lord Douglas and his daughter. 

" My hope, my heaven, my trust must be, 
My gentle guide, in following thee." 

The wondering stranger is impressed by seeing the large sword 
of the Douglas, which had slipped from its resting-place as he 
passed. 

" The hall was cleared — the stranger's bed 
Was there of mountain heather spread. 

He woke, and, panting with affright. 

Why is it at each turn I trace 
Some memory of that exiled race ? 
Can I not mountain maiden spy, 
But she must bear the Douglas eye ? 
Can I not view a Highland brand, 
But it must match the Douglas hand ? 
Can I not frame a fever 'd dream, 
But still the Douglas is the theme?"

In the first portion of this canto the early leave-taking of 
Fitz- James next morning is beautifully told, Ellen, and the old 
harper, who played and sang, witnessing the departure. 
"While yet he loiter'd on the spot, 
It seem'd as Ellen mark'd him not ; 
But when he turned him to the glade, 
One courteous parting sign she made." 

In a little time four barges came in sight, bringing Roderick 
Dhu and his followers to the island, singing the boat song, 
" Hail to the chief who in triumph advances." 

" See, flashing at each sturdy stroke, 
The wave ascending into smoke ; 
See the proud pipers on the bow, 
And mark the gaudy streamers flow." 



SPECIMEN. 51 



CANTO SECOND. 



On hearing a horn sound, Ellen, instead of meeting Roderick 
Dhu, darts off to meet her father, the exiled Douglas, who is 
just landing, and is accompanied by young Malcolm Graeme, 
her lover. In the evening Roderick Dhu tells of an expected 
attack by the Royal troops of King James, who has found out 
the retreat of the Douglas, and the Chief proposes marriage 
with the daughter of the Douglas, so as to unite the forces of 
the two families, — 

"To Douglas, leagued with Roderick Dhu, 
Will friends and allies flock enow. 

When the loud pipes my bridal tell, 
The Links of Forth shall hear the knell, 
The guards shall start in Stirling's porch ; 
And, when I light the nuptial torch, 
A thousand villages in flames 
Shall scare the slumbers of King James !" 

His offers for love and war are declined, and the Douglas, in 
the present time of trouble, proposes to retire to a cave on the 
side of Ben Venue. 

" Brave Roderick, though the tempest roar, 
It may but thunder and pass o'er; 
Nor will I here remain an hour, 
To draw the lightning on thy bower." 

As could be expected, a jealous quarrel is now made by 
Roderick with the Graeme, — 

" Eager as greyhound on his game, 

Fiercely with Roderick grappled Graeme ; " 

but now the Douglas intervened, — 

"And thrust between the struggling foes 
His giant strength : — ■ Chieftains, forego ! 
I hold the first who strikes, my foe." 

With a last word of defiance addressed to Roderick, the 
Graeme now leaves the island, and declining the service even 
of a boat, jumps into the water and swims to the shore in the 
moonlight. 



LOCH KATRINE 53 



ascent of Ben Venue can be made from this Pass, taking the 
course of the mountain stream. The southern side is well 
wooded. Glasahoile Farm and stream are passed. The wood 
is named Coille Mhor (the " Great Wood.") In the background 
is Druim nan Cam, 1495 ^ eet - On the shore the pier and 
aqueduct of the Glasgow Waterworks will be noticed. These 
works were opened by Her Majesty the Queen on the 14th 
October, 1859. The water is conveyed to the capital of the 
west, a distance of 34 miles. The expense of this great 
undertaking was ^630,000. Nearing Stronachlachar we notice 
on the left the sharp peak of Ben Lomond rising above the 
nearer hills, straight ahead is Maol-Mor, 2249 feet, and to the 
right there is a fine view of Glengyle. 

Stronachlachar is now reached. The hotel is a 
comfortable house and is very convenient for boating and trout 
fishing. The fishing lasts from May till July, the trout being 
plentiful, and of good size. Above Stronachlachar the loch 
extends to about 2 miles ; a few islands are on its western side, 
the largest being named the " Black Island." 

At Portnellan, about a mile from the hotel, across the loch, 
is the old graveyard of the Clan Gregor. It is near tie water's 
edge, and held in much veneration by the clan. On the lintel 
of the doorway is a shield with the arms of the clan, a pine tree 
with a glaive, surmounted by a crown, with this motto, " Een 
Do; and Spare Not." A number of old grave-stones, with 
dates 1624-17 79, are also to be seen. It is possible this old 
churchyard may be submerged when the water of the loch is 
raised, in connection with the Glasgow Corporation waterworks 
extension, but every effort will be made by the clan to preserve 
the sacred spot. 



54 INVERSNAID TO HEAD OF LOCH LOMOND. 

BY COACH, LOCH KATRINE TO LOCH LOMOND (4 Miles). 

The coaches are in waiting on the pier in front of the hotel tc 
convey tourists to Inversnaid, on Loch Lomond, a distance 
five miles. The pedestrian, by leaving promptly, will be in tin 
for the boat. About half-a-mile from Stronachlachar, on th 
Loch Lomond road, Loch Arklet is passed on the left. Arkle 
water runs out of it, receiving several hill streams, and forming 
the beautiful Falls of Inversnaid, the final leap of which is 
about 30 feet in depth. The valley is called Glen Arklet. 
The first mountain on the right is Maol-Mor, 2249 feet; and 
the second Stoban Fhainne, 2144 feet. The old Hill Fort of 
Inversnaid, now converted into a farm steading, is passed 
when nearing Inversnaid. This fort was erected in 17 13 as a 
check or barrier against the Highlanders and the bold cateran, 
Rob Roy. General Wolfe, who fell so gloriously on the heights 
of Abraham, in America, when a young officer, commanded 
this Highland fort. The road descends rapidly to Inversnaid ; 
on the left the Arklet water rushes wildly down, forming lovely 
cascades and pools. The view of Loch Lomond from behind 
the hotel, with the mountains beyond — Crois, 2785 ; Ben Ime, 
3318; Ben Vane, 3004; and Ben Vorlich, 3092 feet — closing 
in the horizon, forms a picture of great beauty. Inver- 
snaid Hotel — a first-class house, which has been enlarged, 
giving every modern convenience — is conveniently situated for 
excursions by steamer, and for fishing in the loch. In the 
grounds are the celebrated Falls Of Inversnaid, and 
there is time to see them before the arrival of the steamer. 
There is a ferry from Inversnaid to Inveruglas, where the 
Inveruglas water falls into the loch. Wallace Isle and Inver- 
uglas Isle and ruined Castle are near the opposite shore, and a 
road leads up Inveruglas Glen to Loch Sloy, the distance being 
about two miles. " Loch Sluagh " is the war-cry of the Clan 
Macfarlane. The new West Highland Railway passes along the 
opposite shore.

INVERSNAID TO HEAD OF LOCH LOMOND. 

The tour can now be continued by taking the steamer to the 
head of the Loch, or down the Loch to Luss and the south. 

From Inversnaid to the head of the Loch is about five miles, 
and a mile from Inversnaid, on the right, Rob Roy's cave is to be 
seen. The cave is said to have been occupied by King Robert 
Bruce before his fight with the M'Dougals of Lorn. About a 
mile further on is the small island Eilan Vow, on which are the 
ruins of an old fort. The Clan Macfarlane occupied this 
district in days of old. On the left side of the loch is the 
Pulpit Rock, so called from its being occasionally used in 
summer for open-air preaching by the parish minister, whose 
flock is scattered among the glens. Ben Vorlich rears his head 
on the left, and about a mile onwards is Ardlui Pier and 
Hotel, the place of disembarkation. This hotel is conveniently 
situated for tourists and anglers, the river Falloch being close 
at hand. Ardlui is a station on the West Highland Railway, 
and any district on this line from Glasgow to Fort-William can 
be reached in a few hours. The next station further north is 
Crianlarich, the junction for joining the Callander and Oban 
Railway. The walk, drive, or going by the railway up Glen 
Falloch from Ardlui to Crianlarich (8 miles) is very enjoyable, 
as the excursion is made in sight of the beautiful streams and 
pools of the river Falloch. There is a good road all along the 
" Bonny, bonny banks of Loch Lomond " from Ardlui to Tar- 
bet, Luss, and Balloch. A good service of trains and steamers 
runs to and from Ardlui, and coaches run to Crianlarich Railway 
Station, on the Oban line, the distance being 8 miles. 
Skirting the banks of the Falloch water, a fine fall is seen near 
Inveraran. 

INVERSNAID TO BALLOCH (THE FOOT OF THE LOCH). 

After leaving the pier, on the opposite bhore is Wallace Isle, 
and Inveruglas Glen and water. Passing Kenmore Wood, 5 
miles from Inversnaid is Tarbet Pier and Hotel, a large and 
well-appointed house. Tarbet is also the pier for leaving for 
Arrochar and Loch Long, the distance between the two places 
being only about two miles. Tarbet is a good place for loch 
fishing. Numerous excursions can be made from Tarbet, and 
there are a number of coaching tours to Loch Long, Loch Fyne, 
Loch Awe, and Inveraray.

little of carrying off a lowland laird to any of his strongholds 
and keeping him secure till a good ransom was paid. Tarbet

Two miles onwards is Ro war den nan Pier and Hotel, 
the landing-place for those who wish to ascend Ben Lomond. 
A short walk leads to the hotel, a house of the old style, which 
has seen a good many winters' snows. A few venerable trees 
throw their leafy arms over it, and beautiful walks lead along 
the shore by Ptarmigan Lodge. The hotel is considered a 
good fishing station, and boats and boatmen, with all information 
as to tackle, can be had. The loch here is half-a-mile broad, 
and there is a ferry to Glen Douglas, on the opposite shore, 
Douglas Water, and Inverbeg Inn. The botanist will find in 
the neighbourhood a wide field for research. The hills in

August are clad with purple heather, and the air is perfumed 
with the sweet smell of the bog myrtle. 

" O the bonny blooming heather ! what nameless charms it hath, 
As it spreads for miles around me on my lonely mountain path ; 
The hills, and dells, and knowes are clad in purple sheen, 
And, far away beneath the pines, what a sea of glossy green ! " 

Ben Lomond is on the lands of the Duke of Montrose. It is 
3192 feet in height, and chiefly composed of granite with 
quartz which gives it a sparkling appearance, and in many

places looks like patches of snow. Mica schistous rock 
exists largely at the base of the mountain. The distance to the 
summit is about 4 miles, and the time occupied in the ascent, 
with ponies, about two hours. Ponies and guides can be had 
at the hotel. The Ordnance Survey have built cairns of stones 
on the road leading to the summit. The view from the top of 
the mountain, if the sky is clear, is of the grandest description, 
embracing the greater part of Scotland. To the north are seen 
The Cobbler, Ben Ime, Ben Cruachan, Ben Lui, Ben More, 



62 LUSS— BALMAHA. 



and Ben Lawers; to the east, Loch Ard, Ben Venue, and Ben 
Ledi. In the distance are seen the Castles of Stirling and 
Edinburgh, the islands of Bute and Arran, and the mountains 
in the north of Ireland — a noble panorama of mountain, lake, 
and sea. The river Forth rises on the north side of Ben 
Lomond. Two non-commissioned officers, stationed in Stirling 
Castle, ascended to the top of Ben Lomond, from Rowar- 
dennan Pier, in t hour and 55 minutes, descending in 1 hour 
and 5 minutes. This, however, was very good work, but for 
every-day tourists about double the length of time will be 
required. To those who are desirous of ascending the Ben, 
we would say not to go with empty pockets, as the Highland 
air sharpens the appetite considerably. The loch now widens 
rapidly and the island portion of it is entered upon. 

The village of LlISS is seen on the right, beautifully situated 
in Luss Bay, at the entrance to Glen Luss, and at a short 
distance, are the famous Camstradden Slate Quarries. Luss 
water falls into the loch at the village. Luss is much frequented 
by visitors in summer. From Strone Hill, a height behind the 
village, there is an extensive view of the lake and its islands. 
After leaving Luss the steamer steers for the opposite shore, 
passing on the left Inch-Lonaig (the "Isle of Yew Trees"), 
where Scottish bows were cut in the brave days of old. On 
the right is the isle Inch-Tavannach, or the " Monk's Isle." It 
is three-quarters of a mile long, and nearly half-a-mile broad, 
and contains about 150 acres. The second isle is Inch-Conn- 
nchan, and behind lies Inch-Moin ("Peat or Moss Isle"). 
We now pass on the right the small Isle of Buc-Inch and Inch- 
Ruim or "Round Isle," and then Inch-Fad or "Long Island," 
and Inch-Caillioch (the " Isle of Old Women "). Old ruins 
and a burying-place are on this island. 

"The shafts and limbs were rods of yew, 
Whose parents in Inch-Cailliach wave 
Their shadows o'er Clan-Alpine's grave, 
And, answering Lomond's breezes deep, 
Soothe many a chieftain's endless sleep." 

Close at hand is Balm aha Pier and Pass of Balmaha 
— a pass of some note in the days of the clans. Conic Hill 
rises in the background to the height of 11 75 feet. After 
leaving the pier, on the left is the isle of Clair-Inch. On the 
right is Torr-Inch, and Cre-Inch, and lastly the large island, 



U BALLOCH. 



Inch-Murrin, a deer forest of His Grace the Duke of Montrose. 
The mansion of his grace, Buchanan Castle, lies about two 
miles inland from the Pier of Balmaha. The loch now narrows, 
and the archipelago of islands is left, with regret, reposing on 
the silvery bosom of the loch. The mansions on the left shore 
are Ross Priory, Buchanan Castle, and Boturich Castle. On 
the right side are Rossdhu House, the seat of Sir James Colqu- 
houn of Luss, and adjoining is the tower of the old castle, the 
old seat of the Colquhouns ; also Ross Park, Arden, and 
Auchinheglish. Near at hand are Balloch Castle, Tullichewan 
Castle, and Cameron House. Before leaving the steamer at 
Balloch Pier, we may remark that Eugenie, late Empress of the 
French, presented a handsome vase of Sevres china for each 
steamer, in recognition of the attention shown to her when a 
tourist on Loch Lomond. These interesting mementoes will 
attract attention in the cabins. The river Leven flows out of 
the loch, and meanders through the Yale of Leven, joining the 
river Clyde at Dumbarton. Near the Suspension Bridge is 
Balloch Hotel, from which excursions to the scenery around 
can be made, and boats had for fishing on the loch. The 
pleasure grounds of Sir James Colquhoun and William Camp- 
bell, Esq. of Tullichewan, are open to visitors staying at the 
hotel. A splendid view of the loch is obtained from Mount 
Misery. The railway cars are in waiting to convey tourists to 
the ancient town of Stirling (by Forth and Clyde Railway) ; to 
Glasgow by the Vale of Leven, Dumbarton, and the Clyde ; or 
to the many watering-places of the west coast.

THE SAIL ON LOCH LOMOND (OR LAKE 
OF ISLANDS). 

gfc^f For description of Loch Lomond f&gt;om Invkrsnaid to Balloch, see page 59. 

The train proceeds to the pier, where the steamer is in 
waiting to convey the tourist over the Queen of Scottish Lochs. 
The steamers are of a very superior class, built expressly for the 
comfort of passengers, and afford every facility for seeing the 
beauties of the scenery. 

Loch Lomond is nearly 23 miles in length, and is from 
4 to 5 miles broad at the south end ; the surface measurement 
is nearly 20,000 acres. It is of great depth : at Luss, towards 
the south, it is about 100 feet, and to the north of Luss from 400 
to 500 feet. From the steamer threading its way among the 
islands, and calling at the various ports, the sail to the head of the 
loch extends to 30 miles. The beauty of the lower or south end 
of the loch is truly grand. Any description fails to do it justice. 
It is gemmed with mumerous lovely islands, covered with birch 
and clothed with heath to the water's edge. The water is so 
clear that the eye sees many fathoms down, while all around, 
the noble mountain ranges serve to frame in a picture of won- 
drous beauty, which for long will form a pleasant recollection 
in the mind of the beholder. 

After leaving Balloch pier, on the right Balloch Castle is 
seen, and about a mile onwards is the Castle of Boturich. 
After passing the island of Inch-Murrin is Ross Priory, a 
favourite summer retreat of Sir Walter Scott. The fine mansion 
of the Duke of Montrose, Buchanan Castle, will be observed 
among stately trees. The River Endrick runs through the 
policies, and falls into Loch Lomond. Inch-Murrin, the first 
of the islands, is the largest, being nearly 4 miles in circumfer- 
ence, and is used as a deer park by the Duke of Montrose. 
On the island are the ruins of Lennox Castle, where the Duchess 
of Albany resided in her cruel widowhood, her husband, father, 
and two sons having fallen under the headsman's axe on the 
Gowling Hills at Stirling in 1424. On the left shore, about a 
mile from the pier, is Cameron House, the seat of the late Alex. 
Smollett, M.P. for Dumbartonshire, descendant of the cele- 
brated historian and author, Tobias Smollett, Esq. 

A short distance onwards on the left are the mansions of 
Belretiro, Auchinheglish, and Arden, beautifully and roman- 

See map, pages 68 and 69.

tically situated amid fine lawns and woods. About 4 miles! 
from Arden, to the west, is Glen Fruin (the Glen of Wailing), ; 
where a bloody fight took place between the Colquhouns and; 
the MacGregors in the year 1622. Beyond the island of Inch- 
Murrin are the small islands of Cre-Inch, Torr-Inch, and Clair- 
Inch, the latter about half a mile in length. The island of Torr- 
Inch is passed on the right, and also the small island of Aber ; 
while to the left is Inch-Caillioch (or the Island of Old 
Women), so called from a nunnery which existed there at an 
early period. Some old ruins still remain. This island is well 
wooded, and is used as a place of interment by the clans. 

The steamer now steers for Balm ah a Pier. The Pass 
of Balmaha is referred to in Scott's Lady of the Lake^ and in 
the days of Rob Roy swords were often crossed at this pass. 
Conic Hill rises in the background to the height of 1175 feet. 

The steamer, after leaving Balmaha, steers for the opposite 
shore. Threading its way among the islands, the first in order 
is Inch-Fad (the Long Island). It is nearly a mile in length, 
and is well wooded. The next is Inch-Ruim (or the Round 
Island), then the small island of Buc-Inch, and to the south of 
it is Inch-Moan (the Peat Island). The latter lies low and flat, 
and abounds in peat moss, which is largely used for fuel in the 
Highlands. The next island is Inch-Tavannach (the Monks' 
Island), so called from its having been the site of a monastery. 
A good view of the lake is to be had from the heights. One 
family resides on the island. r rhe rocky knoll is Tannacleg (the 
Bell Light). The island is e mile in length. Inch-Connachan 
is separated from Inch-Tavannach by a narrow strait. 

The steamer rounds the head of the next island, Inch- 
Connachan (Colquhoun's Island). The island to the right, the 
last of the group, is Inch-Lonaig (the Yew Island), which 
derives its name from the number of yew trees growing on it. 
In early days, it is said, the Scottish army got their bows here. 
It is the property of Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, and is now 
used as a deer park. On the Luss side is Ross-Dhu House, 
the noble mansion of Sir James Colquhoun, Lord-Lieutenant 
of Dumbartonshire. It is situated on a fine lawn and pebbly 
shore, with pine-clad hills in the background. 

A melancholy boat accident occurred near Luss on the 18th 
December, 1873, Sir James Colquhoun, Bart., three of his 
gamekeepers, and a kennel boy being drowned by the swamping 
of a boat while returning from the island of Inch-Lonaig. The 














'if-

island has been a deer park for a long period, and a fine fores 
of old yew trees gives shelter to the herd, numbering about 150 

We now approach LUSS, the steering requiring great care, 
owing to the number of rocks in the bay. Luss is a most' 
beautiful retreat, and good hotel accommodation and lodgings 
may be had in the village. It is situated at the entrance to: 
Glen Luss, the Water of Luss falling into the loch near the 
village. Luss is a favourite resort for anglers. A beautiful 
view of the loch with its many islands may be had from the 
heights behind the village. The hill behind Camstradden 
House is called Cruach-Dhubh, and rises to the height of 11 54 
feet. A good road skirts the loch from Luss to Inverbeg Inn, 
wnere the River Douglas falls into the loch. Glen Douglas, 
close at hand, is well worth a visit. 

The steamer proceeds to Rowardennan, on the 
opposite shore — the landing-place for tourists who intend 
to ascend Ben Lomond, in height 3192 feet. An excellent 
hotel is here, where guides and ponies are supplied. Ben 
Lomond is the property of the Duke of Montrose. The ascent, 
with proper care, is not difficult or dangerous, the distance to 
the top being about 4 miles, and taking about two hours to ac- 
complish. The view from the summit is of the grandest descrip- 
tion, and embraces scenery of loch and mountain, stretching 
from the Firth of Forth on the east to the heights of Arran on 
the west. After leaving Rowardennan, is Rowardennan Lodge. 
On the opposite side is Inverbeg Inn, where the ferry crosses. 
The Point of Firkin is passed, and about three miles onwards 
is Rob Roy's Prison, where the bold freebooter found shelter, 
and where he confined refractory subjects who came into his 
power. On the opposite shore is Stuckgown House, long the 
summer residence of the late Lord Jeffrey, the celebrated critic 
and editor of the Edinburgh Review. About a mile onward is 
Tarbet, the place for tourists leaving for Arrochar, head of 
Loch Long, Inveraray, &amp;c. Tarbet Hotel is a large, first-class 
house. One of the grandest views of Ben Lomond is had from 
here. Ben Arthur, "The Cobbler," is seen towards the west. 
Excursions can be made by boat to many places of interest 
on the loch, and to the other side for the ascent of Ben Lomond. 
A pleasant walk of 2 miles leads to Arrochar, where the 
Loch Long steamer is to be had for Glasgow. Coaches run in 
the season from Tarbet Hotel for Arrochar, Glencroe, Inveraray, 
arid Dalmally. At this point the West Highland Railway from 



SAIL ON LOCH LOMOND. 



Glasgow touches the loch side, passing to the head of the loch, 
to Crianlarich and Fort William. Leaving Tarbet, on the left 
is the Small Isle, Tarbet Isle, the Wood of Kenmore, and the 
finely situated house of Blarannich. 

The steamer now steers for the opposite shore, and 5 miles 
from Tarbet is Inversnaid, the landing-place for Loch 
Katrine and the Trossachs. The hotel is a first-class one, and 
has recently had large additions made to it. Coaches convey 
tourists to Loch Katrine, a distance of about 5 miles. The 
River Arklet falls into the loch near the hotel, and forms the 
well-known Falls of Inversnaid. On the opposite shore is 
Inveruglas Isle, on which are old ruins. The water of Inveru- 
glas rises in Loch Sloy, flows through the sterile glen of 
Inveruglas, and falls into Loch Lomond at this place. The dis- 
tance to Loch Sloy is about 3 miles. Information as to fishing 
can be got at the hotel. The Clan Macfarlane adopted " Loch 
Sloy" as their battle-cry. In the background a grand view 
of mountains is seen. To the right is Ben Voirlich, 3092 feet, 
next Ben Vane, 3004 feet, and Ben Ime furthest distant, 3318 
feet. The near hill on the left is Crois, a spur of Ben Arthur. 
The latter derives its name, " The Cobbler," from the appear- 
ance it assumes from the east of a shoemaker or cobbler at 
work. From Inversnaid to the head of loch, see page 59. 







72 CALLANDER TO OBAN, WITH BRANCH TOURS. 

CJILLJLNDHR. TO OBJIJi 

JJ~gJ^ Note. — Branch tours are marked thus IT 

On leaving Callander, the first object to interest the traveller 
is the Leny River, and where the Leny unites with the Teith 
the ancient burying place of the Clan Buchanan will be noticed. 
On the right, beautifully situated, is Leny House, the seat of 
John Buchanan Hamilton, Esq. The railway now enters the 
Pass of Leny amid a profusion of rocks, boulders, and wild 
flowers ; and skirts the Leny river, which it crosses twice near 
the base of Ben Ledi. The course of the river is rough and 
wild, with many rapids and several waterfalls, almost hid from 
view by the overhanging trees. Loch Lubnaig now bursts 
upon the view. The Chapel of St. Bride stood near the foot 
of the loch, on the right hand side. The old burying-place of 
St. Bride, still used by the Clan MacKinlay, will be noticed. 
Sir Walter Scott, in the Lady of the Lake (Canto in., xx. xxi.), 
introduces the touching scene of the interrupted marriage at 
the Chapel of St. Bride, where the sign of the Fiery Cross was 
taken from the hands of Angus by Norman at the churchyard, 
gate. The train skirts the margin of the loch, which is about 
four miles long and one mile in breadth. This is a most 
pleasing portion of the route. The noble Ben Ledi rises 
steeply on the left, and the placid loch is on the right, with here 
and there a boat, and the angler pursuing the gentle art. 
About half-way up the loch, on the opposite side, is Ardchulary 
farm-house, at one time occupied by James Bruce, F.R.S., the 
celebrated Abyssinian traveller and explorer of Africa and the 
sources of the Nile. Near the head of the loch the railway 
passes over the site of Laggan* old farm-house, from which 
house, it is said, Rob Roy carried off Helen MacGregor to 
make her his wife. Passing Ruinacraig farm-house, the head 
of the loch is reached, and crossing the Balvaig river, which 
feeds the loch, Strathyre station is entered. A monument has 
been erected at Strathyre railway station to the memory of 
Dugald Buchanan, the Christian Gaelic poet. It takes the 
form of a drinking fountain, and on the stone panels verses in 
Gaelic and English from his writings are inscribed as follows : — 

* The train stops on going north, by notice being given to the Guard When returning,. 
Walk to Strathyre [\\ miles) 



STRATHYRE— KING'S HOUSE. 73 

U Ni 'bheil aon neach o thrioblaid saor 
Am measg a' chinne daoin' air fad ; 
'S co lionmhor osna th'aig an righ 
5 Us th'aig an neach is isle staid." 

TRANSLATION. 

" And from among the sons of men 

There is not one from trouble free ; 
As often sighs the crowned king 
As does the man of low degree." 

Buchanan was born in Balquhidder, and died June 15th, 1768, 
aged 52 years. 

The village of St rat hy re, 9 miles from Callander, is close 
to the railway station, on the banks of Balvaig river. Several 
new houses have been built for summer quarters, and in all 
likelihood more will follow, as the railway has brought every 
comfort to the doors. There are two comfortable inns in 
Strathyre. 

" Ben Ledi saw the Cross of Fire, 

It glanced like lightning up Strath-Ire. 

O'er dale and hill the summons flew, 

Nor rest nor pause young Angus knew." 

f King's House (for Balquhidder), 2*4 miles onward, 
where the train will stop if notice is given to the guard, derives 
its name from a large Government store being built here at the 
time the great Highland roads were being made by General 
Wade. Excursions are made from here to the Braes of Bal- 
quhidder, about 2\ miles distant. The beautiful song, by 
Tannahill, "The Braes of Balquhidder," will occur to the 
reader : — 

n Let us go, lassie, go to the braes of Balquhidder, 

Where the blaeberries grow 'many the bonnie Highland heather, 
Where the deer and the roe lightly bounding together 
Sport the lang simmer day on the braes of Balquhidder." 

The ivy-covered ruins of the old Church of Balquhidder are 
most picturesque, standing on a rising ground beside the 
mountain stream. The cots of Balquhidder are rustic and 
primitive, having low walls and sod and ling-covered roofs. In 
the churchyard will be noticed the old slab or gravestone, with 
rudely-carved emblems, that covers the grave of Rob Roy. 
The broadsword shows the character of the sleeper beneath. 
The novel of Rob Roy, by Scott, records the adventures : of this

Highland reiver, and there is an interesting memoir by 
MacLeay, and a smaller one by A. H. Miller, lately published, 
giving the facts of his adventurous career. He lived to an old 
age. The Caledonian Mercury, 9th January, 1735, na&lt; ^ tne 
following: — "On Saturday night, December 28th, 1734, died 
at Balquhidder, Perthshire, the famous Highland partisan, Rob 
Roy MacGregor. Rob, on his death-bed, was visited by a 
former chief with whom he had a quarrel. His visitor was 
kept waiting till Rob was dressed in his Highland garb and his 
broadsword beside him. After the interview he was laid in his 
bed. "Now," said he, " all is over ; let the piper play, ' Cha till, 
cha till, cha till mi tuille ' ('I'll return, I'll return, I'll return no 
more'). " He is said to have expired before the dirge was finished. 

The neat Gothic church, beautifully situated near the bridge 
over Balvaig river, was erected by David Carnegie, Esq. of 
Stronvar. The trout fishing on Loch Voil and Loch Doine is 
very good, but permission must be obtained from Mr. Carnegie. 
The Balvaig water is the feeder of Loch Lubnaig, and affords 
trout fishing. It will be seen at various points of the journey. 
The whole journey is extremely beautiful, nature being seen in 
her grandest and simplest forms. 

King's House Inn will supply the tourist's wants, and any 
information as to routes will be given. On leaving King's 
House, a very large embankment is passed, and the mansion 
of Edinchip (Lady Helen MacGregor of MacGregor) is on the 
left. A noble ravine is spanned here by a lofty viaduct, and 
the railway runs, as it were, on a ledge of the mountain many 
hundred feet above the glen. 

Loch earn head station is now entered. This is the 
station for Loch Earn. A coach is in waiting. The Lochearn- 
head Hotel is a first-class house. It is beautifully situated at the 
head of the loch, about two miles from the railway station, and 
commands a magnificent view of the loch and the fine moun- 
tain scenery. Her Majesty Queen Victoria visited Lochearn- 
head on her Scottish tour to the lakes, and honoured the lessee 
of the hotel by resting and taking lunch in the house. Loch- 
earnhead is surrounded by many places of great historical 
interest, and is good headquarters for boating and fishing. 
The rural cots at the loch side are neat and picturesque in 
appearance, while the Free Church and Manse are beautifully 
situated at the entrance to the village. A very neat Episcopal 
Chapel has recently been built further south, a short distance 



LOCHEARNHEAD— ST. FILLANS. 75 

from the hotel on the station road. About i mile from the 
village, on the right hand side of the loch, is Edinample Castle. 
In the grounds the Ample burn forms a fine waterfall, more 
especially if the burn is in flood. Another mile onward is Glen 
Voirlich and Ardvoirlich House. Ben Voirlich rises to the 
height of 3224 feet, and its neighbour Stuc-a-chroin, to the 
height of 3189 feet. There is a good road on each side of the 
loch, the circuit of which is about 16 miles. It is rather 
singular that old St. Blane's Chapel (ruins) is at the Loch- 
earnhead end of the loch and St. Fillian's at the east end. 
Advoirlich House is introduced by Sir Walter Scott in the 
Legend of Montrose, a tale of the reign of James IV. The 
Stewarts of Ardvoirlich are a very old family, and played a 
prominent part in the 17th century during the wars of Montrose. 



c i" LOCHEARNHEAD TO COMRIE (15 MILES), AND TO CRIEFF (21 MILES). 

This is called the Circular Tour, and can be done from Stirling or Bridge 
of Allan and back in one day. A coach runs in the tourist season from 
Lochearnhead to Crieff, skirting the whole length of Loch Earn on its 
northern side. The beautiful mountain scenery is greatly admired, the 
lower portion being well wooded. The loch is about seven miles in length. 
At the eastern end of the loch is the beautiful village of St. Fillans, 
where there is a first-class hotel, "The Drummond Arms," long and 
favourably known. Excellent fishing can be had in the vicinity, the river 
Earn flowing out of the loch. A small wooded island, called Neish Island, 
has a tragic story connected with it of a fierce feud between the Clan Neish 
and the MacNabs. The Neishes thought themselves safe on the island, but 
the MacNabs carried a boat from Loch Tay. The old MacNab had several 
stalwart sons, whom he urged to pay oft an old score of long standing. 
Looking out one night, he said to them, " Bi 'n oidhche 'n oidhche nam 
b'iad, na gillean na gillean " — that is, "The night is the night, if the lads 
were the lads." Taking the hint, they carried out the bloody tragedy, and, 
on returning, showed the grim heads of the Neishes, when the old MacNab 
said, " Ay, the night was the night, and the lads were the lads." Only one 
of the Neishes escaped. St. Fillan was a saint of the sixth century, who 
died near Comrie in 1649. lie was the patron saint of the great King 
Robert Bruce, and the crozier of St. Fillan, now in the National Museum 
of Antiquaries in Edinburgh, was borne aloft at the Battle of Bannockburn. 
The Well of St Fillan was resorted to in early ages for the cures it was 
supposed to effect. Sir Walter Scott writes — 

" Harp of the North ! that mouldering long has hung 
On the witch-elm that shades St. Fillan's spring." 

Birran or Dundurn Hill rises to the south to the height of 201 1 feet. The 
village is a delightful retreat in the summer months, and the Highland 
games held here were among the first introduced. It has many attractions, 



76 CRIEFF. 

beautiful scenery, good loch and river fishing, and is connected by 
coaches with the main lines of railway. 

A drive of 6£ miles leads to Cotnric. The road is along the Vale of the 
Earn, and passing on by Duniraand Drumlochlon Wood, Comrie is entered. 
The Royal Hotel supplies good accommodation to travellers. The river 
Earn flows through the village, and two streams — the Ruchill and the 
Lednock— fall into the Earn near the village. Comrie, many years ago, 
was visited with several shocks of earthquake. The scenery around Comrie 
is of a pleasing description : wooded hills and well-watered valleys, old 
Roman remains, glens, and waterfalls. 

Dunira House, 3 miles from Comrie, is the residence of Sir Sydney 
James Dundas, Bart. The mansion stands midway between Comrie and St. 
Fillans, among the grandest scenery of the Perthshire Highlands. A 
former proprietor, Lord Melville, who died in 181 1, was eminent as a 
statesman, and a monument is erected to his memory on Dunmore Hill, in 
the form of an obelisk, 72 feet in height. The hill is 800 feet in height, 
and clad with pine trees. The present mansion was erected in 1852, in the 
mixed baronial style of architecture, the stone used being from the quarries 
at Bannockburn. The plantations embrace about 1500 acres, and the 
larch and spruce trees are very fine, being nearly a century old. Many 
beautiful glens are on the estate. Glen Boltachan, to the north-west of the 
house, is very beautiful and romantic. It is richly wooded, and the walks 
and bridges show the finest parts and cascades. The roads and walks in 
the Dunira estate are nearly 35 miles in length. The Ettrick Shepherd 
(James Hogg), in "The Queen's Wake," introduces Dunira : — 

" Bonny Kilmany gaed up the glen, 
But it wasna to meet Dunira's men, 
Nor the rosy monk of the Isle to see, 
For Kilmany was pure as pure could be ; 
It was really to hear the Yorlin sing. 
And pu* the bluecress flower round the spring, 
To pu' the scarlet hypp and the hind berrye, 
And the nut that hangs frae the hazel tree." 

Glen Lednock is well worth a visit. On the Lednock burn is a waterfall 
called the Deil's Cauldron, about 2 miles from Comrie. 

In the neighbourhood are the following gentlemen's seats : — Dalchonzie, 
Aberuchill, and Comrie House. The census of 1891 gives the population 
of Comrie as 870. 

Crieff is distant 7 miles from Comrie, and is reached by coach. The 
northern side of the road is hilly and well wooded ; on the south is the 
beautiful valley of the Earn ; on the right the mansions of Tomperran, 
Lawers, and Clathick. Lawers House is 2\ miles from Comrie, and is the 
seat of Colonel Williamson. A beautiful view may be had from the house, 
embracing Ben Voirlich, and the Forest of Glenartney, the old deer forest 
of the Scottish Kings. In 1842, Prince Albert spent a day deer-hunting in 
Glenartney. Lawers estate is very extensive, covering nearly 5a miles of 
country. In the policies are many noble trees, particularly Scotch firs. In 
the grounds there is a very old ruined chapel, surrounded with a fine grove 
of dark sepulchral yews, the old ruins being associated with scenes of 
Flighland feud and tragedy. After passing Monzievaird Parish Church 
and manse, about a mile to the east is the mansion of Ochtertyre, the 
residence of Sir Patrick Keith Murray, the family dating back to the tenth 
century. ' Sir Walter : Scott, in the Legend of Montrose, gives a -graphic 



CRIEFF. 77 

account of a battle that took place in 151 1 between the Murrays and the 
Drummonds. In the policies is the Loch of Monzievaird, and ah old tower. 
In 1787, the Ayrshire bard, Robert Burns, visited Ochtertyre as the guest 
of Sir William Murray, the fifth Baronet, and wrote the song, "Blythe 
Was She "— 

" By Ochtertyre there grows the aik, 
On Yarrow Braes the birken shaw, 
But Phemie was a bonnier lass 

Than Braes of Yarrow ever saw ; 
Blythe, blythe, and merry was she, 

Blythe was she but and ben ; 
Blythe by the banks of Earn, 
And blythe in Glenturret Glen." 

The heroine was Miss Murray of Lintrose, known as the " Flower of 
Strathmore." 

Crieff is a market town, and has a population of 4852, which is largely 
increased by visitors during the summer. It has Established, Free, United 
Presbyterian, Congregational, Episcopal, and Roman Catholic Churches, 
and a Provost, Magistrates, and Town Council. It is connected by the 
Crieff Junction line (9 miles &gt; with the Caledonian Railway, and with Perth 
by the Crieff and Methven line (18 miles). On 10th September, 1842, on 
their way from Taymouth to Drummond Castle, the Queen and Prince 
Albert passed through Crieff. The town stands on a sloping hill, with a 
southern exposure, and is protected from the north by wooded uplands, 
called the Knock of Crieff, while the valley is drained by the river Earn. 
The subsoil is of a gravelly, sandy nature, and from its altitude Crieff is dry 
and bracing. It is considered one of the healthiest towns in Scotland. There 
is a large Hydropathic Establishment, which is well patronised, and lodgings 
and furnished houses are in great request during the season. Besides the 
usual Board Schools in the town, there is an endowed educational institu- 
tion, called Morrison's Academy. A sculptured stone is pointed out as of 
considerable antiquity, and the old Town Cross, and the formidable 
instrument of iron — the jougs — are still to be seen. The jougs, in a past 
age, were a terror to evil-doers. Crieff suffered by the rebels in 1715, and 
also in 1745. Prince Charlie, with his Highlanders, lay a night in Crieff, 
the Prince sleeping at Ferntower. 

Crieff is surrounded with fine estates, and the proprietors kindly grant 
permission to strangers to visit their grounds. In the neighbourhood are 
the following : — Monzie Castle, Ferntower, Abercairney, Strowan House, 
Drummond Castle— all within a radius of 2 or 3 miles. Abercairney, the 
seat of Sir Charles Stirling Home-Drummond Moray, is three miles to the 
east of Crieff. The glen is rich in wild flowers, and has many cascades and 
two waterfalls, about 1 J miles up from the public road. Abercairney has 
been in possession of the family of Moray for five centuries, the Murrays of 
Abercairney being lineal descendants of the ancient Earls of Strathearn. 
Strowan House is 3 miles from Crieff. This house stands in the Vale of 
Strathearn, the river Earn passing through the grounds. In the policies 
are a number of large trees, and not far from the house a cross marks the 
ancient place of Strowan or St. Rowan, who lived in the seventh 
century. The old church is an interesting ivy-covered ruin, and the 
burying-place of the family. Tuslum Hill, 1260 feet in height, is a 
prominent object in the landscape, and is one of the finest wooded hills in 
Scotland. 



LOCHEARNHEAD— KILLIN. 



To the north of the Hydropathic Establishment is the road leading to 
Glen Turret. The scenery of this glen is wild, rocky, and picturesque, and 
through it flows Turret water, which rises in the loch of the same name. 
On the Turret, about two miles to the north of Crieff, and near Ochtertyre 
policies, may be seen a beautiful waterfall called Spout Hoick or Falls of 
Turret. The water falls sheer down, forming a sheet of spray, and dis- 
appears behind the rocks, appearing again in a quiet pool. The Shaggie 
burn, the Kelty burn, and the Barvick burn fall into the Turret. From the 
hilly nature of the district beautiful ravines and waterfalls prevail in all of 
them. A favourite walk is by the Comrie road to Tom-a-chastel Hill (the 
Hill of the Castle) — about 3 miles from Crieff, the view from which will 
amply repay the exertion of the walk. Lady Mary's Walk, by the banks of 
the river Earn, is another favourite. On Tom-a-chastel Hill, in 1832, was 
erected a handsome obelisk to the memory of Sir David Baird, Bart, of 
Ferntower, hero of Seringapatam. It is in the form of an obelisk, 82 feet 
in height, and built of Aberdeen granite. Unfortunately it was struck by 
lightning a number of years ago, and much shattered. 

The Circular Tour can be pleasantly carried out in one day even from 
Edinburgh or Glasgow, and easily from Stirling, Bridge of Allan, or 
Callander, and is one of the most delightful of excursions, the expense by 
rail and coach being very moderate. 

Lochearnhead Station. — Continuing the route on the 
Callander and Oban railway, shortly after leaving this station a 
magnificent bird's-eye view of Loch Earn and the fine sloping 
green hills on its banks is obtained. Soon the wild Glenogle 
is entered, where the railway runs along the mountain side, and 
many hundred feet below is the ravine of Glenogle burn. Near 
the head of the glen a large viaduct of twelve arches spans the 
ravine. Magnificent views are obtained of the glen looking to 
Lochearnhead, or in the opposite direction to the Glendochart 
Hills. Loch Larig (Eala), a small loch, is passed on the left. 
It affords fair trout fishing, and permission to fish can be had 
on application at the Lochearnhead Hotel. 

H Kill in Junction (17 miles from Callander). Here a branch 
line leads to Kill in and Loch Tay, the distance being 
about 5 miles. The line enters the valley of the Dochart, 
having the river on the left, which it crosses before entering the 
village. Passengers for Killin leave at Killin Station, while 
those for Loch Tay steamer go on to the loch, about half-a-mile 
further. 

Killin — population 500. This beautiful Highland village is 
now brought within easy access of the large cities. It is 
included within one of the most delightful circular tours in 
Scotland, viz., Killin, Loch Tay, Kenmore, Taymouth, Aber- 
feldy — and branch line to Ballinluig (24 miles from Perth) — 



KILLIN. 79 

on the Highland railway. There are three places of worship 
in Killin, the Established, Free, and Episcopal Churches. The 
Bank of Scotland and Union Bank have branches, and there is 
a Post and Telegraph Office. Many houses are let by the 
month or the season. The Killin Hotel, a large first-class 
house, is beautifully situated at the east end of the village, 
where the river Lochay falls into Loch Tay, and boats and 
boatmen are at hand either for pleasure-sailing or for fishing. 
The hotel is much frequented by anglers in the early months of 
the year for salmon-fishing, and it is necessary to write to 
secure boats. 

Killin and neighbourhood is considered very healthy, and 
many of the natives live to a good old age. One old lady 
attained to 1 12 years, and another to over 100. It is recorded 
of one, Hugh Cameron, who died in 1817, that he reached the 
great age of 1 1 5 years. 

Killin has much to interest and attract. It is beautifully 
situated, has a noble surrounding of mountains, and Loch Tay, 
one of the most charming of Scottish lakes, fills in the picture. 
The student of history has a wide field of study among the 
old ruins, and the artist has a grand variety of scenery. 
The old seat of the Clan Macnab was Kinnel House, situated 
about a mile from Killin. If the clan has faded, the Kinnel 
Vine (a black Hamburg) still thrives. It is supposed to be one 
of the largest, was planted in 1832, and fills a glass house 170 
feet long. About 2000 bunches of grapes are gathered yearly. 
Auchmore House, one of the seats of the Marquis of Breadal- 
bane, is near at hand, and one of the finest views of Killin is 
got from the hill above Auchmore. To the west is seen the 
valley of the Dochart, enclosed by Ben More and Binnein ; in 
the foreground Killin, nestling at the base of Stronachlachan ; 
while Loch Tay and the Lochay and Dochart rivers, fringed 
with trees, appear here and there glancing in the sun. In 
Killin a few of the old rustic cots still remain inhabited by hale 
old women. Behind the Free Church, in a field near is a cairn 
and stone about two feet in height, said to mark the grave of 
Fingal, the hero of Ossian and king of Morven. Near the 
hotel is the old Parish Church, said to have been erected in 
1744, beautifully shaded by a venerable plane tree, planted at 
the same time. The visitor can walk to old Finlarig Castle, 
and in the same direction is the hill of Stronachlachan, distant 
about iy 2 miles. From the top a magnificent view is got, 



80 KILLIN— LOCH TAY. 

embracing the lands of Breadalbane for 30 miles from east to 
west, and from 10 to 13 from north to south. Cairngorms are 
found at the foot of Craigchailach, and pearls in the river 
Lochay. Finlarig old ivy-covered castle is well worth a visit. 
It forms a pleasant walk of half a mile, or a boat can be taken. 
The Lochay is crossed by a bridge which leads to the castle, 
and a guide is to be had to show the grounds. Finlarig Chapel 
is the burying-place of the Breadalbane family. It dates from 
1520, and is worth visiting on account of the beauty of the 
situation and its old antiquarian associations. A holly tree is 
pointed out, said to be several hundred years old, and in girth 
8 feet 9 inches. It is on the Mote Hill, and adjoining is the 
pit for executions, where the headsman did his deadly work. 
The iron chains are still there. There is a carved headstone, 
with date 1593, said to represent Black Duncan and Lady Jane 
Stewart, his wife. A very old plane or sycamore tree (the 
Gallows Tree) at the Mote Hill is worth noting, other trees 
having rooted in the old boughs. A Highlander shows visitors 
round. Not far from Finlarig is the Bridge of Lochay Inn, 
one mile from Killin. It is one of the old Highland inns, and 
is situated at the entrance to Glen Lochay, and has boats for 
fishing on the loch. A visit to Glen Lochay should not be 
overlooked, as the glen is very attractive. Some Highland cots 
are passed on the way, and the Falls are a mile or two up the 
glen. The road has been much improved of late, and a coach 
may run in the season. A recent writer speaks of the Falls of 
the Lochay as equal to the Falls of the Tummell. 

IF Loch Tay — Killin Pier. A pleasant walk of about a 
mile leads to the loch, which is 15 miles in length. The 
steamer calls at various landing-places — Killin Pier, Ardeonaig, 
Lawers, Ardtalnaig, Fearnan, Kenmore, &amp;c., and connecting 
with the railway at Aberfeldy. The sail up the loch takes 
about one hour and a half. There are good roads on both 
sides of the loch, and hotels at Lawers and Ardeonaig, where 
loch fishing can be had. Lawers is the place for ascending 
Ben Lawers, which rises to the height of 3984 feet, and is the 
third highest mountain in Scotland, and the loftiest in Perth- 
shire. The ascent occupies about two hours. On the top is 
a cairn about 20 feet in height. The Ben is not so wild and 
rugged as many other mountains, but is rich in plants, and a 
good hunting-ground for the botanist. Many tourists ascend 
in summer, the view from the top being of the grandest 



KENMORE— KILLIN JUNCTION. 81 

description. Guides can be got at the hotel. From Fearnan 
a road of about two miles leads to Fortingall, in Glen Lyon. 
At Kenmore the Breadalbane Arms Hotel is a first-class house, 
beautifully situated. On the loch, and opposite Kenmore, is 
an island containing some old ruins, supposed to have been a 
priory, and where is interred Sibylla, a daughter of Henry I. of 
England, and the consort of Alexander I. of Scotland. 

The village of Kenmore has a good hotel, and Estab- 
lished and Free Churches. From the bridge a most extensive 
and beautiful view is got of Ben Lawers and the loch and 
valley. The principal entrance to Taymouth Castle is at Ken- 
more. The grounds are extensive and beautifully laid out, 
and the noble mansion is boldly thrown into relief by the pine- 
clad heights of Drummond Hill. A good view of the castle is 
had from the battery, where cannon are placed. The Breadal- 
bane family goes far back in Scottish history, and was connected 
with royalty in the reign of Robert II. The late Marquis 
entertained the Queen and Prince Albert on their visit to Scot- 
land in 1842 in princely style. The river Tay meanders 
through the castle grounds, giving additional beauty to the 
scene. The old castle was built in the year 1580, and the 
present castle in 1801, additions being made in 1842. Admis- 
sion is freely given to the grounds, and a guide accompanies 
parties at a fixed charge. The flower gardens are very extensive, 
and near the castle are four trees, two oaks and two Scotch 
firs, planted by the Queen and the late Prince Consort in 1842. 
To the south of these are two others, planted by the Empress 
Eugenie. A day or two can be well spent at Kenmore in walks 
or driving. The Falls of Acharn, about two miles along the 
loch, are worth seeing. They are about 80 feet in height, and 
are much enhanced if the burn is in flood. Glen Lyon and 
Fortingall are also worthy of a visit. A pleasant drive of 6 
miles by coach leads to Aberfeldy, the road being lined with 
fine trees, forming a delightful shade, while here and there are 
seen the sparkling waters of the Tay. At Aberfeldy is General 
Wade's Bridge and the Falls of Moness. Here a branch line 
runs to Ballinluing, on the Highland Railway. 

After leaving Killin Junction the railway makes a 
detour to the left, entering the valley of the River Dochart. 
A good view is got of Killin, with Loch Tay in the distance, 
and also of Ben Lawers, 3984 feet in height, and toward the 
west Ben More and Stobinain. The Dochart is a fair salmon 



32 LUIB— CR1ANLARICH. 

river from May till August, and for trout all the season. Glen 
Dochart is a fine combination of wild and pastoral scenery ; at 
the upper end it is rugged and mountainous, but mellows down 
to pastoral beauty near Killin. 

Luib station (22 miles from Callander). Luib Hotel is 
near the river Dochart, and affords good quarters for anglers, 
several salmon pools being close at hand, and all necessary in- 
formation can be had at the hotel. 

Ben More, or the Great Hill, is seen to the south (3845 feet 
in height), and Stobinain, 3821 feet. After leaving Luib, Suie 
House is passed, and the railway skirts the banks of the River 
Dochart. Loch Nubhair now appears in view. It is about 
i£ miles in length. Salmon, trout, and pike are found in the 
loch. The scenery is very beautiful. Loch Dochart House is 
at the east end of the loch. A short distance onwards, and 
connected with Loch Nubhair, is Loch Dochart, where good 
fishing is obtained. Near the middle, on a small island, are the 
ruins of an old fort, Castle Dochart, the ancient seat of the Clan 
Campbell. The castle ruins are shaded by fine trees, and the 
whole forms a beautiful landscape. This castle gave shelter to 
King Robert Bruce after a fight with the Clan MacDougall. 
On the left are the houses of Inveronchoie, Portnellan, and 
Inverardran. 

Cria.tlla.rich station (29 miles from Callander) is now 
entered. Crianlarich Hotel is very beautifully situated at the 
head of Glenfalloch. Passengers leave here for Loch Lomond, 
a distance of about 8 miles. A coach runs from Crianlarich 
through Glenfalloch to Ardlui pier, at the head of Loch 
Lomond, where the steamer waits for passengers. Near the 

Hotel is Crianlarich New Station, on West 

Highland Railway from Glasgow to Fort-William. This line 
crosses overhead, and its course on the side of mountain on the 
opposite side of the valley is seen till we reach Tyndrum. 
Behind us Ben More and Stobinain assume very grand propor- 
tions. 

After leaving Crianlarich, the railway skirts for 3 miles the 
banks of the River Fillan — where excellent fishing is to be had 
— passing Dalrie (Dal Righ), or the King's Field, named in 
honour of the fight between King Robert Bruce and the fierce 
Clan MacDougall of Lorn, in the year 1306. The story of the 
fight is graphically told by Sir Walter Scott. The King was 
sore beset by three fierce clansmen, a father and two sons, and 



TYNDRUM— DALMALLY. 83 

it was only by great skill and valour he escaped, but he left in 
the death-grasp of one of the clan his plaid and brooch. The 
brooch is a much-prized heirloom in possession of the 
MacDougalls at their mansion at Dunolly. In the Strath is the 
site of the ancient priory of St. Fillan, founded by King Robert 
Bruce, in all likelihood out of gratitude for his deliverance. 
Not far off is the Holy Well or Pool of St. Fillan. In the early 
days saints' wells were numerous, and dovetees flocked to them 
in order to get cured of their maladies. The Ettrick Water 
falls into the Fillan near Tyndrum Lodge. The Free Church 
is passed on the right. The train now enters 

Tyndrum station (34 miles from Callander). The hotel 
is situated close to the railway station, and affords ample accom- 
modation. To the angler, Tyndrum makes good headquarters. 
The River Fillan is at hand, and Loch-Na-Bea, within walking- 
distance (i|- miles). The trout are plentiful but not large. 
About 1 \ miles from Tyndrum will be noticed the Parish 
Church and manse. It is situated on the banks of the River 
Fillan, and on the site of the old chapel, near the Holy Pool of 
St. Fillan. The old lead mines of the Marquis of Breadalbane, 
at Clifton hamlet, are in the neighbourhood, but they have not 
been worked for many years. Ben Lui rises in the south to the 
height of 3615 feet, and near this is the source of the Tay, 
the longest river in Scotland, being 126 miles in length. The 
district is wild and mountainous, and studded with hills and 
Bens. On the left is Loch-Na Bea, on the right is Ariden 
House, and onwards, on the left, Sokoch House. A glen, called 
the Wearisome Glen, speaks to the dreary nature of the country, 
but on descending the valley of the Lochay the country 
improves. Before entering Dalmally, a beautiful view is got 
of Glen Orchy and Glen Strae. We have now entered Glen 
Orchy, and several mountain streams fall into the River Orchy 
on its way to Loch Awe. 

Tyndrum New Station, on the West Highland 

Railway from Glasgow to Fort-William, is a few minutes' walk 
from the Hotel. 

Dalmally station — (a coach leaves for Inveraray) — 46 
miles from Callander. The hamlet of Dalmally is beautifully 
situated at the opening of several glens. The hotel affords good 
accommodation to tourists and anglers. A few large old Scotch 
fir trees deserve notice, and several Highland shielings will 
delight the artist. A number of new houses have been erected 



84 LOCH AWE. 



to meet the wants of visitors. Salmon and trout fishing may 
be had in the Orchy, and also in Loch Awe. 

The Parish church of Glenorchy is situated on an eminence 
and surrounded with trees. Its antiquity appears from the date 
1440, with the Campbell arms, cut over the door. In the church- 
yard many of the tombstones have figures of warriors rudely 
chiselled. The broadsword is the emblem on the stones, show- 
ing the warlike character of the MacGregors, whose home was 
in Glen Orchy. Some of the stones are said to have been 
brought from Innishail on Loch Awe, and, after appropriation, 
to have had modern names added. 

Shortly after leaving Dalmally station, we see Glenstrae open- 
ing on the right. The lines of Sir Walter Scott, in 
" MacGregors' Gathering," tell a tale of the olden time — 

" Glen Orchy's proud mountains, Kilchurn and her towers, 
Glen Strae and Glen Lyon, no longer are ours ; 

We're landless, landless, landless, Grigalach ! " 

The origin of the proverb, " a Highlandman's promise," is 
worth relating, and how it occurred. In the year 1603, Alaster 
MacGregor of Glenstrae, with eighteen of his clan, had 
surrendered to the Earl of Argyle (the MacCallum Mhor), on 
the promise being made that they should be sent out of the 
country • the Earl agreed to this, and they were sent on as far 
as Berwick under a proper guard. The officer was instructed, 
however, not to let the Highlanders go, but bring them back 
again to Edinburgh. This he did, and it is recorded that the 
chief and the other clansmen were hanged at the Cross. As a 
mark of honour, Alaster was hanged his own height above the 
rest. (See notes to Sir Walter Scott's Highland Widow), A 
monument is erected near Dalmally, on the Inveraray Road, to 
Duncan Ban MTntyre, who died in 1812, at the patriarchal 
age of 89 years. He was a poet of considerable merit, one of 
his best pieces being, "The Last Farewell to the Hills." 
There is on the Glen Strae Road another to the late Duncan 
M'Laren, M.P. for Edinburgh, on the site of his birth-place. 

Loch Awe and Kilchurn Castle are next seen on the left. 
The loch is about 30 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, 
and there are 24 islands. Many of the islands are rich in old 
legendary story. Here the early Church found a quiet retreat, 
and some islands form the last resting-places of the clansmen.

the loch is the Loch Awe Hotel. The pier is close to the hotel. 
The view is grand, with the loch in the foreground, and old 
Kilchurn Castle shaded by trees, like a gem in a silver setting, 
all framed in by the mountains around. As tourists can 
break their journey at Loch Awe station, we would strongly 
recommend everyone, if they cannot have longer time, to at 
least spend a few hours here ; a day can very easily be spent, 
visiting Kilchurn Castle in the forenoon and walking along to 
the Falls of Cruachan in the afternoon. To visitors who can 
prolong their stay Loch Awe will be found most admirable 
headquarters. Angling is to be got in the River Orchy for 
salmon and trout, and boats for angling on Loch Awe. April 
to June are the best months for trout fishing. 

Kilchurn Castle dates from the 14th century, and was a 
stronghold of the Campbells of Loch Awe. At one time it was 
the residence of the Earls of Breadalbane. In 1745 it was 
garrisoned by the royal troops. On the island, Fraoch-Eilean 
(the Isle of Heather), are the ruins of an old castle of the Clan 
MacNaughtan. In 1267 this island, with its fortress, was 
granted by Alexander III. to the chief of the Clan MacNaughtan, 
on the condition of his entertaining the King whenever he 
passed that way. It is also the site of Ossian's Hesperides. 
The long flat island, Inishail (the Island of Repose), is the 
site of a monastery and chapel ; it has an ancient burying- 
place. At this point the loch divides — one arm flowing 
westwards by the Pass of Brander and the railway. 



A SAIL ON LOCH AWE. 

If the tourist has time a pleasant day can be spent on Loch 
Awe. The saloon steamers, Countess of Breadalbane, Loch 
Awe, &amp;c, sail during the tourist season at hours to suit the 
various coaches from Ford pier at the head of the loch and 
other places. The first stopping place is at Port Sonachan 
ferry and Hotel. The hotel is large, and occupies a commanding 
position. A coach starts from this hotel for the falls of Blair- 
gower, 7 miles down the lake. The second, on the opposite side, 
about \ of a mile across, is Taycreggan Hotel, which occupies a 
very picturesque site. This hotel, though not large, forms 
pleasant and comfortable holiday quarters for tourists, and especi- 
ally to those who wish to fish in the Loch, or hill lochs. A 
coach starts from the hotel, going down Glen Nant to Taynuilt, 



PASS OF AWE. 87 



a very fine glen — passing Kilchrennan Church, where is the 
tomb of the ancestor of the Argyles, the MacCallum Mhor. The 
third calling-place is Port-in-Sherrich with Inn, before touching 
which the fine ruins of Ardchonnel Castle, of the Lords of 
Loch Awe, and afterwards of the Earls of Argyle, is seen. 
Some further islands are passed before reaching Ford, where a 
coach is in waiting going either to Oban or to Ardrishaig. Ben 
Cruachan, one of the highest of the Argyleshire mountains, 
3667 feet, is seen to great advantage from various points on 
the loch. 

LOCH AWE BY RAIL TO OBAN. 

Leaving Loch Awe station, the train for Oban skirts the 
loch by the Woods of Letter and Falls of Cruachan, and 
the loch narrows into the grand and gloomy pass of Brander. 
It is about 3 miles long and then gives place to the Pass of 
Awe, where the River Awe begins. A very fine walk can be 
made from the Falls of Cruachan through the Pass of Brander 
to Taynuilt. A much finer view of Loch Awe and the 
Pass is thus had, the railway route being shut in by foliage. 
The River Awe flows out of the loch, and, after a run of 4 miles, 
falls into Loch Etive at Bunawe. It is very rapid and rocky in 
its course, but affords good sport to the angler, though rather 
difficult to fish. Piers are run out at the best salmon pools, and 
large sums are paid for fishing on the river. We may remind 
the reader that he is now in the territory of the once powerful 
Clan MacDougall. 

The Pass Of Awe gives incident to Sir Walter Scott's 
Highland Widow. In the days of the clans it was a pass of 
great importance. The hero of Scotland, Sir William Wallace, 
in 1300, passed through this defile; and in 1310, King Robert 
Bruce, with his followers, fought a severe and bloody fight with 
the MacDougalls of Lorn. It is related that the Bruce went 
into the district with great precaution, sending out ghillies to 
learn the position of the enemy for fear of an ambuscade. On 
entering the pass the King divided his small army into two 
divisions, and placed one of them, consisting of the archers and 
lighter troops, under Sir James Douglas, who got up to the 
heights, while the Bruce, with his chosen men, entered the 
defile. The Lorn men expected to crush him in the wild gorge, 
and consequently, being quite unprepared for this attack, they 
were caught between the two divisions. The men of Lorn were

defeated. The King secured the pass, marched on through 
Argyleshire, and took the Castle of DunstarTnage, near Oban. 

The Pass of Awe is one of the most striking passes in the 
Highlands. On the east side it is bounded by almost inacces- 
sible cliffs, which form the base of Ben Cruachan. The crags 
in certain places are almost perpendicular from the bed of the 
river. At the north end of the pass is the Cliff Craiganuni ; 
near to it the rocks seem split in two, forming a wild gorge, called 
the Rocks of Brander, through which the waters of Loch Awe 
rush with a furious noise over masses of granite and greenstone 
boulders. The River Awe is crossed by a bridge of three spans, 
80 feet above the river, and passing through fine scenery for 
about three miles, we arrive at Taynuilt hamlet and hotel. 

Taynuilt station (58 miles from Callander). The hotel 
is situated near the River Nant and River Awe, and is. 
well known to anglers. Coaches run through Glen Nant to 
Port Sonachan, passing some fine scenery on the Nant, the 
return being made by steamer to Loch Awe station. An easy 
ascent to the top of Ben Cruachan is made from Taynuilt. 
Leaving the station, keep along the road by the River Awe 
and the railway, and after crossing the bridge about four 
miles from the station, the climbing commences. Any one 
on the lookout for a good day's work, if the day is fine, 
cannot do better than ascend. A burn greets the sight of 
the traveller half-way up the mountain, and by its side 
many a pic-nic has taken place while the heroes of the party 
were viewing the scenery from the top of the Ben. The 
ascent can also be made from near Loch Awe Station, 
passing to the west of the Falls of Cruachan. Arrive by 
an early train in the morning, and you can catch trains either 
to Oban or Stirling same day. Near Taynuilt is the Church 
and Manse of Muckairn, and on the height near the church is. 
a rough obelisk, erected by the Lorn furnacemen, in 1805, to 
the memory of Lord Nelson. In 1757 iron smelting was. 
carried on to a considerable extent. The ore was considered 
of a fine quality, and the works gave employment to several 
hundreds of workmen. Soon after leaving Taynuilt, the train 
skirts the banks of Loch Etive, passing Lome House. On the 
northern side, reached by the Ferry, is Ardchattan House and 
the old Priory ruins, which date as far back as 1232. 
&gt; Ach-na-doich station. The steamer on Loch Etive 
starts here, and a tour can be made by sailing up Loch .Etive 






CONNEL FERRY— CASTLE OF DUNSTAFFNAGE. 89 

to Glen Etive, by coach through the Pass of Glen Coe to 
Ballachulish, where the steamer is got for Oban or Inverness. 
This forms a good circular tour. Loch Etive is an arm of the 
sea, and is nearly twenty miles in length. Its banks are well 
wooded, with numerous creeks and bays and a grand back- 
ground of mountains. 

Connel Ferry station and Hotel (station for the Falls 
of Lora and Dunstaffnage). The waters of the loch are here 
forced into a wild, rocky strait, and rush through with much 
fury and noise. If the tide is favourable, the noise and 
appearance of the falls is much increased. A glimpse of 
the Falls of Connel or Lora can be seen from the carriage 
windows. The word Connel signifies rage or fury. After 
leaving Connel Ferry, Loch Linnhe soon comes into view. 
Two miles from Connel Ferry, on the northern side, are the 
remains of an ancient Pictish Fort called in Gaelic Dunmacs- 
niochan or Beregonium. It was visited by Pennant, the 
historian, in 1770. The hill on which it stands, at the Bay of 
Lochnell or Ardmacknish Bay, is 150 feet high. Beinn Lora 
rises in the background to the height of 1007 feet. A coach 
starts from the north side of the ferry, returning by Loch 
Creran and Ardchattan Priory. 

The Castle of Dunstaffnage, 3 mil es from 

Connel Ferry, and 4^ miles from Oban, is situated on a bold 
promontory, in a beautifully picturesque situation, on the shores 
of Loch Linnhe, and near the mouth of Loch Etive. The 
walls are about 66 feet in height, and 9 feet in thickness. 
It measures 87 feet inside, and three of the round towers 
still remain. It dates from a very early period of Scottish 
history, being one of the earliest residences of the Scottish kings, 
and the ancient stronghold of the Lord of Lorn. The 
celebrated "Stone of Destiny" of Scotland, on which her kings 
were crowned, and the history of which is lost in the ages of 
antiquity, was kept within the castle. In 842, Kenneth II. 
had it removed to Scone Palace, near Perth, and Edward I., 
" Longshanks," " The Hammer of the Scots," carried it offasa 
trophy to London, and it is now a part of, or is placed under, 
the royal crowning chair of Great Britain, in the Abbey of 
Westminster. The remains of the castle show that it must 
have been a place of great strength, and possessed many advan- 
tages from its commanding situation. It is said by Pennant 
to have been founded by Ewen, a Pictish monarch, contempor-

ary with Julius Coesar. In 1307 the castle was held by 
Alexander MacDougal, Lord of Lorn, but was taken that year 
by King Robert Bruce. In 1455 it was the residence of the 
Lord of the Isles. The views around are very grand. To the 
w r est are Loch Linnhe, and the mountains of Morven and 
Appin, and looking eastward up Loch Etive, Ben Cruachan 
presents perhaps its grandest aspect. A pleasant excursion 
can be made by taking the train to Connel Ferry station, and 
walking along the shore of Loch Linnhe to DunstafTnage 
Castle, and on to Oban by road, 4^ miles, or about 6 miles in 
all. Some very old cannon are shown, one in brass, a relic of 
one of the ships of the Spanish Armada, which was wrecked off 
the coast. A keeper is in charge. Boats can be had, and a ferry- 
shortens the way. Near the castle is an old ruined Gothic 
chapel, and a very ancient place of interment. A singular echo 
is heard from a rock near the old chapel. The stones have 
curious emblems, and it is recorded that several kings of 
Scotland and many chiefs of high position lie in the kirkyard. 

Oban (71 miles from Callander), population (census 1891), 
4330, which is largely increased during summer. This burgh,

are managed by the Magistrates and Town Council, who are 
also Police Commissioners. The following denominations have 
places of worship in Oban : — The Church of Scotland (the 
Parish Church and St. Columba Parish Church), two Free 
Churches, the United Presbyterian Church, the Independent, 
Episcopal (St. John's), and Roman Catholic Churches. The 
following Banks have branches in Oban : — The Bank of Scotland,

point of attraction to tourists. It is beautifully situated on a 
crescent bay of great size, so large that the British Navy could 
ride at anchor in it. It varies in depth from 12 to 20 fathoms, 
and is protected by the island of Kerrara. This island is 
about 4 miles long, at the highest point about 1000 feet, 
and a visit to it forms a pleasant sail from Oban. It belongs 
to the MacDougalls of Dunolly, except a small portion belong- 
ing to the Marquis of Breadalbane. On the south point are 
the ruins of Glen Castle, once a stronghold of Clan JVTLean 
of Duart. King Alexander II. died on the island in 1249, of 
fever, in an expedition against Angus of Argyle and the Isles. 
Oban has many first-class hotels, and a number of lodging- 
houses, which afford ample accommodation to tourists. Several 
fine villas have been built in the suburbs, and from the heights 
behind the town a magnificent view is obtained of the bay and 
the islands of Kerrara, Lismore, Mull, and Morven. Many plea- 
sant walks exist in the neighbourhood, besides an excellent pro- 
menade walk by the shore to Dunolly, seats being conveniently 
placed for resting. 

Dunolly Castle.— This castle is supposed to be of 
Danish origin. It stands on a promontory overlooking the beauti- 
ful bay of Oban. This old castle was the stronghold of the Mac- 
Douglas of Lorn, near which the representatives of this 
ancient clan reside, and who have in their possession the 
celebrated Brooch of Lorn. Visitors are admitted on Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday, on entering their names in the visitors* 
book in the lodge. On the beach is a large conglomerate stone 
of considerable height, called the " Dog Stone." In Gaelic it 
is called Clach-a-choin, or the Dog's Pillar. It is introduced 
into the poems of Ossian as the stone where Ossian chained 
his dog Ban. Dunolly is a pleasant walk from Oban, and the 
old castle appears to great advantage from the sea beach. 
" Nothing," says Scott, in one of the notes to the Lord of the 
Is/es, " Nothing can be more wildly beautiful than Dunolly." 

Many walks lead to the heights behind Oban (from which 
there are fine views of the bay), specially the Pulpit Hill, beyond 
the Railway Station. A very pleasant trip for a day is to Dun- 
staffnage, either by road, coach, rail, or steam launch. Boats 
are to be had for hire, and carriages for excursions. Excursions 
can be made to many places of great interest by steamer and 
coach, of which full information will be found in the local time 
tables and the illustrated " Excursions from Oban," price 6d.

STIRLING TO LAKE OF MENTEITH, 
ABERFOYLE, LOCH ARD, LOCH LOMOND, 

BY FORTH AND CLYDE RAILWAY. 

After leaving Stirling Station, the railway turns to the 
left, passing the Gowling Hills, and affording a fine view of the 
Castle, going over the ground occupied by Surrey and Cressing- 
ham at the battle of Stirling Bridge, on by Kildean, and skirting 
the banks of the River Forth. On the left is the village of 
Cambusbarron, with its large woollen manufactory; also Gartur 
House, and the dark, pine-clad slopes of the Gillies' Hill. A 
mile onward is Touch House (Sir Alan Seton-Steuart, Bart.). 
The mansion is beautifully situated in Touch Glen. The hills 
in the background are the Touch and Gargunnock Hills, which 
are backed by the long range of the Fintry Hills. To the right 
are the mansions of Craigforth and Meiklewood. 

Gargunnock Station, s 3 A miles from Stirling. 

Gargunnock is a very rural hamlet. The mansion to the left is 
Gargunnock House (Colonel Stirling). The Peel of Gargun- 
nock is an old ruined fort of the days of Wallace, built to com- 
mand the passage of the Forth at the Fords of Frew. Beyond 
the village is Leckie House, where the baggage of the Pretender, 
Prince Charles Edward, was sent after the Battle of Falkirk in 
1746. 






STIRLING TO LAKE OF MENTEITH. 97 

Kippen Station, 9 miles. The village, situated on the 
rising ground to the left, has a Parish Church and Free Church, 
and public hall. The Parish Church is said to have been 
erected in 169 1. A bridge crosses the Forth, and near it are 
the Fords of Frew, greatly used as a means of crossing in early 
times, and more recently, in 1 745, by Prince Charles Stuart. 
The mansion to the left is Boquhan House (Admiral Campbell, 
R.N.), and behind is Boquhan Glen, the burn forming many 
waterfalls and cauldrons as it passes through the beautiful glen. 
The proprietor has made extensive walks, showing the beauties 
of the glen. The burn falls into the Forth at the Bridge of 
Frew. 

Port Of Menteith Station, 12^ miles. The scenery 
in the neighbourhood is much admired. On the left is Arn- 
gibbon House and glen and Garden House (James Stirling, 
Esq.). The old fort of Garden was a short distance from the 
present house. In the policies are many fine trees, the silver 
firs being noble specimens. The village of Arnprior is about a 
mile to the south. 

The tourist visiting the Lake Of Menteith leaves the 
train at Port of Menteith station, distant about 4 miles from 
the hotel at the lake. The walk from the railway station is a 
very pleasant one. By writing to the Lake of Menteith Hotel, 
conveyances can be obtained for 3, 4, or larger numbers at is. 
each. Cardross House (H. D. Erskine, Esq.) is passed on the 
right. The mansion is in the old castellated style of architecture, 
and stands in a finely wooded park of 300 acres. Cardross 
House has a very old history, dating from the days when abbot 
and monks reigned on Inchmahome. It was garrisoned by 
Cromwell in 1653 and in 1675. Passing Lochend House on 
the left, the lake is in view. The road now skirts the lake, 
passing Rednock House, and the Lake of Menteith Church and 
Hotel are reached. Boats can be had at the pier. The hills 
are heather-clad, and the fields are green down to the water's 
edge ; reeds and water lilies fringe the bays, which, like a mirror, 
reflect their shadows in the bosom of the loch ; the southern 
bank is well clad with trees, reminding one of the lakes of 
Cumberland. This fine sheet of water is from 6 to 7 miles in 
circumference ; and adding great effect to the scene are the 
islands of Inchmahome (the Isle of Rest) and Talla (the 
Earl's Isle), Inchmahome being the larger of the two, and about 
five acres in extent. On it are the ruins of a monastery. One 



STIRLING TO LAKE OF MENTEITH. 99 

historian writes that it was founded by Egbert in 825, and the 
Priory of Inchmahome by King Edgar in 1106 ; while another 
states that it was founded in 1238 by Walter Comyn, Earl of 
Menteith. The ruins of the old Priory are most interesting, an 
arch in the Gothic style of architecture especially being much 
admired. The monastery was occupied by monks of the Order 
of St. Augustine, in connection with the Abbey of Cambus- 
kenneth at Stirling. The island seems to have been used as a 
burying-place from a very early period, as the numerous carved 
stones will show. The Clan Graham inter here, and the arms 
of the various branches of the family are seen on the tombstones. 
The carved tombstone of Earl of Menteith (Walter Stewart) 
and his lady, the Countess of Menteith, deserves notice. The 
tombstone of Sir John Drummond of Drymen, son-in-law of 
this Walter Stewart, represents him in full armour with sword, 
spear, and shield. Sir John died in the year 1301. Sir 
Malcolm Drummond was an ardent supporter of King Robert 
the Bruce, and fought at the Battle of Bannockburn. 

The connection of the unfortunate Queen Mary with Inch- 
mahome gives it a romantic interest. Queen Mary's Bower or 
Garden is seen on the southern side of the island. After the 
disastrous Battle of Pinkie, near Musselburgh, in 1547, called 
Black Saturday, the little Princess was removed here from 
Stirling Castle to prevent her falling into the hands of Henry 
VIII., King of England. The queen-mother, to make her 
young daughter's home more cheerful, selected four young ladies 
of rank to be her companions, namely, Mary Beaton, niece to 
Cardinal Beaton ; Mary Fleming, daughter of Lord Fleming ; 
Mary Livingstone, daughter of Lord Livingstone ; Mary Seaton, 
daughter of Lord Seaton, and these are known as the Four 
Maries. They remained with the young Princess till 1548, 
when, accompanied by them, she left for France, the port of 
embarkation being Dumbarton. Several fine old chestnut trees 
up till recently adorned the island, but the largest of them have 
fallen ; they were supposed to have been from 300 to 400 years 
old. At the southern point is Nuns' Hill, so called from a 
walk extending from the Priory to the rising ground overlooking 
the lake. The island of Inchmahome is the property of the 
Duke of Montrose. Talla., the lesser island, was the strong- 
hold of the Earls of Menteith, and the ruins of their old castle 
can still be seen. It is covered with a luxuriant growth of 
wild plants, &amp;c. The lake affords good pike and perch fishing, 



100 ABERFOVLE AND LOCH ARD. 

and occasionally trout are caught. King James VI. visited the 
Earl of Mar at Cardross House, and enjoyed, it is said, the novel 
sport of pike fishing with geese — it might be called a tug of war. 
A baited line is attached to the leg of the goose, the bird 
paddles out on the lake, when the voracious pike soon lays hold 
of the bait. Then the fight begins, and for a time it is doubt- 
ful who wins ; but the pike, after one or two runs, gives in, and 
is landed. Pike are caught frequently as heavy as 8 and 15 lbs., 
Near the Hotel is the new Parish Church. It occupies the 
site of the old church ; the bell has been left hanging as in days 
of old, on a tree adjoining, and the manse and glebe of the 
clergyman are close at hand. The Queen visited the Lake of 
Menteith when staying at Invertrossachs in the summer of 1869 
The drive was by Bridgend and Loch Ruskie, and along the 
eastern shore of the Lake of Menteith to a point opposite 
Rednock Lodge, where one of the best views of the lake can be 
had. Her Majesty and party lunched at the side of the lake, 
and returned by the same route. 

Continuing the route on the Forth and Clyde Railway, we 
next come to Buchlyvie Station, 15^ miles, where 
passengers change for Aberfoyle and Loch Ard. Buchlyvie is 
about a mile to the south, and has Parish, Free, and United 
Presbyterian Churches, and a Bank. 



1 ABERFOYLE AND LOCH ARD. 

The branch line to Aberfoyle is about 5 miles in length, and 
passes over a tract of reclaimed land, called Flanders Moss, 
the remains of a Caledonian forest. The moss land extended 
to nearly 10,000 acres, stretching toward Stirling. The greater 
part was cut and carried off by channels of water into the 
Forth, many valuable farms being reclaimed. Several interest- 
ing Roman articles found in course of the work are now in the 
Antiquarian Museum in Edinburgh. Considerable difficulty 
was found in making the line owing to the soft nature of the 
soil. The site of the old Peel of Gartfarran (Castle of Vexation) 
is passed. It appears to have been a fort, the dimensions of 
which are fully described in Nimmo's Stirlingshire. The fort 
is situated about a mile from Gartmore (Great Fort), a quiet 
country village, pleasantly situated on the sloping hill-side, and 






ABERFOYLE AND LOCH ARD. 101 

containing a Free and Parish Church. The River Forth is 
crossed here. The woods and mansion house of Gartmore are 
passed on the left. The present Laird of Gartmore is R. B. 
Cunninghame-Graham, Esq. The village is i ^ miles from the 
station. The Avon Dhu, or Black River, the upper waters of 
the River Forth, is now crossed, aud the manse, church, and 
Clachan of Aberfbyle appear in view. The Aberfoyle new 
Parish Church is a model of neatness, and specially adapted for 
its situation. An old bridge of three arches crosses the river, and 
about a quarterof a mile onward is the old roofless Parish Church. 
About a mile from the hotel, on the Trossachs road, are the 
Aberfoyle slate quarries. The Clachan of Aberfoyle (which 
means, the Circle of Stones, an old Druidical circle), half a mile, 
stands on rising ground near the manse. At one period there 
were ten upright stones, with one in the centre, but time has 
very much altered their appearance. The Bailie's Rock and 
Tree and Rob Roy's Cave are 3 miles, and, further on, the 
mountain stream Eas Chagill falls into Loch Ard, and forms the 
beautiful Falls of Ledard, \\ miles. 

We may remind the reader that he is now in the land of the 
MacGregor, amid the scenes of many of the exploits of the bold 
outlaw, Rob Roy, and where Sir Walter Scott found the scenes 
and the characters for the novel, Rob Roy, The lessee of the 
hotel provides boats and boatmen for Loch Ard. 

Aberfoyle has a golfing green, and many circular walks and 
drives can be made in the neighbourhood. 

Aberfoyle is pleasantly situated, the River Forth passing in 
front, while Meall Ear, 1091 feet in height, is behind, and Craig 
More, 1 27 1, to the west, and since the opening of the railway, 
many neat villas have been erected. • From the Bailie Nicol 
Jarvie Hotel, a service of coaches now run to the Trossachs, 6 
miles, which road shows some fine mountain scenery. After 
making the steep ascent a view of the valley of the Forth and 
the Campsie Hills is obtained, and after a 3^ miles drive over 
the hill on the right, Loch Drunkie is seen in the valley below. 
When the descent begins to be made toward Loch Achray, one 
of the grandest views presents itself — on the left Ben Venue, 
then Loch Katrine, Ben A'an, Glen Finglass, and to the east 
Ben Ledi. The Trossachs road is joined at the west end of 
Loch Achray near the Trossachs Hotel. 

From Aberfoyle the tourist can visit the Lake of Menteith, 
which is 5 miles distant on the Callander road.

LOCH ARD. 103 



About a mile and a half past the village, at the foot of Loch 
Ard, is the Pass of Aberfoyle, where the troops of Crom- 
well were defeated by the soldiers under Graham of Duchray. 

Loch Ard is a good fishing loch, the trout being plenti- 
ful and of fair size. There are two Lochs, the upper and the 
lower, connected by a stream. The lower loch is about i mile 
in length, and not half a mile in breadth ; the upper loch is 
about two miles in length, varying from half a mile to one mile 
in breadth. A good road skirts the loch, leading to loch Chon, 
6 miles. Stronachlachar, Loch Katrine (10 miles), Inversnaid, 
Loch Lomond (15 miles), forms a pleasant tour. The pipes of 
the Glasgow Water Company, from Loch Katrine, pass through 
this district, skirting the banks of Loch Chon and Loch Ard. 
To the north-west, the peak of Ben Lomond towers in its 
grandeur to a height of 3192 feet; while to the north-east Ben 
Venue rises to 2393 feet. Loch Ard is one of the most beautiful 
of our Highland lochs, particularly at its southern end. It is 
surrounded with rocky promontories, and forms a fine subject 
for the artist. Near the head is the island Eilean Gorm ; and 
near the jetty, on the southern side, is a small island with ruins, 
called Duke Murdoch's Castle. The following gentlemen's 
seats are close to the loch : — On the north side, The Glashart ; 
mid-way, Loch Ard Lodge ; near the head of the loch, Ledard, 
Kinlochard, and Couligartan Lodge. 

Resuming our journey on the Forth and Clyde Railway, 
after passing Buchlyvie we come to Balfron Station, 
19! miles. The village of Balfron, situated on the River 
Endrick, is about ij miles from the station. Balfron is said to 
have been the birthplace of the fifth Earl of Glencairn, the 
the associate of John Knox, the Reformer. 

Gartness Station, 2 if miles. The Blane Valley 
Railway joins the Forth and Clyde at Gartness station, and 
connects with Glasgow. On the hill at Killearn, if miles 
distant, will be observed a monument in the shape of an obelisk, 
rising to the height of 103 feet, erected in 1788 to the memory 
of the celebrated Latin poet and historian, George Buchanan, 
the most learned Scotchman of the 16th century, and the pre- 
ceptor of James VI. He was born in 1506 at a small farm- 
house on the estate of Moss. Killearn station is on the direct 
line to Glasgow. The Endrick, a favourite stream for angling, 
is now passed. 

Drymen Station, 23] miles. The village is 2 miles to 



104 STIRLING TO ARDOCH AND DRUMMOND CASTLE. 

the north of the station. Buchanan Castle, the seat of the Duke 
of Montrose, about i mile onwards, is beautifully situated among 
fine woods, near to Loch Lomond. 

Kilmaronock (now Caldarvan) Station, 

26h miles. In early days of Christianity, the Culdees had a 
church here, founded by Saint Maronnan. It is referred to in 
Scott's Lady of the Lake — 

" Rather will Ellen Douglas dwell 
A votaress in Maronnan's cell." 

Ross Priory, a fine old mansion on the banks of Loch Lomond,, 
is near at hand. Sir Walter Scott resided here for some time,, 
the novel of Waverley being penned within its walls. 

Jamestown Station, 29^ miles. The Leven water, 
a beautiful stream which flows out of Loch Lomond, is now 
crossed. Smollett's " Ode to Leven Water " will convey a faint 
idea of the beauty of the valley of the Leven previous to the 
introduction of mills and machinery. 

BallOCh Station, 30 miles. Here the Glasgow, Dum- 
barton, and Vale of Leven Railway joins the Forth and Clyde 
Railway. A fine suspension bridge spans the River Leven, and 
the host of the Balloch Hotel will provide every comfort. A 
charming view of the loch and islands is obtained from the top 
of the hill Mount Misery. 



STIRLING TO ARDOCH AND DRUMMOND CASTLE. 

Taking train to Greenloaning Station, the Roman Camp 
is within 1 \ miles, on the right, just beyond Ardoch village. This, 
is one of the largest and most perfect Roman stations in the 
country, and was visited by the Queen in 1842. The Camp is 
about 1000 feet by 900 feet, and was capable of holding 20,000 
soldiers, which was about the number who fought at Mons. 
Grampius, a battle believed to have been fought near Ardoch. 
Near at hand is Ardoch House, built in 1793, and on the other 
side of the river Knaik is Braco Castle, which dates from the 
15 th century. 

Drummond Castle, about 7 miles from Ardoch 
and 3 from Crieff, is one of the seats of the Earl of Ancaster. 
It is approached by a fine avenue, and the gardens are greatly 
admired. In the old castle are to be seen many interesting 
historical relics and armour.
