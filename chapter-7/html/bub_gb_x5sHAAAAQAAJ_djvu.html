INTRODUCTION. 


The ancient history of the Highlands of Scot- 
land, when viewed in conjunction with the magni- 
ficent scenery of that country, and the peculiar 
manners and habits of the natives, has, in all ages, 
afforded subject of interesting inquiry to every phi- 
losophic mind. But it seems unnecessary, here to con- 
template a retrospective survey of those regions, at a 
period more distant than that in which the celebrated 
Journey of Johnson, and the Tour of Pennant appear- 
ed, in drawing a comparison betwixt the opinions 
then, and those now entertained by the people of 
England, in respect to Scotland. 

Before the publication of Pennant’s Tour, our 
southern neighbours regarded the north of Scotland 
as the land of barbarism and misrule ; and looked 
upon a visit to the Scottish lakes, and Highland 
districts, as little short of a journey to the source of 
the Nile ; and considered a perambulation through 
our country of Alpine wonders, as an undertaking 
not less hazardous than that of penetrating the sa- 
vage wilds of Africa. 

But, of late years, the case is altered. Pennant 
showed that the north of Scotland was no such ter- 
rific region, but contained objects of unusual gran- 
deur, capable of fascinating the most indifferent ob- 
server, and rousing his profound admiration ; and 
we now find, that the excellence of the public roads, 
—the great facilities of land carriages, — and, lat- 
terly, the very general use of steam vessels on our 
rivers and seas, particularly on the Clyde, have 
greatly diminished, if not wholly obviated, those 
obstacles which formerly rendered Scottish tours so

X INTRODUCTION. 

irksome and laborious. Those easy and pleasant 
modes of travelling, invite strangers from all coun- 
tries, to explore the innumerable beauties which 
the mountainous regions of the north disclose ; and 
they rush towards them with a degree of enthusi- 
astic ardour, no less commendable than it is ra- 
tional. 

The picturesque scenery of the Highlands and 
Western Islands j the sublime prospects of Loch 
Lomond and the Trosachs, with many other places, 
have been attempted to be delineated by the pain- 
ter, the poet, and the tourist ; but 

“ Who can paint like Nature ?”

for neither the pencil nor the pen can do them 
justice. To such, however, as are desirous of visit- 
ing those countries, this publication has been pro- 
jected as a guide ; and, it is hoped, will go far to 
supply what has hitherto been an important desi- 
deratum to travellers. The chief object of it is to 
save a stranger the trouble of putting frequent 
questions, which, in his progress through the coun- 
try, he would otherwise be forced to do ; and, while 
it sedulously avoids prolix description, it will not, 
it is presumed, be found deficient in useful, and, to 
a number, in essential information. 

To many travellers, who resort to the facility of 
conveyance which steam vessels afford, it may not 
appear uninteresting, nor out of place, here to state 
a few particulars relative to the invention of those 
useful vehicles, which are only known to a few 
scientific men : So far back as the year 1733, a 

publication was circulated, setting forth the advan- 
tages that would result from the use of vessels to 
be impelled by wheels, or paddles, and describing 
the mechanism by which they were to be put in 
motion ; a copy of which is preserved in the Advo- 
cates’ Library at Edinburgh. The proposal seems 
to have been considered so chimerical, that no no- 
tice was taken of it ; and the idea of such a power,

for purposes of navigation, lay dormant for near 
half a century, till the late patriotic and enterpris- 
ing Mr. Millar of Dalswinton, in Dumfries-shire, 
without any knowledge of the work alluded to, but 
with that genius and perseverance which marked 
his character, appears to have formed more correct 
notions of the practicability of propelling vessels 
by such means, and he set his mind to the con- 
struction of them upon scientific principles. Ac- 
cordingly, in 1776, he completed a small boat, with 
a steam engine, which was set in motion on the 
lake of Dalswinton, in presence of some ingenious 
persons of his acquaintance. 

Ten years thereafter, in 1786, a large vessel was 
built under his direction at Grangemouth, the en- 
gine and machinery of which were made by Mr. 
Symington, civil engineer ; and several experiments 
were made on the Forth and Clyde Canal, in pre- 
sence of Sir Thomas Dundas of Carse, and several 
other gentlemen connected in the management of 
the canal, which gave entire satisfaction ; but from 
the agitation of water which the action of the wheels 
produced, and the consequent risk of injuring 
the banks, this vessel was not considered as eligible 
for canal navigation. The late ingenious Earl of 
Stanhope afterwards made similar experiments in 
England, with the same satisfactory result. 

Of these discoveries we have seen an engraved 
plate, published in 1776, done from drawings 
by Mr. Nasmyth, which delineate paddles of the 
very same construction, and applied on the same 
principle as those now in use. 

From this, it appears, that the merit is not due 
to Mr. Fulton of America, who was on a visit 
to Scotland, and had, previously to his leav- 
ing this country, seen Mr. Millar’s invention. 
But the greatest praise is due to Mr. Henry 
Bell, of Glasgow ; who, with much labour 
and expense, invented several material improve- 
ments in the machinery, which now render steam

vessels so complete, and of such general benefit to 
the public. 

In 1800, Mr. Bell produced a large model of a 
steam vessel, 27 feet long, which he presented to 
the late Lord Melville, then at the head of the 
Board of Admiralty ; but being overlooked by his 
Lordship, and his colleagues, was eagerly adopted 
by the American government, and speedily put into 
successful practice upon the great rivers and lakes 
of that country. 

In the present age, when discoveries in science, 
and improvements in the arts, meet with general 
encouragement, it is surprising, and to be regret- 
ted, that nothing has been done towards procuring 
Mr. Bell a permanent remuneration for the great ad- 
vantages which this extensive community, as well 
as the whole kingdom, derive from his indefatiga- 
ble exertions ; — a consideration which becomes the 
more imperious, when we reflect on the unwearied 
toil, and anxiety of mind, as well as the loss of • 
health and property, which he has experienced in 
the completion of so important a national discovery. 

In tracing the usual course of the steam boats, 
the distances are stated in the topographical des- 
cription ; and, in conducting the traveller by land, 
a similar plan is pursued, where the stages and dis- 
tances are as accurately stated as possible, with re- 
ference to every place, as laid down in the maps. 
In both, as we proceed, are pointed out particular ,

PRELIMINARY ROUTE 


FROM 

EDINBURGH TO GLASGOW. 


/ 

*********** * *** 


* 

BY THE FORTH AND CLYDE CANAL, AND BY 

LANARK AND THE FALLS OF CLYDE. 

The northern metropolis of Britain being an im- 
portant point of attraction to strangers, is common- 
ly the earliest object of a visit to Scotland. It is 
from thence the assistance of a guide, to other parts 
of the kingdom, becomes most essential ; and where, 
most properly, it ought to commence. The capi- 
tal itself abounds in interesting features, of which 
the most limited description cannot be attempted, 
in a Work so concise as this ; but, in the “ Picture 
of Edinburgh,” ample information is obtained, re- 
garding the public buildings, and various institu- 
tions of the city ; and, should the stranger’s time 
allow it, a personal inspection of them will prove 
no ordinary source of gratification. 

The coup d’ceil, or general aspect of Edinburgh, 
is singularly beautiful, romantic, and magnificent ; 
probably not equalled, and certainly not surpassed 
by any city in the world. The bold constructure 
of the castle ; the venerable appearance of the old 
town, and imposing splendour of the new, are alike 
calculated to fascinate the attention ; and, by exa- 
mining them in detail, the stranger will find abun- 
dant scope for observation, in the singularly situated 

a‘id gigantic piles which characterize the former ; 

b

and the fine uniform ranges of building which per- 
vade the latter ; while, in each, the splendid edi- 
fices, which public spirit, and private munificence 
have reared, will solicit his notice at every step. 

To these attractive external objects, should he 
chance to unite associations drawn from the ancient 
history of the Scottish metropolis, when adorned | 
by the presence of royalty, and can recall to memo- ' 
ry the number of eminent characters to whom it has 
given birth, many of whose ashes now repose with- j 
in its boundary, an interest will be communicated 
to the survey, more acutely to be felt than describ- j 
ed. . But it is not to the manes of the illustrious 
dead alone, that his respect will extend ; for, a 
stranger cannot be ignorant, that at no previous ! 
era did the capital of the north boast of so many 
living ornaments of science and literature, in the 
several departments of the church, medicine, and 
the law. 

But, besides the eminence of its metropolis, Scot- 
land possesses many other objects of gratification, 
that cannot fail to be attractive and interesting to 
every philosopher of nature, and every traveller of 
taste ; for its mountainous regions, which exhibit 
innumerable scenes of sublimity, also contain inex- 
haustible subjects of natural history, and ample 
sources for antiquarian research. 

When the Highlands of Scotland present such a 
series of important investigation, it will not ap- 
pear wonderful that the country has attracted 
the notice of strangers, especially, as opportuni- 
ties of exploring its most distant mountains, and 
secluded valleys, are now obtained, with a de- 
gree of facility and expedition no less surprising 
than agreeable. 

Glasgow being the great port for steam vessels on 
the west coast of Scotland, the traveller should pro- 
ceed to that city, from whence he can almost daily 
have the advantage of these conveyances. When 
he is prepared to leave the capital, two routes are

presented to his choice, either of which pass through 
a track of country entirely different from the other ; 
yet both teeming with objects of great beauty 
and. interest. In the first of these,- which we shall 
notice, the tourist proceeds either to Leith , the sea- 
port of Edinburgh , or to Newhaven, a fishing village 
at a short distance, from which steam boats ply 
daily to Grangemouth, situated at the opening of 
the Great Canal into the Forth. 

Xhe scenery along the Frith of Forth is extreme- 
ly fine : the country on both sides being populous 
and highly cultivated; and exhibiting a succession 
of elegant modem mansions, interspersed with many 
reliques of ancient grandeur. The surface of the 
frith, as well as its borders, also presents a lively 
picture of commerce^^bm the multiplicity of ves- 
sels that are continually seen floating upon it. In 
the middle of the channel, will be observed the 
island of Inchcolm, with the noble ruins of its an- 
cient monastery, founded in 1123, by Alexander I. 
of Scotland, in gratitude to St. Columba, for his 
preservation on that island, from a storm, when 
crossing the frith. North of Inchcolm is the bay 
and town of Aberdour ; and, a little farther west, 
the bay and town of Invcrkeithing. The channel 
now becomes more narrow, by two points of the op- 
posite coasts that jut inwards, and being consider- 
ably elevated, have a very picturesque effect On 
the right are the remains of a mud fort, in use dur- 
ing the war, but now dismantled. In the centre of 
the passage is the rocky island of Inchgarvie, with 
its small castellated fort. On the right, pass the 
ferry town of North Queensferry ; and nearly oppo- 
site to it, : on the left, the town of South Queensfer- 
ry. Here the Forth, which now receives the name 
of river, begins to expand towards Hopetoun House, 
the superb mansion of the Earl of Hopetoun. 
Looking at some distance to the north, in an ele- 
vated situation, is seen the town of Dunfermline, 

with its ancient monastery ; and in the same direc-

tion, close to the shore, and at times surrounded 
by the tide, the fine old ruin of Rosyth Castle, 
where tradition reports that the mother of Crom- 
well was born, a circumstance that induced the 
usurper to visit it when he over-ran Scotland. 

Towards the west the prospect is now very mag- 
nificent. The airy mountains of Caledonia come 
into view; and although, from their distance, 
they appear enveloped in the clouds, still the eye 
can trace the bold outline of their majestic forms, 
with sufficient accuracy to distinguish the great 
elevation of their summits. The intermediate -space 
is beautifully occupied by the Ochil Hills, and the 
hoary turrets of Stirling Castle ; the ancient town 
of Clackmannan ; and, filling up the fore ground of 
this delightful picture, in succession are seen the 
Castle of Blackness, the towns of Borrowstowness , 
and Grangemouth on the south ; and on the north, 
Limekiln’s House, the Earl of Elgin, and its village, 
the towns of NemniUs, Torrybum, Culross, Kincar- 
dine, and Alloa ; with the beautifully situated 
Castle of Airth, Graham, on the south ; and, on the 
opposite side of the water, a great mansion build- 
ing, by Lord Keith. 

Arriving at Grangemouth, where the great Forth 
and Clyde Canal joins the river Forth, the travel- 
ler has the choice of walking, or of proceeding 
in a miserable vehicle called a coach, to Lock 
No. 16, a distance of four miles, where the Track 
Boats commence their passage along the canal to 
Glasgow ; and from whence they set off, at stated 
hours, three times a-day. These vessels are fitted 
up solely for the conveyance of passengers, each 
having two roomy cabins, with every accommoda- 
tion, including books, and other sources of amuse- 
ment. Refreshments are also to be had ; and the 
fares are considered moderate. Along the course 
of the Canal, from the Forth to the Clyde, few ob- 
jects of importance occur. In some places are still 
to be seen mouldering vestiges of the Roman Wall

of Antoninus ; as that barrier, formed to curb the 
fiery spirit of the Caledonians, ran nearly in the line 
of the canal. By this route, the excursion from Edin- 
burgh to Glasgow is performed in a day ; and being 
both economical and pleasant, is much resorted to 
by all classes of people. 

The other way we would point out, proceeds 
from Edinburgh by Lanark , following the river 
Clyde down to Glasgow. After leaving Edinburgh, 
the first object of attention is the aqueduct bridge 
across the valley of Slateford, and water of Leith; 
along which the new Union Canal is to pass. 
This bridge is the most considerable fabric of the 
kind in the kingdom. The canal is to be a branch 
from the Forth and Clyde, which it joins near Fal- 
kirk ; and will complete the inland navigation be- 
tween the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Some 
miles further to the left, but at a distance from the 
road, is the scenery of Ramsay’s Gentle Shepherd, 
in a valley imbosomed in the Pentland Hills, which 
are seen to the left for a considerable space. 

From Slateford the road passes through the vil- 
lage of Currie, and afterwards along a bleak un- 
interesting country to the town of Camwath. Some 
time before arriving at Lanark, the river Clyde is 
seen expanded to a broad surface, and rolling 
slowly in its course in unbroken grandeur, while 
its borders, skirted with lofty wood of variegated 
foilage, gives beauty and softness to the view. 
Lanark is situated on a high bank above the river. 
It is one of the oldest towns in Scotland, having 
been occupied by the Romans soon after their con- 
quest of the southern provinces ; and was subse- 
quently connected with many interesting circum- 
stances of Scottish history, of which none is more 
worthy of being mentioned, than that it was at La- 
nark the great Wallace made his first effort to re- 
lieve his country from the yoke of tyranny, by 
slaying Moubray, the English governor ; the house 

in which it took place is still standing in the 

*'• b 3

* 


town. Lanark Castle , of which the ruins now 
hardly point out the site, was built early in the 
12th century, by David I., and was the occa- 
sional residence of that monarch, and several of 
his successors. Lanark has some good inns, 
where travellers can procure guides to conduct 
them to the Falls of the Clyde, and other remark- 
able scenery in the neighbourhood. To many, 
however, this will not appear necessary, and may 
probably be disagreeable. 

The village of New Lanark, which is about 
1 1 mile distant from the old town, is generally first 
to engage the traveller’s attention on his way to 
the falls. Turning off from the high way to the 
right, it suddenly bursts upon the view. The 
situation is abundantly picturesque, in a beautiful 
valley, close to the extensive cotton mills erected by 
the late Mr. Dale, in 1785, and now the property of 
Owen and Company. New Lanark is chiefly occu- 
pied by the work people of this large establish- 
ment ; and here Mr. Owen (whose name may be 
familiar to the tourist, as that of the philanthropic, 
but eccentric projector of plans for ameliorating the 
condition of mankind,) has, with incessant assidui- 
ty, and with a degree of success which shows his 
speculations are not wholly visionary, laboured to 
reduce his benevolent theories to practice. The 
children of his workmen are carefully reared under 
his eye, and receive education from teachers ap- 
pointed by him, in appropriate places near the 
manufactory. After they grow up, and become fit 
for work, their laborious duties are relieved by a 
course of mental instruction, calculated to pro- 
mote habits of industry and rectitude ; and there is 
reason to believe, that die conduct of this little com- 
munity is generally correct and exemplary. The 
population of New Lanark is estimated at 2500 per- 
sons, of whom 1700 are employed at the cotton 
mills. In the neighbourhood of this seat of 
busy industry, is Dundaff Linn, a romantic fall

of water, though of inconsiderable height ; and a 
singular piece of rock, to which tradition has 
given the name of Wallace’s Chair. Here, it is 
said, the illustrious protector of his country’s 
liberties, found a temporary concealment in the 
day of adversity, from the blood-thirsty vengeance 
of his enemies. 

Taking the carriage road through the grounds 
of JBonniton, which is conducted along the banks 
of the river, the tourist soon obtains a view of the 
magnificent fall of Corra. A foot-path, which 
branches off to the right from the main way, 
brings him suddenly to the brink of a tremen- 
dous precipice, from which the Linn is seen to 
the greatest advantage. From this point the 
spectator may imagine himself seated in an im- 
mense amphitheatre, at the opposite extremity of 
which the collected mass of water rushes furiously 
into the abyss, boiling and foaming in its descent, 
and shooting upwards, from the pool into which 
it falls, a never-ending succession of vapours, 
which, when irradiated by the solar beams, as- 
sume the form and varying hues of the rainbow. 
The fall of the water is accompanied by an al- 
most deafening noise, to which the screaming of 
wild birds, constantly flitting around, gives a 
fearful sublimity. The cataract of Corra is 84 
feet in height, in which, however, there are three 
slight breaks ; but they detract but very little 
from the magnificence of the prospect. The sce- 
nery in the vicinity of the fall is of the boldest and 
most picturesque description. On either side of 
the ravine, along which the river takes its course, 
the rocks, adorned with natural wood, rise al- 
most perpendicularly ; while seated on a pinnacle, 
are seen the remains of the Castle of Corra ; and, 
overlooking the fall, a pavilion, erected about a cen- 
tury ago, by Sir James Carmichael of Bonniton. 
From the pavilion, a fine view of the cataract, the 
mills, and village of New Lanark, and the course

of the river, is also obtained, and an extensive pros- 
pect, which is terminated only by the lofty moun- 
tains of Stirling and Argyle. 

Above the fall of Corra, the precipitous banks of 
the Clyde are covered with wood ; the bed of the 
river is rugged, and its waters roll turbulently 
along ; but, at one place, the whole body of the 
stream is confined to a space little more than 1 0 
feet wide, representing a sluice, or flood-gate, 
formed by portions of rock that jut from both 
sides ; — a striking contrast with the wide-spreading 
surface of Corra, or the more placid appearance of 
the river above Bonniton Linn. Near this contrac- 
tion of the river, there is a curious cave in the rock, 
of which there is no tradition. Three quarters of a 
mile further up, the fall of Bonniton is situated. 
Though wanting the terrific magnificence of the 
lower cataract, the altitude of Bonniton not exceed- 
ing 27 feet, it is still a highly picturesque object. 
The river descends into a glen in a broad unbroken 
sheet; the contiguous scenery being exceedingly 
beautiful. Before reaching the fall, the channel is 
broad, and the course of the river uninterrupted 
and tranquil ; the banks slope gently down, and are 
ornamented by lofty trees ; altogether forming a 
remarkable contrast to the rugged and gigantic 
grandeur of the scenery below. Here an artificial 
island has lately been formed, in a fanciful man- 
ner, adding considerably to the picturesque effect 
of the prospect ; and, from it, a perfect view of the 
fall is obtained. 

Returning to Lanark, the steps of the traveller 
may next be directed to the scenery of the River 
Mouss, which joins the Clyde, about a mile below 
the town. This stream takes its course through a 
deep and precipitous chasm, called Cartlan Craigs, 
the sides of which are decorated with heath and 
coppice wood, imbosomed in which are numer- 
ous natural recesses, which tradition gives out as 
the occasional retreats of Wallace, and his patriotic

followers. In a beautiful woody hollow, on the 
banks of the Mouss, Barmaid House, Lockhart, is 
situated ; a little above which, on the south, is an 
echo, whose reverberations are remarkably loud 
and distinct, and not surpassed by any in the king- 
dom. 

Resuming his route, the traveller, after proceed- 
ing a short distance on the high- way, will take the 
path leading to the fall of Stmebyres. This is by 
a walk made a good many years ago, by the 
late Mr. Dale, down a steep hill, to the verge of 
the precipitous bank of the river, where a chair 
is placed, on which the traveller may be seated, 
and, in perfect security, survey the grand and ter- 
rific scene before him ; but another path, striking 
off from the public road, at the distance of a mile, 
has lately been formed by Mr. Owen ; and, from 
the serpentine direction in which it winds, down a 
finely wooded bank, the fall is seen to great per- 
fection. In this fall, (the altitude of which is 
variously estimated between 90 and 1 00 feet,) as 
in that of Corra, there are three breaks, and 
these more prominent than in the other. When 
the river is swollen with rain, they are not per- 
ceptible in either, the rapidity of the current 
precipitating the whole, in one body, into the 
boiling depths ; from whence columns of spray 
are continually ascending, that add to the sublimi- 
ty of this fearful scene. The rocks, which crown 
the fall, are fringed with natural wood, and by 

their rugged aspect, complete a picture of rural 

* • 

beauty scarcely to be equalled. In ascending the 
river, the salmon find here an insurmountable ob- 
stacle to their progress ; their endeavours to over- 
come which, in the spawning season, are as unremit- 
ting, as the object of them is unattainable, and afford 

t 

no small amusement to the spectator. As we have 
not pretended to give other than the popular opin- 
ion regarding the respective altitudes of the falls, 
we cannot vouch for its accuracy ; but allowing for 


22 


PRELIMINARY ROUTE 


a little exaggeration, it will still appear, that in the 
course of the short distance from Bonniton to Stone- 
byres , the river has a descent of nearly 200 
feet 

Mere prose description fails to convey any adequate 
idea of the impressions caught from viewing these 
sublime works of nature ; and even the poet and 
the painter can present but a barren delineation of j 
scenes so fraught with beauty and magnificence. 
The traveller will, however, after visiting them, 
admit the fidelity of resemblance, which reigns in 
the following picture, by the great bard of Nature, 
and of the Seasons ; while from it, the stranger 
may gather a lively anticipation of the pleasure 
that awaits his pilgrimage to the falls of Clyde. 

j 

# 

“ Smooth to the shelving brink a copious flood 
Rolls fair and placid ; where, collected all 
In one impetuous torrent, down the steep 
It thundering shoots, and shakes the country round. 

At first an azure sheet, it rushes broad ; 

Then whitening by degrees, as from it falls, 

And, from the loud-resounding rocks below. 

Dash’d in a cloud of foam, it sends aloft 
A hoary mist, and forms a ceaseless shower. 

Nor can the tortur’d wave here find repose; 

But raging still amid the shaggy rocks, 

Now flushes o’er the scatter’d fragments ; now 
Aslant the hallow’d channel rapid darts ; 

And falling fast from gradual slope to slope, 

'With wild infracted course, and lessen’d roar. 

It gains a safer bed, and steals at last 
Along the mazes of the quiet vale.”

* 

Regaining the main road, the traveller crosses 
the little river Nethan, which flows through a ro- 
mantic glen, where, on a promontory of considera- 
ble elevation, are seen the ruins of Drqffin, or 
Craignethan Castle, the property of Loid Douglas. 
In this castle the beautiful and unfortunate Mary, 
of Scotland, found a temporary asylum from her 
persecutors, after her escape from Loch Leven 
castle. Further on is the village of Dclserf; anti.

beautifully situated on the north bank of the Clyde, 
Mauldslie Castle, the seat of the noble family of 
Hyndford, at present the residence of Henry Mon- 
teith. Lord Provost of Glasgow. Along the 
vale of Clydesdale, there are several other man- 
sions, finely situated, which combine with 
other objects to form a continued scene of pic- 
turesque beauty. At the termination of the vale, 
the traveller enters the Carlisle road ; and, turning 
to the right, a mile further on, arrives at Avon 
bridge. Here is also the entrance to Ckatelerault, a 
summer residence belonging to the Duke of Hamil- 
ton, built in imitation of a chateau in France, the 
property of his ancestors. Chatelerault is seated on 
the river Avon ; and, on the opposite bank, stands 
the Castle of Cadzoiv, now a heap of mouldering 
ruins. During the convulsions which marked the 
reign of the unhappy Queen Mary, Cadzorv was 
plundered, and partly dilapidated, by the follow- 
ers of the Regent Murray, flushed with their suc- 
cess at the fatal battle of Langside. Around this 
ruin are some of the oldest and most stately oak 
trees in the kingdom, many of which are about 30 
feet in circumference ; but they are now hastening 
to decay. Here too is to be seen some of the old 
Scottish breed of cattle, still retaining their origi- 
nal whiteness, and native wildness. A short dis- 
tance below Cadzorv, on the same side of the stream, 
is Barncluith, a villa built in the Dutch style, from 
the turretted garden of which a fine view of 
the Avon is obtained. Withdrawing from this 
fascinating spot, the tourist enters the town of 
Hamilton, where he may refresh himself from the 
fatigues of his journey, in an excellent inn, kept by 
Mrs. Currie. Hamilton is a manufacturing place, 
with a population of about 7000, but contains no 
object of note. 

In the valley, between the town and the river, 
stands the ducal mansion, a huge and tasteless pile, 
built at different periods. There, however, the

stranger will enjoy a rich treat in the inspection of 
the splendid collection of pictures, belonging to the 
family, and which has received important additions 
from the present Duke, whose taste in the fine arts, ' 
led him, previous to his accession to the title, to 
form a separate collection, the greatest part of 
which has lately been removed hither from his 
seat in England. In the original stock there are 
several valuable portraits by British and Flemish 
artists, including the magnificent picture of the 
Earl of Denbigh going a-shooting. The Daniel 
in the den of Lions, by Rubens, which was also 
in the old collection, is too well known to require 
description. In the new, there are many pic- 
tures, by the first Italian artists, of great beauty 
and value. 

Taking the road to Glasgow, the traveller crosses 
the Clyde by the ancient Bridge of Bothwell, the 
scene of the discomfiture of the Cameramans, in 
1 679* A short way on is the village of Bothwell ; 
the parish church of which is of great antiquity. It 
is a gothic structure, and entirely composed of 
stone, the roof being of the same material as the 
walls. 

The traveller is now near one of the most pic- 
turesque and venerable monuments of the ancient 
splendour of the Scottish nobility, to be met with 
in the kingdom. Passing through the fine domains 
of Lord Douglas, he has a view of the modem 
mansion, an elegant and extensive pile ; and im- 
mediately beyond it, in stately grandeur, rise the 
lofty walls and majestic turrets of the ancient 
castle of Bothwell, beautifully seated on the north- 
ern bank of the Clyde. This admirable fortress 
originally covered a great extent of ground, and 
what still remains of its former glory, occupies a 
space of 234 feet in length by 99 in breadth. The 
walls are of enormous thickness ; and, in the me- 
lancholy progress of their desolation, exhibit huge

masses that have fallen down, and- are strewed 
around in all directions ; the stones of which are 
still held together by a cement of extraordinary 
durability. The court within is extensive, and 
remains of apartments are still to be seen in the 
east and west ends of the building, as also of 
the chapel, indicated by a number of small win- 
• dows ; contiguous to which is a state chamber, 
having two large windows looking to the south. 
In one of the towers an old well, penetrating the 
rock to a considerable depth, was some time ago dis- 
covered. - By a flight of steps, which is almost en- 
tire to the top, the : inquisitive stranger can ascend 
one of the highest towers, the summit of which is 
at an immense height above the surface of . the ri- 
ver. On the opposite bank is seen, erected on the 
brink of a perpendicular rock, the ruins of ISlan- 
lyre Priory, founded in the 13th century. The 
grounds around the ancient castle are finely laid 
out, and embellished by lofty woods, the growth of 
ages ; beneath the umbrageous canopy of which the 
walks branch off in every direction. Here the 
moralist will probably pause, when he reverts to 
the various incidents of history with which those 
noble ruins are connected. They will naturally re- 
call to memory, the pomp and grandeur which 
pervaded them in the days of their glory ; and 
the mind will draw a melancholy contrast with the 
now silent halls, and mouldering turrets, of this 
once magnificent fabric. 

Leaving this scene of exquisite beauty, so replete 
with interest to the painter, the poet, and the mo- 
ralist, the traveller pursues his route, passing 
through the pretty village of Uddingston , and along 
a pleasant highway, crossing the North Colder Ri- 
ver. At the distance of rather more than 3 miles from 
Glasgow, the road enters the village of Tolcross ; to 
the south of which Clyde Iron Works are erected, with 
its adjacent colliery. These works were extensive- 
ly employed during the late war, and are of great

magnitude, though now on a scale of limited opera- 
tion. In succession the traveller passes through 
the villages of Parkhead and Camlachie, and enters 
Glasgow by the Gallowgate. Besides this, there is 
another road that strikes off from Hamilton, passing 
along the south side of the river Clyde, by the vil- 
lage of Cambuslang, and the town of Rutherglen. 
This is a pleasant ride, through some very roman- 
tic scenery, interspersed with many elegant man- 
sions and villas ; from several parts of which differ- 
ent beautiful and interesting views of the city of 
Glasgow, and the more distant Campsie hills, are 

4 

obtained ; and, from one point, an extensive pros- 
pect of the blue mountains of Argyle, Arran, and 
the Craig of Ailsa. 

The road crosses the Clyde, a short way from 
Rutherglen, by a handsome bridge, built some years 
ago. When the wooden bridge, presently erecting 
a little farther up the river, at Dalmarnock ford, is 
completed, it will not only be an additional orna- 
ment to the environs, but will afford an entrance of 
greater facility into Bridgetoun, an extensive suburb 
of Glasgow.

FROM GLASGOW TO INVERARAY. 

TO PORT GLASGOW, 24 m. GREENOCK, 2 Itl. 

ROTHESAY, 19 nt. LOCHGILP, 42 m. INVERA- 

RAY, 22 m. — -—In all 109 miles. 

The Clyde, upon which the city of Glasgow is 
situated, is one of the principal rivers in Scotland ; 
and has its rise among the interior mountains that 
divide the counties of Lanark and Dumfries. The 
length of this stream, from its source to its junc- 
tion with the western sea, is about 1 00 miles ; and, 
along its whole course, is beautified by magnificent 
natural scenery, and adorned with many embellish- 
ments of art ; while its banks are also crowded with 
the abodes of industry, and a thriving population, 
as already detailed in the preceding route. 

The site of Glasgow occupies both sides of the 
river ; and, though at the distance of 45 miles from 

its influx to the sea, the tide flows a considerable 

* 

way above the town ; an advantage which gives it 
a command of trade, and a ready conveyance for 
commercial purposes, to every quarter of the globe, 
though large vessels, belonging to the city, cannot 
come nearer than Port Glasgow and Greenock. 

Glasgow , like other ancient towns of Scotland, 
whose consequence depended upon its archiepisco- 
pal establishment, was often the scene of religious 
contest, and civil commotion. It seems originally, 
however, to have been a station of Roman conquest, 
maintained by those invaders from the peculiarity 
of its situation, amidst the fertile plains of Clydes- 
dale, as well as from its vicinity to the sea ; con- 
siderations of which the Romans always availed

themselves. But, in modem times, particularly in 
the present day, the importance of Glasgow, and 
the chief source of its progressive prosperity and 
improvement, have arisen from the successful pro- 
secution of its Cotton Manufacture, which is con- 
ducted with a degree of perfection unexampled in 
any other part of the world, and which has in- 
creased the population of the city to an extent un- 
equalled in the municipal history of any provincial 
town in Great Britain; for, in -1788, it contained 
only 49,000 ; but now, in 1820, the short period of 
32 years, the census lately taken makes the num- ; 
ber 154,000 inhabitants, being an increase of 1 
105,000. 

Referring the stranger to Chapman’s Picture of 
Glasgow, and to Clcland’s Rise and Progress of that 
city, for every thing remarkable in it, and in the 
vicinity, we shall now take up our course from the 
harbour of Glasgow, named the Broomielaw, ex- 
tending from the new bridge for a considerable way ! 
along the north side of the river. ' Fifteen years i 
ago, vessels of more than 50 tons could not get up 
to the city ; but such attention has lately been be- j 
stowed in deepening and banking the river, that 

vessels of 170 tons burden can now lie at the quay; 

« 

the extremity of which is appropriated for the con- 
venience of the numerous steam vessels that are 
constantly plying upon the river. 

On leaving Glasgow, various manufactories, the 
bridges, the spires, and a considerable portion of 
the city, are in view. A stranger will also re- 
mark the level banks of the river extending to 
some distance, which show, that during a series 
of ages, its course must have undergone different 
changes. One geological observation may, how- 
ever, here be made : — That the flat ground now oc- 
cupied by the town, and extending for some miles 
on both sides of the river, along its course down- 
wards, seems, at an early period, to have been 
covered with water, and formed a considerable

arm of the sea, till the general and perhaps 
gradual receding of the sea from the west 
coast, left the river to form and keep by its own 
channel. This opinion is confirmed by the nature 
of the soil, the substratum of which, by digging 
into, is formed of marine gravel and shells, while 
the upper is all alluvial. 

The first object that comes in view is the village 
of Govan, not inelegantly situated among surround- 
ing trees ; having previously passed the VerreviUe 
Glasswork, Geddes ; and Finnieston Village, Stob- 
cross, Phillips ; and Yoker Hill, Gilbert. 

At Govan there is a regular ferry to the conflu- 
ence of the Kelvin, a beautiful stream, originating 
in the Campsie hills, and has its course diversified 
by various falls and windings, while its banks are 
adorned by numerous elegant villas and planta- 
tions, tastefully laid down. Opposite to Govan, 
are the village and city Mills of Partick ; and near 
it the ruins of a mansion, formerly occupied by the 
archiepiscopal prelate of Glasgow ; which, before 
the introduction of manufactures and commerce 
rendered the banks of the Clyde and Kelvin so po- 
pulous, must have been a situation of beauty and 
comfort ; to both of which advantages the clergy 
of former times were not indifferent. 

Proceeding along, many villas, the residence of 
opulence, and the efforts of industry, are to be seen 
on both sides of the river ; and a few miles from the 
city, the view becomes more extensive. 

On the right, 1 mile from Govan, is Broomhill, 
Perston ; and 1 ^ mile farther on the left, Linthouse, 
Watson ; on the same side, but more distant. Shield- 
hall, Oswald ; and on the right, also at some dis- 
tance, Jordanhill, Smith ; on the plain below it, 
about 1^ mile further on, Scotstoun, Oswald ; oppo- 
site, on the left, Braehead, McCall ; and 1 mile far- 
ther, Elderslie House, the elegant mansion of Spiers ; 
a short way forward, on the same side, the town 
of Renfrew, an ancient burgh, near which once

stood a palace of the first Stewart monarchs. The 
old church still contains some antique statues ; 
and near the town is a tumulus, reared to com- 
memorate the defeat of Somerlid, thane of Ar- 
gyle, by Angus, in 1164. At Renfrew, there 
is a regular ferry, where carriages and horses 
are safely crossed, 3 miles distant from Paisley. 
On the opposite side, Yoker Lodge, Bennet ; and on 
the left, 1 mile further, is Renfield, Campbell of 
Blythswood, a superb modern house ; a short way 
on the same side, is the mouth of the Cart River, 
looking up which is seen Inchinnan Bridge, at its 
junction with the Gryffe ; and, at 3 miles distance, 
the town of Paisley and Gleniffer Hills ; near this 
bridge is a stone, placed where the gallant Marquis 
of Argyle was taken, in 1685 ; at the mouth of the 
Cart once stood the palace of Inchinnan, a royal re- 
sidence, of which there ' remains no vestige, 
and the site is now that of a farm steading. Here is 
a small island called Newshot, so named from its 
recent appearance, being formed of mud and allu- 
vion. A little on, in the high ground, at a distance, 
is Cockney, Hamilton. Here a greater extent of 
Dunbartonshire comes into view. On the right, 
2 miles on, the Alkaline Works of Lord Dundas ; 
Dalmuir House, and Paper Mills, Collins ; the 
most extensive paper works in Scotland. Auchen- 
toshan, Cross, and Mountblow, Bowie; a little further 
on, at some distance, in a valley, Duntocher Cotton 
Mills, Dunn. Almost opposite, on the left. Park, Ful- 
ton ; 1 mile further. North Bar ; and near the wa- 
ter, the house which belonged to, and where Peg- 
gy, the erf ant trouve of Ramsay’s Gentle Shepherd, 
was born. One mile distant, on the right, is Ers- 
kine Ferry ; and near it, Dalnotter Hill, from which 
is a charming view down the Clyde. Beyond this 
is the Church and Village of Kilpatrick, said to be the 
birth place of the tutelar saint of Ireland. Not long 
since the old church was taken down, after having 
stood for several centuries ; and on its site the pre-

sent one was erected. Many tomb stones of great 
antiquity are to be seen in the cemetery. At Dun- 
tocher, about two miles to the right, there is still to 
be seen a Roman bridge, perfectly entire, near the 
line of the Roman wall. 

Here suddenly bursts upon the sight, one of the 
most admirable prospects perhaps in the world. 
In front, the Clyde expands to a noble breadth, 
bounded on the north by the steep and wooded 
hills of Kilpatrick, and on the south by the slop- 
ing hills of Renfrewshire ; while the castles of 
Dunglas and Dunbarton jutting into the sea, with 
the lofty mountains of Argyle in the distance, form 
a picture, which, for richness and variety, is rarely 
to be contemplated. 

Nearly opposite, on the left, is Erskine House, for- 
merly the property of the Earls of Mar, now that of 
Lord Blantyre ; further on 1 mile, on the right is 
Glenarhack, Robertson ; and near it is Bowling Inn 
and Bay, where the great canal from the Forth 
joins the Clyde. It is in contemplation to carry a 
branch of the canal from this place to Dunbarton, so 
as to render the navigation more certain, as the 
Clyde above Dunbarton is only passable at high wa- 
ter, whereas vessels can reach that town at any time 

of the tide A mile further on is Frisky Hall, 

Smith ; and Auchintorlie, Buchanan. Here, on a 
rocky promontory, stand the ruins of Dunglas 
Castle, a Roman station, anciently the western ter- 
mination of Antoninus’ wall, which extended from 
Blackness castle, on the Frith of Forth, nearly in 
the line of the canal ; and no situation could 
more appropriately have been chosen for such a 
strong-hold. Dunglas might still have been a for- 
tress in the delightful landscape now before us, 
had it not been blown up, in 1 G40, by the treache- 
ry of an English boy, and nearly reduced to the 
state in which, at present, it appears. — On the left, 
at a distance, is the Church and Manse of Erskine ; 
and 1 mile further, Bishopton House, Sir J.

Maxwell ; and close to it. Drums, King ; opposite, 
on the right. Little Mill Bleachfield, and Milton, 
Mitchell ; and behind it, Dumbuck Hill. Having 
passed Dunglas Castle, the most prominent and strik- 
ing object is Dunbarton Rock and Castle ; behind 
which is the sloping point of Roseneath ; to the left, 
the town and shipping of Port Glasgow and Greenock ; 
and, dimly rising in the distance, the blue moun- 
tains of Argyleshire appear. 

Here, if the weather be clear, a fine view of Ben- 
lomond is to be obtained along the valley of Le- 
ven ; with the relative situation of its kindred 
lake. 

The Steam Boats, in passing Dunbarton Castle, 
generally keep so close to it, that a pretty accurate 
view may be had. The difficulty and danger that 
must have attended the building of the walls will 
be evident ; and though apparently inaccessible, it 
was taken, by escalade, in 1551 ; an exploit hardly 
credible, when the fortress is examined. On the 
highest pinnacle of the rock, are the remains of a 
building supposed of Roman origin, or more pro- 
bably of Celtic formation, which must have been 
an alarm tower, or watch beacon, to communicate 
intelligence to a distance. Behind the castle stand 
the town and glass works of Dunbarton, to be no- 
ticed afterwards. Opposite the castle, on the 
left. West Sea Bank ; and beyond the castle, on 
the right, Leven Grove, Dixon ; on the left, 
2 miles further on, Finlayston, Campbell ; on the 
right, Clyde Bank, M'Kenzie ; and 1 mile further, 
Clyde Cottage, Graham ; about 2 miles further, ‘ 
on the left, Broadfield, Crawford ; on the right, 
and 1 mile distant, Cardross Village Church and 
Parsonage, and the ferry .of Craigend ; opposite on 
the left, Parklee and Carnegie Park ; and near the 
town and harbour of Port Glasgow, is the venera- 
ble ruin of Newark Castle, the former residence of 
a noble family of that title, now the property of 
Lord Belhaven.

• Port Glasgow was built upon land acquired by 

the city of Glasgow , in 1667, from the barony 
of Newark, and endowed by charter from Charles 
I. From its vicinity to Greenock, the erection of 
this port may appear superfluous ; but it took place 
from a dispute betwixt the merchants of Glasgow 
trading across the Atlantic, and those of Greenock, 
regarding harbour dues, which induced the former 
to establish this as an independent harbour of their 
own. — Two miles further, on the right, is the hill of 
Ardmore, Giles, a peninsulated hill, rising abruptly 
from the water ; a little above which, is Camus Eskan, 
or Colgrain, Denniston ; two miles north of which is 
Kilmahew Castle and Drumfork House. In the cen- 
tre of an extensive bay to the north, stands the vil- 
lage of Helensburgh, round which are many gentle- 
men’s seats, afterwards to be mentioned, as we pro-

ceed by the land tour. 

After a sail of about two hours and a half from 
Glasgow, the Steam Boats arrive- at Greenock. This 
town has of late years become one of the most con- 
siderable sea ports in the kingdom ; and from the 
recent formation of quays and docks, very large 
vessels can now be received into them. The town, 
though somewhat handsome and regularly built, 
has nothing particularly attractive, unless it be the 
new customhouse, near the quay, which is an ele- 
gant building. The town, however, abounds in 
good inns, which are not inferior to the best 
in the kingdom. The trade is great, ' from all 
parts of the world, and ship building, and various 
important manufactures carried on to a large ex- 
tent* 

' The Clyde here expands to a great bay, sur- 
rounded by several points of land jutting intq 
it, from the north, to which, the hills of the

interior, receding in the distance, till their lofty sum- 
mits are enveloped in the clouds, give an interesting 
picture to the eye of every beholder ; and, when to 
such fine natural objects are added, the vivid acti- 
vity of commerce, displayed by the numerous sails 
that crowd the surface of the frith at this place, an 


sive trade of the Clyde will be formed, and be a 
subject of exultation to every patriotic mind. 

Having left Greenock, many neat villas are seen 
on the left along the shore ; and, at a short dis- 
tance, a small battery to protect the town. About 
2 miles from Greenock , is the village of Gourock, 
resorted to, in summer, as bathing quarters ; and 
above which stands the House of Gourock , Dar- 
roch ; on the east side of the bay is a whin 
dyke running into the sea. Here are some mines 
which formerly produced copper and fluor spar, but 
are not now wrought. 

From the extreme altitude of the hills on this coast, 
the atmosphere is naturally very moist ; but though, 
from this cause, the climate is variable, it is at the same 
time salubrious. At this place, as well as at Green- 
ock, excellent boats are to be hired for the purpose 
of visiting the neighbouring lochs, and the romantic 
views which they so amply afford. On the left, 1 
mile further, is the old Tower of Leven, finely si- 
tuated on an eminence, and of such antiquity that 
all traces of its history are lost. Close by is Leven 
Temple, M'Inroy ; Leven Castle, Crooks ; and Glen 
Leven Cottage, Miss Stewart. About 1 mile on is 
the Clough Lighthouse, where there is a regular fer- 
ry to and from Dunoon, on the opposite coast of 
Argyle, and from which, there is a road to the fer- 
ry of Otter and Lochgilphead, on Loch fine.* 


* The Steam Boats, if required, will land passengers at 
Dunoon ; from whence there is also a road to Inverary by 
Slrackur, to which place gigs can be had, at a moderate rate. 
From Strachur there is a regular ferry across Lochfine to 
Creggans, and where boats can be procured to Inveraru di- 
rect; the distance up the loch being about 5 miles.

HIGHLAND SCENERY, ISLAND OF BUTE. 15 


Dunoon is of considerable antiquity, and was 
once the seat of a castle, very important in point of 
situation, and often the scene of contest during the 
violent struggles of clanship. Near the latter pe- 
riod of episcopacy in the Highlands, it was the oc- 
casional residence of the bishop of Argyle; but 
such is the mutability of human affairs, that hardly 
a stone of this fortress remains, a quantity of 
rubbish only being visible to point out the place 
where once it stood. 

The surrounding prospects from this point are 
very fine ; the opening of the lochs among such 
lofty mountains, with the charming view down the 
Frith, must strike every stranger with admiration ; 
for here begin the bold and sublime features of 
the Highland scenery, to contemplate which, must 
bring to the mind the recollection of various inci- 
dents of Caledonian and Scottish tradition ; of war 
and the chace, — of love and song, peculiar to those 
regions. In particular, it will be remembered, 
that those arms of the sea often bore the hostile 
fleets of marauding Norwegians, and that the 
shores were repeatedly the scenes of contest for 
national religion and liberty, or individual aggran- 
dizement — the first by the individual exertions of 
the immortal Wallace and Bruce ; and the lat- 
ter by the sanguinary conflicts of ambitious chief- 
tains. 

Passing along, in succession are seen, on the left, 

■* 

Ardgowan , Sir M. Shaw Stewart ; a part of which 
building is very ancient. And immediately adjoin- 
ing is the village of Inner kip, resorted to as ' sea- 
bathing quarters. 

Here a distant view of the coast of Ayr is to be 
had on the left, with the village of Largs, Knock 
Castle, Skehnorlie, and the islands of Cumbras ; 
The island of Bute is now at hand, and, on the 
south side, a view of Mount Stewart House, the seat 
of the Marquis of Bute. 

Approaching the Island of Bute, pass the point of

16 ROTHESAY CASTLE, BUTE. 


Totvart, on the right, on the Cowal shore, a district of j 
Argyleshire, where is placed a lighthouse ; and nearit 
stands the ruin of Towart Castle, the ancient inhe- 
ritance of the Lamonts ; and which, like every 
other habitation of chieftainship, was the frequent 
position of local war, as well as a defence against 
marauding banditti. To the west, nearly opposite, is 
Rothesay town and bay, which, at this distance, ap- 
pears to wind far into the island. Rothesayis the coun- 
ty town of the Island of Bute. Its situation is plea- 

sant and healthy, and bears evident proofs of great 
antiquity, particularly from its castle, built for a 
royal residence, and long occupied as such by the 
early Scottish monarchs. Its architecture is that 
of the rude security of the twelfth century, with 
walls of immense thickness. The antiquary will 
find much gratification in examining its structure ; 
while to the moralist it will call up reflections that 
may be pleasing, even though tinged with the hue 
of melancholy. The hoary aspect of this ruin, 
rendered venerable to every Scotsman, from its 
original possessors and their glorious achieve- 
ments, gives a degree of grandeur and interest to 
the island, which otherwise it would not possess ;* 

* The era of the building of Rothesay Castle may be consider- 
ed as coeval with the most ancient fortresses of Scotland , erect- 
ed, in all probability, by the Scots, as a check upon the turbu- 
lent Norwegians, who subdued the more westerly islands in the 
11th century. It was early subjected to assault, and a fierce 
attack was made upon it by those northern pirates, who are 
said to have reduced it, and pillaged it of great wealth. The 
site of thi3 castle, originally, was circular, 138 feet in breadth, 
the surrounding wall being 8 feet thick, and 17 high ; flanked 
with four round towers, with an exterior wet ditch 1 5 feet 
deep. It had undergone many additions by several monarchs, 
according to their taste or necessities, until it became an exten- 
sive building, fitted up with numerous apartments, appro- 
priated to various desultory purposes, according to the rude 
exigencies of the times. It had also the usual appendage of a 
chapel, which, in the days of Popery, was always the first to 
be considered ; and the remains of that portion, still to be seen, 
is among the most ancient parts of the castle. Many different 
parts are pointed out, and their uses described, but principally 
from conjecture, as the castle has remained a ruin from 1685, 
when it was burnt. 7 here can be no doubt, however of its 
great antiquity ; and the stranger should visit it, to examine the 
massive architecture of the period in which it was reared.

yet it has many advantages in point of situation. 
During the summer months, it is crowded with 
people from Glasgow, and other places, who resort 
to it for the benefit of sea-bathing. The interior of 
the island, which is 1 8 miles in length, and five in 
breadth, contains several remains of antiquity ; 

m 

among which are a vitrified fort, and Romish cha- 
pel. Many cairns, as they are called, are also 
scattered over the island, where urns, containing 
the ashes of departed warriors, have been found. 

These cairns are large heaps of stones thrown 

♦ 

around the place where those urns wfere deposited, 
and which were increased by every occasional pas- 
senger, who held it a sacred duty to add a stone to 

„ * / 4 . 

the heap, as a mark of respect to the memory of 
the dead ; hence it is still a common phrase in the 
Highlands, in return for a good action, to say, “ I 
will give a stone to your memory.”' In different 
parts of the island the brecchia or puddingstone 
rock is met with, and some whin dykes intersect 
it in the usual course, from north-east to south- 
west. Slate is also abundant here, a quarry of 
which yields a considerable quantity ; but the. qua- 
lity is inferior, and the colour bad, and much mo- 
ney has been lost in the undertaking. 

The names of places in the Highlands may ap- 
pear singular to strangers unacquainted with the 
local history and language of the country ; but they 
were always bestowed as descriptive of natural ap- 
pearances, or accidental circumstances, which, in 
general, were so applicable, that they could not be 
mistaken In going along, we might give numer- 

ous and copious etymological disquisitions regard- 
ing such names ; but as they would lead us be- 
yond the limits we have prescribed for the present 
work, we shall only give such as appear remarkable. 

From Rothesay, the channel, for some miles, takes 
a north-westerly course, leaving the Clyde, and 
taking the name of the Kyles of Buie, which en- 
circles half the island. Opposite to Rothesay bay is

Achenwillan, Kirkman Finlay, Esqi ; and 2 miles 
north, on the left, is Port Bannatyne Bay and Village, 
which, as well as Rothesay, is the occasional retreat of 
sea-bathing visitors ; at the head of the bay stands 
Karnes Castle, Hamilton, a romantic situation ; and, 
near it, an old tower, in ruins. In sailing through 
this channel, several agreeable prospects are met 
with. A few miles farther on to the right is the open- 
ing of Loch Striven; and near it the house of South- 
hall, Campbell ; about 3 miles from it is a ferry called 
Collintray ; close to it are some rocky islands, and 
the mouth of Loch Ridden, where is Red Island, on 
which are the ruins of a castle of that name, used 
as a garrison, in 1685, in favour of Monmouth. On 
the same side, at Arden, are many tumuli of Norwe- 
gians, who perished on the coast, about 700 years 
ago, after pillaging the surrounding countries, 
and taking the castl.i of Rothesay. Pass the Point of 
Ardlamont and enter Loch Fyne ; Inchmamock Island 
on the left, and soon after the House of Lamont ; 
half way betwixt it and Tarbert is the Skate Island, 
from which there is a fine view of the mountainous 
and rugged Island of Arran, with the coast of Kin- 
tyre, and an extensive prospect up Loch Fyne, and 
some of the ulterior mountains. The coast of Kin- 
tyre, on the left, becomes more wild and barren, 
and at East Tarbert, where the steam boats gene- 
rally call, the aspect of the shore is peculiarly for- 
bidding, being a rude mass of rock almost without 
the appearance of a vegetating shrub. The en- 
trance to this harbour is very critical ; being inter- 
rupted with many sunken rocks ; but when a ves- 
sel is in, no place can be more secure from any wind 
that can blow.* On the left, in gloomy elevation, 
towering on a sullen crag, stand the ruins of Tar- 
bert Castle. The isthmus of Kintyre is here only 

* A packet sails regularly every Thursday from the head of 
West Loch Tarbert to Port Askaig, in the island of Islay, tak- 
ing passengers or goods landed from the steam boats, at East 
Loch Tarbert, for Islay, Jura, and Colonsay.

TARBERT, INVERARY.

1 mile across, from east to west Tarbert ; and 
this castle was erected to check the incur- 
sions of the Irish, during the period when the 
Lords of the Isles were sovereigns of Kintyre , and 
the greater part of Argyllshire. Before the Crinan 
Canal was projected, it was in contemplation to car- 
ry a canal across this narrow neck of land ; but 
some objection arose from the length of West 
Loch Tarbert, and the difficulty of its naviga- 
tion. Leaving Tarbert, for some miles north- 
wards the shore continues bold and rough ; but 
gradually softens towards Invemeil, a sweet re- 
sidence, enveloped in wood. Presently the ba- 
sin of the Crinan Canal is approached ; and at 2 
miles distant is seen the delightful mansion of Oak- 
jieldy Macneil; and the village of Lochgilphead. 
Leaving the Canal Basin , or the point of Ardrissaig, 
as it is named, cross the mouth of Loch Gilp, again 
enter Loch Fine, and pass the pon.t of Silvercraigs, at 
some distance from which is seen Kilmory, and 
Castleton, on the left; on the opposite side, on 
the right, Kilfinan Church and Gordon Bank, 
McLeod ; and farther on. Otter, ferry and house of 
that name, Campbell. About 3 miles forward, on the 
left, Lochgair House, Campbell ; and 3 miles more, 
Minart, Campbell. Opposite to Minart, is Castle 
Lachlan in ruins, M'Lachlan. On the left, Crarae 
Inn ; and 2 miles on, Goatfield, and Iron Foundery, 
now given up. Three miles on, Creggans ferry ; op- 
posite to which, on the right, is Strachur, Campbell ; 
4 miles farther on, St. Catherine’s, where is a ferry 
to Inverary. At some distance is seen the house of 
Ardkinglas, Campbell. On approaching Invei'ary, 
the view of its castle, and behind it, the hill of 
Dunquaick , are very striking ; while the beauty of 
the surrounding wood, the simple appearance of 
the town, and the numerous boats in the bay dur- 
ing the herring fishing season, give a combination 
of picturesque objects peculiar to that place. In 

the vicinity are some places worth seeing, such as

INVERARY. 


Glenaray, Asechosan, and the prospect from die Tower 
on Dunquakh , which being about 700 feet high, 
commands a fine view of the extensive and culti- 
vated domains that immediately surround it, as well 
as an outline of distant lurid mountains, destined 
to remain in a state of irreclaimable barrenness. 
The quantity of wood about Inverary is very con- 
siderable, and has been estimated as worth above 
£200,000. The roads through it are numerous, 
and many romantic walks intersect and beautify 
the enclosures. On the river Aray are some fine 
water-falls, rendered accessible by paths made for 
the convenience of those who visit them. The ar- 
tificial embellishments of this place have chiefly 
been accomplished since the last civil commotion 
of 1745, when the foundation of the castle was laid; 
the old house having stood too near the town, 
which, besides being dark and inconvenient with- 
in, had, in external appearance, the lowering aspe- 
rity of baronial superiority. The present castle, to 
an eye of scrupulous observation, may perhaps 
seem defective in point of elevation ; and, though 
it be a large edifice, may appear rather diminu- 
tive, from being placed so near the base of Dun- 
quaich. It is built of dark blue stone, which, in 
its colour, appropriately enough assimilates with 
the sombre scenery of the surrounding objects ; 
while its Gothic architecture, with propriety, 
has been chosen for the residence of a power- 
ful chief; and, no doubt, had the effect of pro- 
curing respect, and producing a degree of intimi- 
dation among a barbarous people, in an unsettled 
age and state of society. The castle is a square 
building, having a round tower at each comer, and 
surmounted with battlements. The interior is fit- 
ted up with considerable taste, and splendidly fur- 
nished, having many spacious apartments, two of 
which only are remarkable. There are several 

good paintings, and some books of value. Since

the year 1745, it is reported that about £350,000 
hav e been laid out in ornamenting the place, the 
late Duke of - Argyle having expended £3000 a- 
year, during his possession of that title ; but he 
was not given to the amusements of Newmarket, 
nor to the facinating delights and hazards of the 
faro. The town of Inverary is of very recent 
foundation, and has scarcely any trade but that 
which arises from the fishing of herrings. It is the 
county town of Argyle. The fishing commonly 
commences in July, and is sometimes continued 
till January. The herrings caught in Loch Fine 
average yearly from 1 5 to 20,000 barrels ; which, 
from their superior quality, are every where pre- 
ferred to the fish of other places. Each boat, of 
which there may be from 3 to 400 employed, has 
four men ; and they have regulations by which they 
are compelled to abide, in regard to their modes of 
fishing, their hours, and their stations. It is 
amusing to go out in the boats when they take up 
their nets, as the brilliant corruscations produced by 
the fish in the water, are exceedingly fine, and will 
appear singular to a stranger. There are no re- 
liques of antiquity here. In the centre of the town 
there is a small pillar to commemorate the assassi- 
nation of some Campbells, in 1685, for their renun- 
ciation of Popery. Guides can readily be procured to 
conduct the stranger through the grounds ; and an 
order for seeing the interior of the castle can be had 
from the chamberlain, who resides in the town.* 

* The numerous parties visiting Inverary, and its environs, 
during the summer and harvest months, cannot be disappoint- 
ed as to natural beauties; but a great cause of complaint form- 
erly arose from the comparative bad state of the inn, with those 
of other places, which subjected visitors to spend as little time 
as possible in that delightful situation ; but the house having 
now gone into other hands, it is hoped the public will find 
more civility and attention, so that it may retrieve its lost re- 
putation. The inconvenience now noticed, has been greatly 
owing ter a mistaken policy in the noble owner, in not allowing 
other inns in the place,— -a competition, so necessary for the 
comfort and protection ot the public from imposition*

same side. Two miles from the sea-lock, on 
the left, is the house of Oakfield, Macneil, sur- 
rounded with wood, and forming one of the 
most delightful places of residence in Argyle- 
shire. In proceeding along, the canal passes 
through an extensive marsh ; and, for some miles, 
nothing interesting is to be seen. On the right is

• This was the first boat of the kind built in the kingdom ; 
and much praise is due to Ma. Henry Bell, of Glasgow , who,

thence to Fort William. The Canal passes along 
the base of the hill, from which, at different places, 
are seen streams that supply it. Five miles on, a 
view of the extensive moss of Crinan, with the ri- 
ver Add running through it ; and the conical hill 
of Dunad, on the top of which are the remains of 
an ancient beacon, or alarm tower. This moss has, 
at some distant period, been covered by the sea, 
the substances under it being wholly marine. 
In many parts of it are tumuli, and numerous 
stones are standing to mark the places where the 
remains of fallen warriors were deposited. Pass'the 
village of Bellanach, from whence the road up the hill 
goes to Keill’s Ferry, distant 12 miles, a regular pas- 
sage to the Islands of Jura and. Islay. Having passed 
along the canal, 9 miles in length, enter Loch Crinan. 
Opposite, on the right, is Duntroon Castle, Malcom ; 
an ancient building, but modernized internally, and 
the occasional residence of its opulent proprietor, 
who has expended a large sum of money in im- 
proving a part of the moss near the castle ; in doing 
which, above 35 miles of open drains have been made. 
Though the neighbouring country is very rugged, 
and the whole surface irregular, it is not deficient 
in picturesque effect ; to which the distant moun- 
tains of Scarba and Jura, with the more remote 
acclivities of Mull, add considerably. From 
Crinan, boats are easily procured, with expert 
hands, for visiting Jura, Scarba, or any of

RAPID TIDES, WHIRLPOOL. 


Crinan in a northerly direction, to the right is 
seen Loch Craignish , in which are several small 
green islands, and at the head of it, Barbreck House, 
General Campbell. On the left are also many isl- 
ands, betwixt one of which and the point of Craig- 
nish, four miles from the canal, the Steam Boat 
passes, the apace being named Dorristmore, the 
great door. During the flood and ebb of the tide, 
particularly in springs, the current is here very rapid, 
being often so strong as to render it impossible for a 
vessel to stem it. All along this coast, up to Fort Wil- 
liam, the tide ismoreor less powerful, according to sit- 
uation, occasioned by the multiplicity of i sl a nds , with 
its vicinity to the Atlantic. In fine weather the 
prospect around, from this point, is very grand. 
To the south, the rugged coast of Knapdale and the 
island of Islandmore ; to the west of whieh is seen, 
dim in the distance, a part of Islay, and nearer the 
bleak shores of Jura, with its fine conical mountains, 
called the Paps, above 2000 feet high. Jura is divid- 
ed from the island of Scarba, placed at its northern 
extremity, by the Gulf of Corryvreckan, a tremen- 
dous whirlpool, like that of Maelstrom, on the coast of 
Norway ; a prince of which country, named Back- 
an, is said to have perished in this Gulf, and hence 
its name. In stream tides, during the flood, ves- 
sels keep at a great distance, lest the tide carry 

them into the vortex: several instances of whieh

have taken place with those pot aware of the dan- 
ger. During a breeze of west wind, with flood 
water, the height to whieh the waves rise ip this 
gulf is terrific. The whirl is supposed to be oc- 
casioned by this opposition, and by some sunk 
rocks that impede the passage of the tide be- 
twixt the two islands. To the north, the high 
mountains of the main land are seen, with the 
intermediate islands of Shuna and JLuing. A short 

days in the neighbourhood, return to Glasgow; and by this 
arrangement accomplish, in four day$ % what formerly was a

way on the right, after leaving the point of 
Craignish , close to the shore, is a part of a 
whin dyke, the stones that compose it being dis- 
tinct from each other, and placed as if by art. 
A mile farther on, is Little Loch Craignish, with the 
ancient Castle of that name on a small eminence ; 
to the right. Loch Milfort, stretching into the coun- 
try for ten miles north-east ; on the same side pass 
the island of Shuna, well wooded ; a small sound 
divides it and the next island, Luing, where se- 
veral slate quarries, belonging to Lord Breadalbane, 
are advantageously wrought In boisterous weather 
the Steam Boat generally takes the sound of Shuna. 
Two nodes from the point of Luing, Blackmill Bay ; 
a safe anchorage, where vessels often wait the turn 
of the tides. Opposite, the island of Lunga. Four 
miles farther north on the left, Belnahuay, also 
a slate island ; to the west of which, the islands 
of Garvallach and Ilachaneuve. Along the shore 
of Lmng, several slate quarries, and the villages 
of the workmen, are to be seen ; and at se- 
veral plaees of the shore there is good anchor- 
age ; at its north end the sound of Cuain, dividing 
it from, the island of Seil ; near a bold point of 


which is Easdale, celebrated for its fine slates, and 
a good harbour. The manner of working this 
quarry is worthy of examination, if the stranger’s 
time will admit of it. From this a boat may be 
hired to go to Iona an$ Staff a, by the south side 
of Mull ; but that is not the course usually taken, 
Being a long and sometimes a boisterous naviga- 
tion. Having left Easdale, the shore is very bold, 
rising perpendicularly from the sea, which here 
generally rolls with a frightful swell, foaming 
against the rocks. A short way on is a curious por- 
tion of a whin dyke, 60 feet high ; on the left is 
the small island of Inch ; and, at a considerable dis- 
tance, is seen the great island of Mull, with its dark 
shores and bleak mountains. Pass the point of Ar-

to the right. Loch Feachan ; at this place is a view 
of the stupendous mountain of Cruachan, distance 
16 miles, with its conical tops, which will be no- 
ticed in our land tour. . Looking back, the sound of 
Clachan separating Seil from the main, with its 
bridge. On the right, at this place, before opening 
the mouth of Loch Feachan, a tremendous slip or dis- 
integration of the hill is seen. Bamacarry, Camp- 
bell. Within Loch Feachan, Kirk and Manse of 
Kilninver. To . the north is the island of Kerrera, 
near the point of which stands a small, beauti- 
ful, and romantic ruin — Goolan Castle ; very well 
worth visiting. Enter the sound of Kerrera , S miles 
on, to the right, Gallanich, M'Dougall ; 2 miles 
more, the Horse Shoe anchorage, where the ships 
of Alexander, king of Scotland, took shelter from 
a storm ; on the shore a hut was erected for the 
monarch, the place being still called, Dallreigh; 
and here he died ; his body was carried . to Mel- 
rose Abbey. Close by, Kerrera Ferry, being the 
established course to Mull, near the farm house of Ar- 
dintrive, and opposite the bay and village of Oban ; 
the shore is semicircular, and the houses placed round 
it look well from the bay. Here is a custom-house 
and post-office. The shores ip the neighbourhood are 
all of brecchia or puddingstone. Upon the shore is a 
small cave, where lately was discovered a quantity | 
of human bones, said to be those of some unfortu- ; 
nate people who took shelter in it during a time 
of famine, and there, perished of want. Oban 
has been pointed out as an elegible situation 
for a naval arsenal, but we cannot see the na- 
tional utility of such an establishment, though we can 
readily believe that some chimerical and self-inter- 
ested individuals wished to betray the government 
into such a ridiculous scheme. The only advan-

tage this place affords is its harbour, but it is 
considered, by mariners, as too deep, having 40 to 
60 fathoms of water ; at stream tides there is a rise 
and fall of 14 feet. From Oban boats are always 
to be hired for conveying strangers to Mull and 
Staffa, or any part of the surrounding country, of 
which we shall afterwards take notice. 

All over this coast, evident marks of the former 
height of the sea may be observed in the formation 
of regular banks, and excavations of the softer 
rocks, of corresponding elevation, and running 
along the shores as far as the eye can carry. In 
leaving the bay of Oban, at its northern entrance 
is a rugged point of brecchia, near which is a 
large portion of the same rock standing on end, and 
named the Dog Stone ; a curious object. At a short 
distance, on a precipitous rock of great elevation, 
stands Dunollie Castle in ruins, originally a Danish 
fort, subsequently a strong hold of the Lords of the 
Isles, andlatterly the residence of Macdougall of Mac- 
dougall. It is a very fine picturesque ruin in eve- 
ry direction from which it is seen ; the walls are of 
great thickness, but were barbarously mutilated by 
the last proprietor, who removed all the freestone 
he could quarry from it, to assist the building of a 
paltry modern house, which is seen near it. Ve- 
nerable by its antiquity, it is somewhat surprising 
that a person still tenacious of the title of chief, 
should destroy the most lasting monument of his 
clan. There is no traditionary history relating to it 
of any consequence ; the name is that of its founder, 
the fort of Ullaus, a Danish commander, in all pro- 
bability. Close by. Maiden Island. Opposite, to

ing the early ages of Caledonian dynasty, and still 
respected as such. Here, it is said, was kept the 
Palladium of Scotland, after it came from Ireland, 
and before it was sent to Scoon, and thence to Lon- 
don ; hence the remark, ubi Palladium., ibi Scotice im- 
perium. This castle is built upon a mass of brecchia 
rock, nearly square, rising abruptly from the plain 
to the height of 80 feet, and inaccessible on any 
side ; the entrance to the castle being by an out- 
side stair, at the top of which was once hung a 
draw-bridge. It is still a royal castle, of which the 
Duke of Argyle is keeper, and was once the resi- 
dence of that family, when Robert the Bruce be- 
sieged and took it. During various civil commo- 
tions it was considered a place of safety, and many 
deeds and charters were consequently lodged in it, 
many of which were never taken away, and are 
still to be seen : some are very old and curious. 
Upon the battlements are placed two long brass 
guns, which were on board the admiral's ship 
of the Spanish Armada, when it was blown up at 
Tobermory, in Mull. Near the castle is an old 
chapel, where is a distinct and singular echo, with 
which many strangers have been surprised. Pass 
the opening to Ardmucknish, or Locknell Bay. 
Have a view of a small hill, on the north side of 
it, where are the remains of a vitrified fort, named 
Berrigonium, erroneously marked in some maps as 
being originally the chief city in Scotland. The 
ferry of Connel is to the right, across Loch Etive, a 
long arm of the sea. In the distance the mountain of 
Cruachan, 3300 feet high, distant about 10 miles;

modem erection on the summit; on the left the 
island of Lismore, wholly a lime rock, but very 
fertile in grain. Near the shore, Kilchiaran, a 
Catholic seminary ; and purchased by the Scot-

proprietors, but principally to Sir John Campbell, 
and Campbell of Barcaldine. On the right, 7 miles

Loch, which name this branch of the sea has for 
some miles above. Near is the island of little Shuna, 
the inner sound or outside of which may be taken. 
To the left the hills and place of Kingarloch, Forbes ; 
a short way from Shuna, Appin House, Downie, from 
the elevated site of which is an extensive view. 
Immediately below this house, on the shore, there 
stands an immense ovate block of micaceous granite, 
above 30 feet in circumference. It is curiously placed, 
as if by art, upon three small stones about 1 2 inches 
from the ground. It may be difficult to account for 
such a phenomenon, there being no rocks of si- 
milar formation within many miles of the place. 
Several farm houses are seen on both sides. Five 
miles from Appin House, the point of Ardsheal, and 
house of same name, Stewart. Near to this there 
has lately been discovered a mineral spring, much 
resorted to for medical purposes. The proprietor is 
erecting an inn and some houses near the place, for 
the accommodation of invalids. Close by is a fine 
cave, protected by a water-fall, which conceals 
the mouth of it; after the commotions of 1 7 45, 
many people took refuge in it, from the oppressive 
persecutions of the successful military. Opposite, the

patches of ground with cottages thereon, called 
Crofts, lined off on the side of the hill. A portion of 
the mountain of Bennevis, the highest in Great Bri- 
tain, is in view a great part of the way from Corran ; 
about 10 miles distant from which is Fort William. 
Here Locheil, which till now runs in a northerly 
course, turns suddenly to the left, taking a direction 
to the west. Fort William, which now appears, isbut 
a small place, of consequence only from its custom- 
house and garrison. It is, properly speaking, called

grandeur is to be contemplated ; and if the stran- 
ger is to be captivated with nature in her boldest 
form, it is here that his eye will have full enjoy-

well as strength of mind, to support him, in so very 
arduous an undertaking, and to render him steady 
in many perilous situations to which he may be 
exposed, ought not to make the attempt ; for no 
stranger can have the most distant notion of the dif- 
ficulty. But if his strength and courage enable 
him to surmount it, and that he arrives at the sum- 
mit of the mountain, with a clear atmosphere, and 
a telescope in his possession, he will have a view 
which no pencil can delineate, nor language de- 
clare. Placed on a pinnacle, to which there is no 
parallel in Britain, the mind is lost in the multifa- 
rious objects, and the extent of view on all sides. 
The world is beneath his feet, and its highest hills 
appear as pigmies of an inferior creation. Here 
the prospect is across the kingdom, from the Ger- 
man ocean and the Murray Frith on one side, to 
the Atlantic on the other ; the dim shores of Caith- 
ness, and the far receding capes of Ireland, close in 
the immense expanse ; while an infinite number of 
intermediate arms of the sea, and fresh water lakes, 
intersect the land in all directions, and form a com- 
bination not less beautiful and interesting than it is 
sublime and wonderful. 

The garrison of Fort William is situated near the 
confluence of the river Lochy with the sea, where 
there is a considerable salmon-fishing. Two miles 
from it, upon the bank of the river, stand the ruins 
of Inverlocky Castle, one of the more ancient for- 
tresses of the Highlands ; and from its situation 
amidst fierce and turbulent clans, was often the 
posture of misrule and blood ; and latterly, in 
17 46, it was the witness of more barbarity and 
massacre, indiscriminately exercised on the in-

nocent' and helpless, than had ever before dis- 
graced any period of the mountains. A short 
way above this castle is a ferry across the ri- 
ver, and a road that leads along the border of an 
extensive moss, to the sea-lock of the Caledonian 
Canal, at Corpach ;* close to which is the church 
of Kilmallie, in the cemetery of which are the re- 
mains of Colonel Cameron, of the 92 d regiment, 
who fell at Waterloo, on whose tomb is a laboured 
epitaph, by a living poet, who has acquired no or- 
dinary degree of fame and fortune by his writings. 

If the tourist inclines to visit the Isle of Skye, 
and its celebrated Spar Cave, he is now on the di- 
rect road to it ; described in the next section.

Should the traveller be unwilling to undertake 
the fatigue of walking, horses can be hired at 
Fort William. Leaving Corpach, which is 4 miles 
from the former, soon pass Annet ; &amp; miles forward,

• The Caledonian Canal extends from this place to the east* 
ern sea, but is not yet completed. The intention is to cut off 
the long navigation through the Pentland Frith and the West- 
ern Islands . It is wholly carried on at the expence of Go- 
vernment ; and though it appears a chimerical undertaking, has 
benefited the working community, but not so as to prevent 
emigration from the Highlands; under which impression 
it was originally projected. A considerable part of the 
course is through a natural chain of fresh-water lakes, which 
form the greater proportion of the distance; and during this 
season, it is understood that steam vessels are to be provided 
for navigating this canal, and the lakes connected with it ; so 
that travellers will then go from Glasgow to Inverness, by 
thii track, in less than three days.

lake of 30 miles. It was some time ago proposed 
to form a canal from Locheil to Lochsheal, to facili- 
tate the passage of vessels going to the herring fish- 
ing 1 . Boats are often dragged across this neck of land 
from one to the other, which saves a passage of 130 
miles. Few situations are more secluded and wild 
than this part of Glenfinan. Here did the unfortunate 
Prince Charles Stewart meet his friends, and first 
unfurl his standard on the 19th of August, 1745, 
when he went forth on the romantic scheme of re- 
claiming the crown of his ancestry. On the spot 
where that was done, the late Macdonald of Glena~ 
ladale erected an obelisk in commemoration of 
the event, many of his relations having bled among 
the misguided partisans of the cause. That unhap- 
py trial was instituted by some inconsiderate men, 
who believed, as the Highlanders, for a series of 
more than 300 years, revered the line of Stewart 
princes, that they would arise to a man in support 
of their claim to the British throne. This convic- 
tion had been forcibly impressed upon the mind of 
the Prince himself, else he never would have made 
the trial to overturn the government without the 
requisite means, or any organized plan of opera- 
tion; and the sequel proved the error of the at- 
tempt. Jealous of each other’s importance, and 
unaccustomed to regular subordination, the chief- 
tains who espoused his claim, could not act in concert. 
Disputes and disunion thence arose ; and at the cri- 
tical moment, when unanimous exertion could alone 
save their cause, a strange fatality took possession of 
them, and by mere indifference in some, and per- 
haps wilful negligence in others, their ill-managed 
army was overthrown ; and they, their relations, 
and friends, involved in a course of misery, from the 
baneful effects of which, many have not to this hour 
got free. Charles himself, an early fugitive from 
the scene of his discomfiture, took shelter among 
the dreary heaths and rugged crags of the moun- 
tains ; and though myriads of soldiers were perpe-

tually in search of him, and high rewards offered 
for his discovery, yet he was concealed from his 
foes, as if by the immediate interposition of Provi- 
dence : and after wandering for many months, suf- 
fering under the most dreadful privations, he at last 
effected his escape, to the eternal honour of those 
Highlanders who accompanied him during his ha- 
rassing and hazardous concealment. 

This road is what has been denominated a Parlia- 
mentary road, a grant of half the outlay in making 
it having been given by Government. It is an ex- 
cellent road, and will surprise the traveller that the 
formation of such was practicable through so for- 
bidding and rugged a surface, the like of which is 
no where to be met with. Several miles are 
travelled without seeing a hut, until the head of 
Loch Eyelort appears, deep in a glen, at which 
is a farm house, and a little farther on, a small inn, 
where sometimes com may be procured for a horse ; 
but where, it is believed, good whisky can at all 
times be had, which, after so tedious a journey, may 
not be considered despicable. The road makes nu- 
merous turns, which, from the inconceivable irre- 
gularity of the country, was unavoidable. About 
15 miles from Glenfinan, on the left, near a small 
lake, is Arisaig House, Macdonald, a modem build- 
ing in the cottage style ; 2 miles farther, Borrodale, 
Macdonald, close to the road ; and 2 miles more, 
the Village and Inn of Arisaig, with its Catholic 

chapel. This stands on the border of Loch-na - 

* 

Nuaghy — Loch of Caves. Here Prince Charles 
Stewart landed from the ship that conveyed him 
from France, and took up his residence at Borro- 
dale. The natives point out the rock on which he 
stepped from the boat ; and it is still venerated with 
feelings of respect. It was at Borrodale also that 
he took refuge after his defeat at Culloden, and 
when exhausted in strength and means, after many 
surprising escapes, while wandering through the 
mountains to avoid his enemies.

ISLE OF SKYE. 


35 


From the neighbourhood of Arisaig there is a 
regular ferry to Ardavaser, in Skye, or a boat may 
be procured to go directly by sea, round the Point 
of Sleat into Loch Slapin , to visit the Spar Cave. 
The tourist will do well, however, not to allow him- 
self to be imposed upon, as the boatmen at all the 
ferries are much disposed to take advantage of 
strangers, particularly if they go out of their usual 
course. The Point of Sleat is nearly west of Ari- 
saig ; and if a water trip be preferred, the distance 
will be about 25 miles to the Cave ; but if the 
wind be not favourable, or if the weather be calm, 
the passage may be tedious, in which case it will 
be better to land at Ardavaser, 12 miles across, andgo 
from thence by land. At the landing place of Ar- 
davasar, in Skye, there is no inn, so that the stran- 
ger must proceed some distance, before he can have 
such accommodation. Close to the road, 2 miles for- 
ward, is the mansion of Lord Macdonald, chiefly 
built of marble, in which Skye abounds. This is also 
a government road, lately finished ; in passing along 
which, is a fine, picturesque, and striking view of the 
mainland mountains around Lochs Nevis and Hourn, 
called Knoydart. Three miles on, the Church of 
Sleat, where is the monument of the great Sir 
James Macdonald ; 3 miles farther on the right, 
the House and ancient Castle of Knock. The road 
here loses sight of the sea ; and about 6 miles more 
arrives at the village of Cambuscross, on the bay of 
Isle Oronsay, a safe and good, anchor age for vessels 
in stormy weather, or while waiting a turn of the 
tide in Kyle Rhea, a narrow passage betwixt Skye 
a n d the mainland. From Cambuscross the road 
passes through an extensive muir, and at 8 miles 
distance comes in sight of the sea. To the right 
will be seen the new fishing village of Kylehackan ; 
at a considerable distance. Loch Carron, on the 
mainland, dividing the counties of Inverness and 
Ross ; and, stretching to the north, the bleak shores 
of the latter jutting out by different headlands

into the sea. In front the islands of Scalpa and 
Raasay ; and on the left, the huge dark mountain 
of Bencallaich ; at the base of which, 4 miles more, 
is the village and inn of Broadford ; near which is 
Corrychattachan, M'Kinnon. From this the road to 
the district of Strathaird, in which the cave is situated, 
strikes offby an unmade track from the new line of 
road ; and here the stranger should procure a guide, 
as the path is not so well marked that it can be 
safely pursued, particularly at the head of Loch Sla- 
pin, 6 miles distant, at the influx of the river, and 
where the tide overflows the flat, which is cut up 
into hollows, and full of swamps. The road, 
goes along considerable beds of marble, but is 
still very bad, and from the head of Loch Slapin to 
Kilmoree is most wretched indeed. From Broad- 
ford to Kilmoree is 10 miles; but the cave is 
yet 4 miles farther, and it will be advis- 
able to go by water. It will save time and la- 
bour considerably, if the stranger, instead of 
going round the head of the loch, hires a boat 
at a farm on the north side of Loch Slapin, 
from which he can go directly to the cave. It is 
better, if suitable, to get there at high water, be- 
cause when the tide is low, it is of more difficult 
access. The shore of Strathaird is an almost un- 
broken line of perpendicular rock, composed of ar- 
gillaceous sandstone, of regular horizontal stratifi- 
cation, but divided by innumerable perpendicular 
fissures, many of which are filled with trap of va- 
rious thickness, and constitute the secondary for- 
mation of whin dykes. The entrance to the Cave 
from the sea is peculiarly striking ; the rock is se- 
parated, as if to form a street of 500 feet in length, 
and above 30 in breadth, while on each side it is 
about 1 00 feet high. The Cave, it will be observed,

is upon the west side of Loch Slapin , and the en- 
trance to it takes the same direction. It is possible 
to get here by land, but we would advise the 
course by water* as more easy and striking. A

gradual ascent from the water’s edge, which, at low 
ebb, is rather difficult, brings the tourist to the 
mouth of the Cave, a wild portal, resembling 
an artificial Gothic arch, opening to a passage 
silent and dismal, into which the sun’s light 
has never entered, and where darkness holds 
her solitary and cheerless reign. To explore this 
cavity the light of torches or candles is necessary, 
and with these the visitors must be provided. The 
passage from the mouth of the Cave is 9 feet broad, 
and from 15 to 20 feet high, and level for 60 feet, 
when it begins to ascend by a steep pathway for 
55 feet more ; here there is a flat of some feet, 
where the stranger may stand a few minutes to 
breathe before he goes farther. To this part of 
the passage the walls and top of it are black, and 
the rock bare. But the next ascent of 28 feet sud- 
denly assumes the appearance of a snowy congela- 
tion, or that of a solid cascade, which is scrambled 
over with considerable difficulty. The irregulari- 
ty of this pass will allow of some leisure to exa- 
mine the sides of it, which now begin to show the 
splendid nature of the cavity. Having attained 
the summit of this path, the breadth is 8 feet, 
with a vaulted roof 12 feet high ; but of suchmar- 
morean whiteness that dazzles the eye. All around 
is now shining spar, the right side of this arch 
being sustained by an admirable Gothic column of 
regular form, projecting from the side three-fourths 
of its circumference. Proceeding along this vesti- 
bule for 35 feet, the sides are adorned with beau- 
tiful incrustations of various forms, w hile from the 
roof is suspended icicles of spar. This passage is 
nearly horizontal, and gradually enlarges to 10 
feet in width, and 40 in height. Suddenly the 
stranger is ushered into a magnificent theatre, as it 
were, wholly composed of sparkling gems and 
white shining spar ; and, upon looking forward, he 
will observe that the space is abruptly extended to 
20 feet in breadth, of a shape nearly circular ; the

bottom of which is filled with water, resembling an 
immense white marble bath, the whole being sur- 
rounded with beautiful white spar, thrown into 
hundreds of grotesque figures, and the roof orna- 
mented with innumerable stalactites of different 
sizes. An opening on the opposite side of the 
pool is supported by two admirable pillars, espe- 
cially that on the right, which is more like the 
work of art, than the fortuitous operation of incrus- 
tation. From the roof there is a constant drop- 
ping of water, and the surface of the spar i§ every 
where suffused with moisture, which will account 
for the manner in which this magnificent cave has 
been formed. Though a visit to this cave be ra-r 
ther an arduous undertaking, the traveller of 
taste will not consider his time mispent ; even 
die gloomy mountains of Cuthullin, that rise 
in majesbc grandeur to the south of this cave, 
are objects not unworthy of observation, not. only 
from their altitude, but from their being the 
ground over which the mighty hero of the Celtic 
bard, whose name they bear, often pursued the 
stag, and upon their cloudy summits held his 
aerial feast of shells.*

stranger to Oban, by the now usual conveyance of 
a Steam Boat, we would recommend that village as 
the most convenient place on the mainland for 
taking a vessel or boat to any of the Western 
Islands. During the season when travellers com- 
monly visit the islands, boats are always to be 
had at Oban, either to carry passengers to the nearest 
landing place in the Island of Mull, or to convey 
them along the sound of that island as far as Aros. 

Should the traveller go by the regular fer- 
ries, the first is about about 2 miles south- 
west of Oban, which crosses a narrow sound to 
the Island of Kerr era; and after a walk of 3 miles 
to the other side of that island, the next ferry 
crosses to Loch Bon, in Mull, a breadth of 9 
miles. Near the landing place in Mull, there is 
an inn; but it seldom happens that horses can 
be procured, though, for the most part a man or 
boy may be got, to carry a portmanteau; yet 
in this country, as well as all others, strangers 
must guard against imposition, whenever the 
services of the commonalty are required. Loch 
Bon is a safe anchorage for vessels of any size, 
and is often resorted to when winds or tides are 
unfavourable. From Loch Bon there is a road 
along the coast of Mull. A mile distant is Ach- 
nacraig, formerly the inn, Campbell ; 2 miles on 
is a bridge across the upper part of Loch Bon; 
and a little farther, is seen to the right, Castle 
Buart, a very ancient fortress of the Macleans. 
From different parts of the road, some fine 
and very extensive prospects of the mainland 
mountains are to be seen ; and we will venture 
to say, that a more extraordinary combination of 
irregularity, than this scene affords, can no where 
else be beheld in the three kingdoms; for it 
comprehends, besides the stupendous elevations of 
Bennevis, Cruachan, and Bennahua, the great 
mountains of Lorn, Appin, part of Inverness-shire, 
Ardgour, Morvern, and Mull; forming such a group.

and such immense masses, as must astonish and 
delight every beholder. One mile farther, to J 
the right, is Achnacroish, Campbell ; and 1 mile 
more, the church of Craigenuir. On the opposite 
side of the sound, on the mainland, is seen the 1 
coast of Morvem ; 3 miles forward, Scalastle 
Hotise and Bay. Along the road several fine views 
of the sound are to be seen ; 5 miles on, 

close to the road, some curious formation of rock; 1 
and near this, the ancient chapel of Pennygown, 
still used as a burying place, but without any 
enclosure, — a shameful degree of negligence, al- 
most universal over the Highlands. Indeed, 
in some parishes, the church-yard is the site of 
the markets, where horses, cattle, and all kinds 
of merchandise are exposed to sale ; and where 
the boisterous revelry of intoxication is too of- 
ten exhibited. Strange it is that the Highlanders, 
a people so tenacious of their heroic ancestry, and 
so reverential to the manes of their fathers, should 
so far seem to disregard such feelings, as to al- 
low the receptacles of their dead to be so wanton- 
ly polluted ; but, in suffering such unhallowed 
sacrilege to go on, we conceive the clergy are 
reprehensible, because a positive act of Parlia- 
ment entitles them to have their parochial ceme- 
teries enclosed. 

Near this chapel is the house of Pemy- 
gotvn, M'Quarrie ; and a short way on, Callachilly, 
M'Lean ; 1 mile further, the church of Salen ; S 
miles more, on the left, Achdashenaig, Stewart; 
and on the opposite side, the house and ruinous 
castle of Aros.

On leaving Oban bay, on the right, Dunnollie 
Castle. From this to the opening of the sound 
of Mull, the course is nearly west, distant 1 2 miles. 
In passing the channel, the mountains noticed in the 
former section are to be seen. The island of Lismore 
for some time is opposite ; but after entering the 
sound of Mull, it lies to the right; on the left 
Loch Don. Near the point of Lismore , during ebb 
water, is seen the Lady Rock , so named from the 
cruelty of a Maclean of Duart castle ; who, in 
order to get quit of his consort, caused her to be 
placed on the rock at low water, that she might 
perish with the return of flood ; but he was dis- 
appointed, for the lady was rescued by a boat 
accidentally passing, and restored to her friends 
at Inverary castle. Her inhuman husband, sup- 
posing her to be drowned, after a mock funeral, 
went to Inverary to condole with her father, then 
Earl of Isla, and when her friends were assem- 
bled with him in the dinner-room, the lady of 
Duart also appeared, to the no small surprise and 
consternation of her husband. He was permitted 
to leave the house unmolested ; but her brother 
followed him and put him to death. This tradi- 
tion forms the ground- work of Miss Baillie s play 
of the Family Legend. A short way on, to the 
left, is Duart Castle , boldly seated on a rock, in 
a commanding situation ; it is a fine ruin, and, 
with its ivy-mantled walls, forms a very strik- 
ing and romantic object from the sea, when com- 
bined with the surrounding prospect. During the

existence of clanship, it was the frequent scene of 
discord ; and, like every ancient fortress in the 
Highlands, numerous interesting incidents of lo- 
cal history are connected with it. The building 
is of Danish origin. Close to it is a bay of the 
same name ; on the opposite side of which, is 
Achnacroish . To the right is the opening of Linnhe 
Loch , separating the island of Lismore from the 
mainland of Morvern. On the north side of Lis- 
more is the ruined Castle of Achendoun ; and fur- 
ther off, on the Morvern shore, is Glensanda Castle , 
also in ruins. More near, likewise on the right, is 
the rugged point of Ardenrider y from which

ter the expulsion of that people ; and from its pecu- 
liar advantages, situated on a point of land easily de- 
fended, and readily communicating with their other 
possessions, on either hand, it was often the recep- 
tacle of their numerous vassals, assembled to re- 
ceive their arbitrary laws ; to be marshalled for the 
field ; to display the pomp of lordly power, and the 
dignity of their elevated rank. Above the castle is 
the house of Ardtornishy Gregorson. Farther on 
is the entrance to Loch Auline, an arm of the 
sea, running into the mainland about 4 miles ; 
at the extremity is the ancient castle of that 
name, also a ruin ; which, with the loch, skirted 
with copse- wood, is worthy of examination. 

Nearly opposite to Ardtornishy is Scalastle, or 
Macalisters Bay ; a good anchorage. In pass- 
ing along, on the right, the church of Kelly and 
several farm houses; on the left. Penny gown and 
C all a chilly ; on going into Aros bay, Killvndine 
Castle, on the right ; and at some distance, along 
the sound, the hills of Ardnamurchan . The cas- 
tle of Aros was another princely residence of the 
Lords of the Isles ; and during the period of their 
bold independence, was the frequent seat of their 
councils, as well as the security of their persons. 
Here Robert the Bruce, after his final establish- 
ment on the Scottish throne, paid a visit to the then 
Lord of the Isles; and there is still extant, a charter, 
dated at Aros, and signed by Robert, bestowing 
upon one of Macdonald's vassals, who had assisted 
at Bannockburn, certain lands in Ardnamurchan . 
At Aros there is a small inn ; but, in the High- 
lands, travellers are not to expect the same com- 
fortable lodgings, and sumptuous treatment, as will 
be found on the roads in England, and south of 
Scotland. 

From Aros guides can be procured to direct 
the traveller towards the celebrated Basaltic Island 
of Staffa , and its magnificent Cave ; and he may 
either get a horse, or may walk to the head of

STAFFA. 


Loch-na-Keal, a distance of 3£ miles, where, in 
general, a boat and hands can be hired. Here, 
indeed, there is no inn ; but by going down the 
north side of the Loch, and passing several farm 
steads, there is an inn at Ulva. Near the head 
of this loch are Groolin and, Knock ; behind which 
rise some of the great mountains of Mtdl: Ben- 
more and Mamclachaig, where the deer browse in 
security, and the black-cock and grouse associate 
in numerous covies. Ulva is an island, 6 miles 
from the loch end ; and here, in the season when 
travellers’are expected to come, boats and hands are 
always in readiness. Near the inn, Ulva Home, 
Macdonald. The boatmen are judges of the weather 
when it is safe and practicable to reach Staffa; 
and, should the stranger forget it, they will put 
him in mind of taking some provender for the 
voyage, which commonly occupies, if Iona be in- 
cluded, a whole day ; and it is a good day’s work 
too. Staffa is computed to be about 9 miles from 
Ulva, due south-west. Several islands are seen in 
rowing along, with the names of which the boat- 
men are acquainted. In nearing the island of Staf- 
fa, its columnar formation gradually becomes visi- 
ble. Towards the south it appears abrupt and pre- 
cipitous; and when within 2 or 300 yards, where the 
mouth of the cave opens, the eye is rivetted upon 
the spot, until the boat approaches close to it, when 
the beholder is, for some time either lost in silent 
admiration and wonder, or utters some involuntary 
ejaculation expressive of his feelings : for, to convey 
a just idea of the extraordinary sublimity of the 
mouth of this cave, language has not force; nor 
can any painting give an adequate degree of effect 
to its grandeur. To conceive any thing so extraordi- 
nary as the construction of Fingal’s Cave, as it is 
absurdly denominated, is beyond the powers of the 
most comprehensive or fertile imagination. The 
mouth of the cave is about 70 feet high, and 
about 35 broad, running back for 150 feet; but

, gradually diminishing in breadth to its termina- 
tion. It is wholly formed of basaltic perpendi- 
cular pillars, from 5 to 8 sides, closely compacted 
into each other, and accurately fitted. The top 
and bottom are composed of the same pillars, 
broken off, the upper ones corresponding with 
those below. The sea flows in the whole length 
of the cave, and boats can go to the end. On 
each side several of the columns have been broken, 
and what remain now form a footing, by which 
visitors can pass near to the extremity of the cave. 
On the right side, at the entrance, are broken 
columns, at the base of those that remain entire, 
which gradually descend, like steps of a stair, into 
the water. From the constant swell of the sea 
round this island, even in the calmest weather, it 
is difficult to land upon it. On different parts of 
the shore, the perpendicular form has been altered, 
and the pillars are thrown into some distortions, 
and different degrees of curvation, yet still keep- 
ing the regular shape of the pillars. The isl- 
and of Staffa is about 1 mile in length ; and 
round its whole circumference is made up of 
considerable portions of basalt. From the top of 
the island many others are to be seen, the most re- 
markable of which is that called the Dutchman’s 
Cap, to the north ; and others curiously formed. 
At some distance is Coll ; and still farther north, the 
great mountains of Skye, though dim in the hori- 
zon, may be traced. To Iona the course is south, 
distant about 12 miles. In this navigation, which 
is exposed to the full reach of the Atlantic, there 
is generally a great swell of the sea ; but it is, 
at the same time, perfectly safe. On landing in 
Iona, strangers are beset with the natives, who 
offer for sale a coarse species of pebble, rounded 
by attrition. The schoolmaster of the place is 
the only one in the island who can speak the 
English language, and he is the proper person to 

point out the antiquities of the place. The buildings

are said to have owed their foundation to St. Co* 
luxnba, an Irish Religieuse, who had fled in dis- 
gust from his native country ; first settled in the 
island of Oronsay, from which, as he could see 
Ireland, he set up his abode in Iona , to fulfil a 
vow, that he would never again look upon that 
country. This is said to have taken place in the 6tb 
century ; and, from being the residence of this holy 
man, was named after him, Icolumkill, the island 
of Cdumba’s Cell. It is not, however, probable 
that the buildings in this island were founded at 
so early a period, as the use of stone and lime 
was not resorted to in Scotland for more than 300 
years after that period. Certain it is, at all events, 
that the place has ever since been considered of 
great sanctity, for in it many of the early and 
latter Scottish monarchs were interred ; and many 
ancient tombstones are still very entire, and af- 
ford matter of much pleasant reflection to the curi- 
ous in such researches. The architecture of the 
buildings is in no other way remarkable than 
that they were erected in so remote a situation, 
at a period so distant ; and that they were sure- 
ly of importance in a religious point of view, as 
Johnson, appositely observes: "whence savage 

clans, and roving barbarians, derived the first prin- 
ciples of Christian faith.” From Iona the islands 
of Colonsay , and the west sides of Jura and Scarba 
are to be seen. It is divided from Ross, a point 
of Mull, by a narrow and shallow sound. In 
returning from it, to the right, is Loch Scridan ; 
to the west of which is the bold and rugged 
point of Gribon ; about 8 miles from which is 
a very large cave called Mackmon’s. The entrance 
is from the water’s edge, and the bottom perfectly 
level, being formed of sea sand. Within, it is on- 
ly remarkable for its great height and extent. A 
mile farther, pass Inch Kenneth, on which the ruins 
of an old chapel ; and near it the remains of a 
former residence of a knight of the Macleans. From

FROM GLASGOW TO CAMPBELTON. 




BY THE KYLES OF BUTE, 96 m.— AND BY THE 

SOUTH OF BUTE AND NORTH OF ARRAN, £)f&gt; HI. 

In our first section we have noticed the course 
of the Steam Boats from Glasgow through the 
Kyles of Bute ; and as in going to Campbelton the 
same track is generally pursued, we refer the reader 
to that part as far as the western opening of the 
Kyles, at the Point of Airdlamont, from which the 
boats bear across the mouth of Lochfyne, in a direc- 
tion nearly due west, to the point of Skipness, in 
Kintyre, a distance of 12 miles. To the left the 
mountains of Arran are distinctly seen, towering in 
all their ruggedness to the clouds, and exhibiting 
proofs of violent convulsion, in their formation; 
with subsequent influence of the weather, which, 
if they ever had any, has now denuded their stony 
pinnacles of every covering, where even the hardy 
eagle, who delights in barren wildness, can scarcely 
find shelter for her brood. The sides of those 
mountains are striated, and rendered still more 
frightful by the numerous chasms cut into them by 
the rapid cataracts that dash through them during 
the long continued rains of the climate ; which,

from the vicinity of this island to the Atlantic, and 
its extreme altitude, is a natural disadvantage not 
to be overcome ; and which, of course, renders the 
west coast not so favourable for the cultivation of j 
crops as for the rearing of cattle. Near the point j 
of Arran is seen Loch Ranza, and opposite is that i 
of Skipness. The boat now enters the Sound of 
KUbrannan. Near to the point of Skipness is its 
ancient castle, and modem house, Campbell ; 3 miles 
forward, the Church and Parsonage. The houses ■ 
of different proprietors, occur along the shore, 
viz. 6 miles farther, Cour, McAlister, Torrisdale 
Castle, late General McAlister, a modern cas- 
tle; 8 miles more, Carradale, Campbell; 5 miles, 
Saddel, Campbell ; 7 miles, Ardnacross, M‘Neill ; 
and 7 miles more, Campbelton. This loch is pro- 
tected by an island, named Islandavar, and is a safe 
anchorage for vessels. The southern channel of 
this island was at one time navigable ; but is now 
become very shallow, and will probably soon form 
a land passage to it, being gradually filling up with ' 
sand washed in from the sea. The entrance to it 

{ 

is very fine and romantic, and the town, as seen 
from the opening of the loch, has a pleasing ap- i 
pearance. In the town there is nothing to be 
seen; but the inhabitants are attentive to stran- 
gers, and the neighbouring country well culti- 
vated and enclosed. Coal is obtained at a short 
distance, and brought to the town by a small ca- 
nal; but the quality is bad. If a stranger has 
time, he will find amusement in the vicinity, should 
he have the good fortune of being introduced to 
any of the gentlemen of the place. In particular, 
he should visit the Southend of Kintyre, towards the I 
Moil, the bold, and for vessels, the dangerous head- 
land of the peninsula, 1 3 miles from Campbelton. 
The etymology of Kintyre is abundantly appro- 
priate : Cean Tire, in the Celtic dialect, being 
the head of the country. At Campbelton the 
head inn is kept by M'Naughton, who is very

i obliging and attentive to his guests. Conve- 
nient jaunting cars and gigs can be hired, on 
moderate terms. Leaving the town, several farm 
houses are to be seen on both sides the road; 
and at some distance, on the right, the house 
of Losset, M/Neill ; and, 1 1 miles further, the 
Church and Manse of Southend ; near which is 
the ferry to Ballycastle, in Ireland. Here stands 
the rock on which once was placed the castle of 
Dunavartich , or the Fort of Murder ; so named 
from a foul breach of faith in the Campbells, who 
massacred about 200 Macdonalds, to whom the 
district of Kintyre then belonged, and who took 
refuge in this castle, after the Campbells, by an 
unjust commission of fire and sword, had wrested 
from them their lawful inheritance. There is now 
scarcely one stone remaining above another ; razed 
to so pitiable a humiliation, it is supposed, by the 
blushing successors of the murderers, who proba- 
bly believed, that by the entire destruction of the 
fortress, so would be forgotten the bloody deed 
that produced its demolition. Near this melan- 
choly shore are several romantic caves of great ex- 
tent, also said to have been receptacles of outlawed 
banditti, who favoured the Campbells in their san- 
guinary attack. Certain, however, it is, that since 
then the murderers have given place to merry 
bands of tinkers from Ireland, as well as to jol- 
ly hordes of smugglers from that dear country. 

Though the Steam Boats commonly go to 
Campbelton by the Kyles of Bute, as being a 
less boisterous passage, they frequently, in calm 
weather, take the south of that island, going 
round what is called the Garroch Head. In 
this track, having left that already described 
at Towart Point, the first object on the Isl- 
and of Bute is Askaig, McArthur, on the right; 
and a short way on. Mount Stewart, the fine re- 
sidence of the Marquis of Bute. Passing along

FROM GLASGOW TO THE ISLAND OF ARRAN, 

65 miles. 

The natural history of the island of Arran hav- 
ing lately excited philosophical attention, we are 
induced to give a short outline of the principal sub- 
jects of mineralogical curiosity which it contains ; 
though such researches are pursued with considera- 
ble labour, from the great irregularity and general 
ruggedness of the surface. 

In the first section, the course of the Steam 
Boats is pointed out to Rothesay, at which place, 
or by walking to the southwest side of Bute, boats 
can be had for crossing to Arran, as the Steam 
Boats, in passing it, either to CampbeUon or Belfast, 
do not touch on any part of it. Leaving the isl- 
and of Bute, a fine view of Arran is presented to 


* la going from Glasgow to CampbeUon, the greater part of 
the day is taken up. When the Steam Boats leave Glasgow 
on Friday, it is not unusual for them to visit the Craig of 
Ailm, on the following day, and return to CampbeUon at night. 
This rack is opposite to the town of Girvan, on the coast of 
■Ayrt and is seen at a great distance, being 940 feet of almost 
perpendicular height, rising abruptly from the sea. Visitors of- 
ten land upon it, and scramble up a hazardous path to a consi- 
derable height, where stands the ruin of an old tower, said to 
have been built by Philip the II. of Spain ; but for what pur- 
pose erected in that place, is difficult to learn. This rock is 
inhabited by myriads of sea fowl, that nestle among the rocky 
crevices ; and are sometimes seen in such immense clouds, 
when upon wing, as to darken the sun.

the eye. It appears wholly to be made up of 
enormous black mountains, frowning over the low- 
er countries with sullen grandeur, and tower ing to 
the sky in pre-eminent exultation. The mountain 
of Goatfield seems quite close, from its great 
altitude, being 3297 feet high ; and the internal 
scenery, of the island, though wild in the ex- 
treme, at the same time possesses much grandeur, 
from the great elevation of its mountains and cliffs, 
and their numerous debris fallen into the plains, and 
along the shores, in enormous masses. Arran , 

which signifies high island, is 32 miles long, and 1 2 
broad. Towards the north it is very rugged, im- 
mense mountains being closely grouped ; among 
which, is Goatfield, erroneously changed from the 
Gaelic etymology, which is Gaobh bein, mountain of 
winds. Broddick Bay is the nearest, and, perhaps, 
the most convenient landing place ; but there is no 
proper inn on the island, which is to be regretted, as 
those who admire the wonderful and sublime in 
nature, would, in this island, have much gratifica- 
tion. On the north of the bay is the ancient castle 
of Arran or Broddick, still in part occupied, and a 
fine situation it is, commanding a very extensive 
prospect. It is placed on a rocky bank rising from 
the sea, and consists of a high quadrangular tower, 
of gloomy exterior. It is partly surrounded with 
a thick wall. Oliver Cromwell had it fortified in 
a very strong manner. Eighty men, whom he had 
sent for its defence, having committed some out- 
rages in the island, were beset by the natives, and 
murdered. To the south, Goatfield rises rapidly. 
The body of this mountain is granite ; but that 
is covered with other masses, such as sandstone, 
basalt, schistus, and brecchia, variously disposed. 
The granite is composed of chrystalized fel-spar, 
commonly whitish, and in which silica is interspers- 
ed, and a small proportion of talc. In its vicinity 
there are several glens, running in different direc- 
tions, where the stratification of the rock can be

examined, and where many substances of mineralo- 
gical interest are to be had, viz. pitchstone, V&gt;a&lt;ah, 
sienites, porphyry, schistus, granite, brecchia, and 
lime. On the southern shoulder of this mountain 
is a curious Druidical altar. It is a parallel ogra- 
mic piece of granite of vast dimensions, fourteen 
inches thick, placed horizontally upon other blocks 
of stone, which must have required immense force 
and ingenuity to have effected. In Glen Rosa 
there are several ancient cairns and obelisks, left to 
commemorate some event long since out of memo- 
ry. In a chasm, formed by a fall on the river 
Rosa, is a curious formation of two granitic veins, 
in a perpendicular position, parallel to each other, 
and inserted exactly in the centre of a whinstone 
vein, and standing four feet out of the water. To- 
wards the north of the island is the Cock, an im- 
mense block of sandstone, that has received that 
name from its resemblance to the head of that ani- 
mal. Near this, within tide mark, is a singular ar- 
rangement of indurated clay, resembling Mosaic 
pavement. It consists of equilateral pieces of flo- 
rid red clay hardened to the consistency of brick, 
running parallel to each other; and these are 
crossed by other straight and parallel lines, with 
mathematical accuracy. Each rhomb is 14 inches 
broad, and that of the separating medium, half 
an inch, the colour of which is reddish, inclining to 
white, and is harder than the former. This equals, 
in regularity, the most perfect work of art, and is 
no less beautiful than some of the ancient Mosaic 
pavements of Rome. Here are numerous masses 
of sandstone and breccliia that have tumbled from 
the mountains. A short way from this is a pro- 
digious stratum of brecchia fractured to pieces, ' 
and rolled towards the shore, the effect of an 
intense frost some years since; the tremendous 
crash of which was heard' at the distance of many 
miles. This shore, for a great way, is an alternation 
of sandstone and schistus, the former, in many places,

assuming a regular aspect, as if the work of art. 
On a peninsula in Loch Ranza, are the remains of an 
ancient castle of that name, built by one of the Scot- 
tish kings before 1380, and occupied by them as a 
hunting seat. It has been very magnificent when en- 
tire- Near Loch Ranza, farther north, an interesting 
geological phenomena is to be seen — the junction of 
primary and secondary strata of sandstone, lime, and 
micaceous schistus, incumbent on a vein of basalt. 
Higher up the glen from this loch, the mountains 
of granite are covered with schistus ; but wonderful 
diversity takes place in the mixture of the rocks 
that compose those eminences. Close to this is the base 
of Camie-na-Callich, a mountain, whose elevation is 
nearly as great as that of Goatficld. In ascending it 
an immense chasm, many hundred feet deep, is to 
be seen, awfully broken and rugged, encompassed 
with mountains, whose serrated tops are covered 
with enormous heaps of granite, that show the in- 
scrutable and astonishing operations of nature in 
the formation and decomposition of the earth. 
From the summit of Camie-na-Callich there is a 
most extensive and delightful prospect. Over Kin- 
tyre is seen the western ocean, with the islands of 
Islay , Jura, Scarba, Mull , and many others, rising 
out of the wide expanse. Over Corral, the remote 
mountains of Argyle and Inverness . Over Bute, 
the Cumbrays, the mountains of Loch Long and 
Benlomond . To the south, the counties of Ren- 
frew, Ayr, and Galloway, the island of Ailsa, and 
more distant coast of Ireland . Along the north- 
west coast, for some distance, there is nothing 
particularly remarkable. It is not of great ele- 
vation, but is finely adorned with wood ; and 
composed of basalt and transition rocks, from mi- 
caceous schistus to ardesia, and basalt imbedded in 
granite. A few miles from the shore, above Dru- 
mooden Point , there are some cliffs of great extent, 
containing several large caves, stated, by tradition, to 
be those of Fingal : but the same faithless chronicle

gives to numerous caves in the Highlands, the name 
of that hero, whose dominions seem to have been too 
extensive for reality. One of them is named Kings 
Cave, from Robert the Bruce having taken shelter 
in it on his arrival from Rathlin, on the coast of 
Ireland. This cavity is 40 feet wide, and the same 
in height, and above 100 in length. Marks of 
fire are visible, and great quantities of the bones of 
sheep and goats are lying in it. It is wholly 
scooped out of solid sandstone ; and some rude at- \ 
tempt at carving figures on the walls have been 
made. The place is curious and interesting, and 
rendered dear to every Scotsman who visits it, and j 
reflects that there did the glorious patriot Bruce 
take up his residence, for nearly six months, wait- 
ing an opportunity to effect the emancipation of his 
country from the yoke of slavery. 

From Machary to Drumooden Bay , round Rhue 
Vary point, on the west, the mineralogy is very in- 
teresting. Upon this shore, betwixt the cliffs and 
the sea, there is a large sandstone beach, remarkable 
for a great vein of green pitchstone, rising from the 
sea, of great breadth, slightly bending, and travers- 
ing common argillaceous sandstone. Different sub- 
stances are embedded along with the pitchstone, and 
the vein is surrounded with various species of stone, 
curiously intermixed ; and it is intersected by se- 
veral other veins of the same kind, of different 
breadths. Not far from this is a similar vein ; and 
both are so singular an occurrence that they are 
highly deserving the attention of the geologist. 

From this, in going south, the coast is rocky, and 
a curious species of stone, having a columnar ten- 
dency, is seen above freestone. The cliffs are much 
excavated, but no distinct stratification is visible. 
Numerous fragments of rock, disintegrated from 
the neighbouring cliffs, are scattered along the 
shore. Farther south, at Tory-lin, the whole coast 
is composed of clay, porphyry, and some basalt tra- 
versing sandstone ; which is the principal forma-

tion of the shore to Beninhead, the most southerly 
part of the island ; a short way from Kilmory Kirk , 
before getting to Struey Rocks , is an immense ex- 
cavation scooped out by the sea, called the Black 
Cave ; the mouth of which is 80 feet high. It is 
40 feet wide, and 100 feet long, the sides being 
supported by rude basaltic pillars. Near the end 
there is a great opening, like a pit, to the air above, 
occasioned by the falling in of the roof ; at some 
distance, Kildonan Castle, Marquis of Bute, in 
ruins ; and opposite to it, Plada island and light- 
house ; some miles farther, is the tremendous range 
called Dripping Rocks, rising perpendicularly out 
of the sea to the height of 300 feet. These rocks 
are arenaceous basalt, in a columnar form. In one 
place the sea has washed away a great portion, and 
left a fine natural arch. On the brink of the rock, 
a stream of water rushes through a small aperture, 
and falls into the sea at a great distance from the 
base of the rock. During rain, it forms a white 
foaming arch, seen a great way off at sea, and is 
a landmark to mariners. From this a tolerable 
road, through a more level country, is carried along 
the coast to Whiting Bay. Pass towards Lamlash 
Bay, the best anchorage m Arran, and frequently 
the resort of vessels. It is sheltered by Holy Island, 
on which is a singular species of columnar sand- 
stone, forming the centre of this island, and rising 
700 feet in height. 

Upon the whole, the Island of Arran contain 
much interesting matter for the student of minera- 
logy and geology, as it displays the various compo- 
nent parts of the globe, in regular gradation, as they 
were formed, from primitivegraniticrock,tothe more 
recent species of sandstone; and for the painter, it is 
full of wild scenery, well adapted for the pencil ; while 
to the general philosopher, it will afford a source of 
contemplation, that must elevate the mind to the re- 
verence of the great Author of such stupendous 

works. From the situation of Arran, placed at the

entrance of so many arms of the sea, several inci- 
dents of Scottish history are connected with it: 
Haco, king of Norway, in 1256, assembled his 
forces in it, previous to the battle of Largs, and to 
his eventual expulsion from the dominion he had 
usurped over the western islands. After Haco’s 
overthrow, and the consequent departure of his 
people, Arran, like the other islands, became sub- 
ject to Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, in whose fa- 
mily the sovereignty of the islands continued till ; 
the reign of James V., when Macdonald relinquish- 
ed his privilege, and acknowledged himself a vas- 
sal of the crown. , 

It is chiefly the property of the Hamilton fami- 
ly, acquired in 1 480, by marriage with the heiress.

quented as bathing quarters, by a few respectable 
families from Glasgow. A short way on, at some 
distance from the shore, is Kelly House, Wallace; and 
close to it, Kelly Burn, a streamlet dividing the 
counties of Renfrew and Ayr ; 2 miles on, is 
the old castle of Skelmorly, near to which is a 
portion of a whin dyke,' 1 mile in length, part 
of it being 60 feet high, and terminating at 
the site of the castle. Close by this are the ruins 
of Knockmilly ; a mile distant is Knock Castle. 
Many vestiges of ruined castles, fortifications, and 
encampments, are visible in this neighbourhood, 
evidently distinguishing this particular part of the 
coast, as the frequent point of attack in the prime- 
val ages of the country, before Scotland became 
wholly subject to the sway of one monarch. Close 
by, in the 13th century, was fought the celebrated 
battle of the Largs, betwixt the Scots and a pow- 
erful army of the Norwegians, when the latter 

were defeated ; which put an end to their predal 

♦ 

expeditions, and rapidly exterminated them from 
every settlement which they forcibly held in the 
Scottish dominions. The issue of this battle was no 
less important to the nation than the overthrow of 
other intruders, at a subsequent period ; — for, had 
the Norwegians been successful at Largs, and the 
English at ‘ Bannockburn, it is likely that the 
very name of Scotland would have been annihilat- 
ed, and the native spirit of her people in great 
danger of being forced to stoop beneath a rod 
of oppression. Numerous monumental tumuli, 
cairns, and stone coffins, in which have been found 
ancient warlike implements, axes, and spears, are 
to be met with over the whole face of this country.

on the right is the greater island of Cumbrat / ; and 
about 3 miles farther on, Kelburn, the Earl of Glas- 
gow, on the left. Close to it are the remains of the 
castle of Fairly, of very great antiquity ; and near 
it the village of that name. On the west side of 
the large Cumbray, is the village of Millport, the an- 
nual retreat of bathers ; and opposite to ft, the 
small Cumbray. Both these islands are remarka- 
ble for remains of antiquity; for some singular 
formation and arrangement of rocks; and for vari- 
ous excavations of curious and grotesque appear- 
ance. On the smaller island is a lighthouse of re- 
cent erection, and of great use to the navigation of 
the frith. On the south side of this island, are die 
remains of a castle, the history and name of 
which have been unknown for ages; but, from 
what still remains, it must anciently have been a 
place of great importance. Its architecture exhi- 
bits proofs of a very remote period, when, like many 

other fortresses on the neighbouring coasts, it pro- 

* 

bably was erected to guard the entrance of the 
fVith. In this island, many Danish chiefs, who 
fell in the battle of the Largs, were buried, and se- 
veral of their graves may still be discovered. 
There are seven caves in this island, some of 
them so extensive as never to have been explor- ' 
ed. On a point of land, at the distance of 5 \ 
miles from Millport, stands the old castle of Peru i 
cross, or Fortincross, also a building of very great 
antiquity. The foundation is upon rocks, veiy 
close to the sea ; and it is conjectured, from 
the name, to have been the place to which 
monks, and wandering religieuse resorted, on 
their pilgrimage to Iona, when that island was 
regarded as the only abode of sanctity in the 
kingdom, from the fame of its possessor, St. Co-

grims.* It is extremely difficult to trace the history 
and epoch of the building of many old castles in 
Scotland, a circumstance that is much to be re- 
gretted, as many incidents connected with them 
would appear no less extraordinary than impor- 
tant to modem times ; and such information would 
illustrate the state of society and manners which 
obtained among our ancestors. Near this castle, 
in 1588, one of the ships of the Spanish armada 
was wrecked. . A short way on is Arneal; 4 
miles farther, Boydston ; and near it, Mountford. 
Two miles on, is the town and harbour of Ar- 
drossan, to improve which the late Earl of Eglinton 
bestowed much trouble and expense. From this 
a canal has been projected through the interior 
of the country, to join that of Paisley to Glas- 
gow ; but the latter has not been so success- 
ful a speculation as to induce the proprietors to 
continue it to Ardrossan. That nobleman’s ex- 
ertions were great to render this harbour of general 
utility ; and he had long contemplated the open- 
ing of the canal as an improvement of national 
benefit. That the work he had begun might not 
fall to oblivion, even on his death-bed he did not 
lose sight of the undertaking; for he instruct- 
ed his executors to appropriate £ 5000 yearly,

the ancient names still retained, arc in that language.

Loch Goyle Head, for which a boat starts two 
or three times in the week, and in this way a 
visit to Inveraray may be quickly performed. 
On leaving Greenock, the boat crosses the Clyde, and 
enters the mouth of Loch Long. On the right, the

and hilly. Enter Loch Goyle, which is a branch 
from Loch Long. To the right, is the point of 
Curran, the end of Argyle’s Bowling Green, so 
named in derision, from the extreme irregulari- 
ty and bleakness of the mountains. On both 
sides of Loch Goyle, the coast is exceedingly wild 
and frightful, rising boldly from the water. On 
the left side is Carrick Castle in ruins, built upon 
a rock that formed an island in the days of its 
strength, by a deep cut filled from the sea. It is a 
fine ruin, the size and security of which shows the 
consequence of the founder. It is of extreme anti- 
quity, probably of Danish origin; and seems at 
one period to have been a royal castle, having still 
the Duke of Argyle as its keeper. About 5 miles 
above, the loch terminates ; near the head is the 
Church and Manse; and in the neighbourhood, 
many curious caves of great extent, in former 
ages used by the natives as places of retreat 
in times of danger. From Loch-goyle-head to 
St. Catherines Ferry, the distance is 7 miles, 
over a very excellent and pleasant new made 
road; and the ferry across to Inveraray is 3 miles 
more. Besides the boat that plies to Loch Goyle, 
there is occasionally another going up Loch Long. 
Pass the mouth of Loch Goyle, and opposite to it, 
Porlincaple Ferry ; on the right, farther on. Fin- 
nart, Campbell ; to the left, the mill of Galashan j 
and at some distance, Ardgarton, Campbell ; close 
to which is the entrance of Glencroe ; nearly oppo- 
site, the Church and Manse ; and a little farther on, 
the inn of Arroquhar, formerly the residence of the 
chief of the Macfarlanes. Opposite, is the moun- 
tain called the Coblcr. The situation of Arroquhar 
is grand and striking. Embosomed by immense 
hills that rise around on all sides, it is among the 
most retired and rural spots in the Highlands ; and 
well calculated, in former times, for the residence 
of chieftainship, as it possessed the advantages of 
retirement, and was easily defended against the

attacks of hostile visitors. From Arroqukar it is only 
mil** to Tarbert, an excellent inn on the banks of 
Loch Lomond; and if the traveller be inclined, 
he cap return by, and see the beauties of that 
lake, as a steam boat plies regularly every morn- 
ing from Bollock, 5 miles from Dunbarton ; and 
calls at Tarbert for passengers on its return. 
This is a most agreeable and interesting trip, easily 
performed from and back to Glasgow in two days ;

'In this voyage we must refer the stranger to our 
first and seventh sections, a^s far as the Garroch 
Head, the most southerly point of the Island of 
Bute. This abrupt range of rock derives its name 
from a whistling sound produced by the wind 
blowing through its crevices, during a westerly 
gale ; Garroch being the Gaelic signification of 
mirth and laughter. Bute is a flat island, without 
much of the picturesque ; but on approaching the 
Garroch Head, the prospect is very striking, for

course is nearly south-west, steering for Holy Isl- 
and, on the east coast of Arran, To the north, is 
seen the entrance of Loch Fyne ; and nearly in the 
same direction, to the right, the Cock of Arran, 
about 12 miles off. Pass Brodick Bay, distant 10 
miles ; and the house of Carmichael, Fullerton. To 
the east, the coast of Ayrshire, with Pencross Cas- 
tle, situated on a point of land, and, for many cen- 
turies, exposed to the turbulence of the Atlantic 
storms. Further on, Ardrossan Harbour, and the 
Heads of Ayr, bearing south-east. Pass close to 
Holy Island, within which is Lamlash Bay, a fine 
anchorage for vessels. Upon the south point 
of the island of Arran, is an old castle, named 
Kildonan, belonging to the Marquis of Bute. 
At some distance from this castle, is the island 
of Plada, on which there is a lighthouse. From 
this the course is almost due south, the mouth 
of Belfast Loch being about 50 miles distant. 
Soon pass, on the left, about 7 miles, the rock 
of Ailsa, or Perch of Clyde, in maritime language, 
and, on the same side, at a considerable dis- 
tance, is seen the Corsal Point, at the mouth of 
Loch Ryan, on which is placed a tower, with a re- 
volving light. Another lighthouse is discovered, 
situated on the Copeland Island, which appears close 
in upon the county of Down coast. Approaching 
Black Head, on the west side of Belfast Loch, Isl- 
and Magee, and the Gabbin Rocks, are seen to the 
right, stretching out from the mouth of Lame 
Loch, distance 6 miles. In the same direction, the 
Maiden Rocks, partly sunk, and running under 
water for several miles, to the great danger of 
navigators. Here the prospect becomes more exten- 
sive than from any other situation we have passed. 
To the right, are seen Fair Head, and the high 
land of Antrim; the distant islands of Islay, 
and the conical paps of Jura ; and, occupy- 
ing a part of the intermediate space, the an- 
gry moil of Kintyre. To the left, the moil of

Down, stretching as far as Donaghadee, and a great 
portion of the Green Isle of Erin smiling under 
all its privations, as if looking forward to circum- 
stances of more flattering prosperity. 

Belfast Loch is 20 miles in length, separating the 
counties of Antrim and Down, the former on the 
right, the latter on the left ; both improving un- 
der agricultural management, and adorned with 
many neat villas. Pass Black Head, to the right, 
and enter Belfast Loch, generally keeping close in 
upon that shore. One mile up, Chichester Castle,

which, is Bella Hill, Dalway. The road to Lame 
is seen winding up the face of the hill. On this 
beach the French, under Thurot, landed in 17 60, 
with the intention of taking possession of Carrick-

villas and bleach-greens are so numerous, that 
it -would be tedious to give a detailed account ; 
but they show the opulence and improving 
state of this part of the country, in a very satisfac- 
tory point of view. Four miles from Belfast, the 
navigable channel takes a wonderfully circuitous 
course, and at low water, the quantity of land left 
dry, by the efflux of the tide, is very consi- 
derable. Mr. Thomson, of Jeanny Mount, has se- 
cured to his estate about 50 acres of excellent land, 
though at considerable expense. Belfast is sit- 
uated at the extremity of this arm of die sea, 
named, as in Scodand, a loch. Near it, is a very old 
bridge of 2 1 arches, across the river Laggan. It is a 
handsome town, with many elegant buildings ; and, 
from its trade, now become a place of opulence, 
and very respectable as a sea-port. It is in the 
county of Antrim, remarkable no less for its pic- 
turesque mountains, various romantic scenery, and 
its majestic Loch Neagh, than for the urbani- 
ty and hospitality of its natives. 

Having conducted the stranger the length we pur- 
posed, by steam navigation, it was not our intention to 
go into the history of a country, the local incidents of 
which, when conjoined with its great antiquity, are 
important subjects, that cannot fail to interest every 
person who visits it ; but it may only be a slight 
deviation from our work, to point out such places as 
are worthy of notice in die neighbourhood of Bel- 
fast ; where visitors, who cannot afford time to go 
far into the country, may spend a few days very 
agreeably. 

The steam boats from Clyde go to Belfast three 
times a- week, regularly ; which gives a stranger an 
opportunity of employing whatever time suits his 
conveniency, in the vicinity of that town. To as- 
sist him, a short sketch of the scenery round Bel- 
fast is given ; and should the Giant’s Gauservay be 
visited, we have also introduced an outline of 
the journey to that wonderful phenomenon.

EXTENSIVE PROSPECT. 


The tour by Loch Neagh is considered the most 
agreeable, and, as such, is usually recommended to 
strangers. Leave Belfast, and proceed by Shank 
HiU. One mile forward, pass Parish cemetery ; 
and begin to ascend the hill, the view increasing in 
extent and beauty as the road proceeds. Behind, is 
the town, surrounded with many villas and bleach- 
greens ) and, to the south, the prospect stretches to 
the towns of Lisburn and Hillsborough, the former 
7, and the latter 10 miles distant.* The view, in 
that direction, is interrupted by the Morne moun- 
tains, [rearing their blue summits to the sky, and 
softened, by their distance, into a delicate back- 
ground. Continuing the ascent, the long stretch 
of Belfast Loch is gradually expanded below, 
which, with its cultivated and populous shores, ex- 
hibits a very facinating picture. Having attained the 
summit of the hill, a wide and varied portion of the 
country is spread below the eye. In front, is the 
immense sheet of Loch Neagh ; and, to the east- 
ward, Belfast • and Strangford lochs, are seen at 
the same time. To the north, are the Slanush 
mountains ; and, to the west, those of Derry ap- 
pear in a long range towards the county of Done- 
gal. In this part of Ireland, the mountains do not 
possess the bold and picturesque character of Scot- 
tish scenery. 

Proceed to Crumlin Village, and to Glendarroci, 
Heyland, which is a romantic villa, in the cottage 
style, adorned with much taste. On the river is a con- 
siderable cataract, at times forming a fine object in 
this secluded retirement. Should the stranger wish 
to visit Loch Neagh, the distance is about 3 miles 
from’ Crumlin; and on the banks of the lake, he can 
readily procure a boat to visit Ram's Island, where 
are the remains of an ancient round tower, but of 
which no tradition exists to declare the history. Ih 
many parts of Ireland, there are still to be seen some

considerable ruins of those old buildings, the original 
purposes of which are unknown, and which, like 
many other ' vestiges connected with the remote 
periods of Irish history, will probably continue 
to be enveloped in impenetrable obscurity. Loch 
Neagh is one of the most extensive lakes in Eu- 
rope, covering an area of 58,200 acres ; but from 
the smoothness of its banks, which, in a great 
measure, are destitute of wood, it does not possess 
that romantic beauty and picturesque effect which 
some other Irish lakes exhibit in a striking de- 
gree. In going from Crumlin to Antrim, the 
road passes through a fertile country, a short dis- 
tance from the border of Lock Neagh. It is ren- 
dered agreeable by several gentlemen’s seats, the 
most interesting of which is Green Mount, Thomp- 
son, a romantic villa, adorned with considerable 
taste, and superior to any in the north of Ireland. 
Close to the town of Antrim is another round tower, 
said to be the most entire in the kingdom. Antrim 
is an inconsiderable place, built on the banks of a 
river named the Six Miles Water. In the town, 
is JMassareene Castle, lately repaired and enlarged, 
and now a fine mansion. Leaving Antrim, pass 
some bleach-greens ; 3 miles more, Dunadij paper 
mill ; and a little farther on, the village of Temple 
Patrick, and Castle Upton, Lord Templetown. 
Proceed through a pleasant country towards Bel- 
fast Loch, which soon comes in view. On the 
right. Cave Hill begins to rise, and gradually as- 
sumes a formidable appearance. It is partly com- 
posed of lime and alabaster, considerable quarries 
of which have been advantageously opened for 
some years. On the left, the village of White Ab- 
bey ; from which some of the Scottish mountains 
and the Copeland Lighthouse are to be seen. Af- 
ter descending the hill, the road joins that from 
Carrickfergus, upon the shore of Belfast Loch, 
from whence there is now a fine prospect of the 
romantic Cave Hill, resorted to in summer by par-

ties of pleasure ; and, at Easter, by numerous 
merry groups of every denomination. The road 
continues along the shore, and at the distance of 2 
miles more, enters Belfast. 

If the traveller means to visit the Giant's Cause - 
nay from Belfast, he will take the road to Carrick- 
fergus, distant about 10 miles. On his way thither 
he will have a fine prospect of the Down coast, on 
the opposite side of Belfast Loch. Before entering 
the town of Carrickfergvs, on the left, are the re- 
mains of an old castle, called the Three Sisters. 
This town is not now of the same importance as 
formerly ; but it must still claim respect from the 
antiquary of taste, from its containing many reliques 
of the olden time, particularly its large old castle, 
and elegant Gothic cathedral. At some distance, is 
island Magee, an isthmus, though improperly termed 
an island, where, in 1641, the combined English 
and Scottish forces barbarously put to death, in one 
night, its whole peaceable population of 300 men, ' 
women, and children, and that without cause, or 
personal quarrel ; but as a wanton retaliation for 
the previous massacre of their countrymen, in a 
distant part of Ireland, during an insurrection in- 
stigated by the Catholic priesthood, and of which 
the most dreadful accounts are given. About 10 
miles from Carrickfergus, is the town of Lame, a 
small sea-port, the road from which to Glenarm 
passes through a delightful country, enriched, in 
all directions, by elegant mansions. On the road 
side, across the Slamish Mountains, there is a sin- 
gular spring well called Tibbermore-gre&amp;t well, the 
stream from which is so considerable, that it turns 
three mills. The next town is Glenarm, a sea-port, 
agreeably situated on a small bay of the same 
name, where once stood a celebrated monastery, 
the majestic ruins of which are still to be seen. 
Close by are the castle and beautiful domains of the 
Earl of Antrim. Pass through the village of Cairn- 

clough, along the road from which, several handsome

houses continue to adorn the country, to the town of 
Cushetidun ; near to which, Mount Edward, and 
the ruins of Redcastle. Continuing the route, are 
many seats, tastefully ornamented, till, near the 
promontory of Fair Head, the face of nature is 
changed, and appears under great distortion. This 
point rises abruptly to 631 feet above the level of 
the sea. It is composed of columnar basalt, huge 
masses of which, during a course of ages, have 
fallen to the bottom, and lie in tremendous heaps, 
like the wreck of a former world. The perpen- 
dicular altitude of the columns is 283 feet. One 
of them is a gigantic quadrangular prism, 33 feet 
by 36 on the sides, and about 200 feet in height. 
It is the largest basaltic pillar in the world, ex- 
ceeding the pedestal that supports the statue of 
Peter the Great, at Petersburgh ; and much great- 
er than the shaft of Pompey's pillar at Alexandria. 
Among the columnar wonders of this promontory, 
there is a passage called the Grey Man’s Path, of very 
extraordinary formation. It is a deep chasm, which 
divides this headland in two. The upper part is nar- 
row^ and covered over with a huge pillar that has 
fallen across it, and is suspended in a frightful 
manner. In descending this fissure, the space gra- 
dually widens, and displays a beautiful arrange- 
ment of pillars in various degrees of elevation, un- 
til, at the bottom, they attain a grand perpendicu- 
lar altitude of 220 feet. This path conducts the 
traveller to the base of the promontory, round 
which are scattered the massive fragments of frac- 
tured pillars, placed, as it were, to oppose the 
fury of the impetuous ocean, which here perpe- 
tually rages with uncommon violence. This head- 
land is the Jtobogdium Promontorium of Ptolemy, 
and forms the north-east cape of Ireland. The 
wild aspect of this point is peculiarly striking. 
Desolation and barrenness are its appropriate cha- 
racters : for nature seems here almost to have ex- 
hausted her powers of devastation, and to have

rendered this scene the most awful and sublime 
that imagination can conceive. Proceeding along, 
at a short distance, is the town of Ballycastle ; 
- near to which a curious discovery was some 
years ago made by accident, of a coal-mine hav- 
ing been wrought to an immense extent, and 
in a regular manner; but at a period so very 
remote, that no knowledge, nor even tradition of 
it exists. At the distance of six miles, is the island 
of Rathlin, which every Scotsman must vener- 
ate, as having afforded refuge to their heroic so- 
vereign, Robert the Bruce. From the bold aspect 
of the shore of Rathlin, and neighbouring coast, 
from Fair Head to Bengore Head, they have pro- 
bably at one time been united ; but separated by 
some great catastrophe of nature, which, along a 
considerable portion of this shore, seems to have 
deranged its original formation. Bengore Head is 
made up of several capes or promontories, one of 
which is named Pleaskin, of very beautiful compo- 
sition, being a colonnade of perpendicular basal- 
tic pillars 60 feet high, placed upon an immense 
bed of compact irregular rock, which is supported 
below by another range of pillars near 50 feet in 
length, and these lower pillars rest upon a layer of 
red ochre-stone ; the whole constituting a very in- 
teresting geological curiosity. The summit of 
Pleaskin is the highest elevation of this coast, be- 
ing upwards of 400 feet above the level of the sea; 
and the view from it is the most imposing that can 
be imagined ; for a series of headlands, in fine per- 
spective, are to be seen, which present a captivat- 
ing picture of wild coast scenery. 

Close to this, is the village of Ballintoy, from the 
shore of which, a bridge of rope is thrown to 
a rock of considerable height, 60 feet distant in the 
sea, for the purpose of fishing. 

The coast of Antrim, for a considerable way, is 
principally composed of basaltic rock, forming se- 
veral small romantic bays. From Bengore Head

it is only a short way to the Giant’s Causeway ; 
near to which there is a resting place at Bush Mills. 
Upon going from that stage to the Causeway, the 
traveller is commonly annoyed by a host of tatter- 
ed natives, who offer their services as guides, and 
from whose importunity it is quite impossible to 
get free. For his comfort, therefore, and to stop 
the incessant noisy entreaties of the whole, he will 
do well to select some one of them as a conductor, 
who will lead him down a steep path, made, at 
considerable expense, by the late Earl of Bristol, 
Bishop of Londonderry. 

This immense body of columnar basalt resembles 
a vast quay, or mole, projecting from the land at the 
height of 200 feet, but gradually diminishing, un- 
til, at the length of 725 feet, it dips into the sea, 
where it is lost. The columns which form this 
magnificent fabric are of direct perpendicular ar- 
rangement, closely compacted* die pillars being so 
accurately joined to each other, that the point of a 
knife cannot be inserted between them. These 
pillars are pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal, 
more rarely prismatic, commonly of the two former 
shapes, but never perfectly equilateral, or of the 
same dimensions. Their transverse section resembles 
that of a honey-comb, though not in the same just 
proportion ; but the whole forms a beautiful poly- 
gonial pavement. The Causeway is divided into 
three portions, termed the great, middle, and little, 
in consequence of its being intersected by two par- 
allel trap or whin dykes. These dykes traverse the 
columns from north to south, and have probably 
been the means of preserving this admirable piece 
of nature’s work from destruction ; for, although 
the trap is worn down on the surface, it has a 
steadfast base, which supports the columns. At 
the upper parts of the mole, the pillars are from 
27 to S3 feet in length, justly proportioned, and 
straight. When the prismatic form occurs, the an- 
gles are very sharp ; and the whole pillars present

a remarkable articulation, in the manner of ball and 
socket, throughout their length. The usual diame- 
ter of the pillars is from 1 6 to 24 inches, seldom 
varying from that breadth. The cliff which hangs 
over the Causeway is from 350 to 400 feet above 
the sea level. From the basaltic construction of 
the shore, it is deeply indented with small bays, all 
of which have received some fanciful name from 
the natives, or casual visitors. The eastern pros- 
pect of the Causeway , at a short distance, presents, 
in the centre, a bold front of beautiful pillars, 33 
feet high, forming a colonnade of 120 feet in length, 
the joints of the component parts being distinctly 
seen. The height of the pillars, from the east end 
of this majestic structure, gradually diminishes; 
and, narrowing to a point for 540 feet more, 
they slope gently into the sea. 

On the west side, the appearance of the Giant’s 
Causeway is particularly grand and striking. In some 
places rising in immense walls, as if built by art, but 
broken ; and, in other places, somewhat irregular, 
like the ruins of some magnificent palace, or deso- 
late city. On this side, the astonishing extent of 
the basaltic formation is seen, composing the entire 
stretch of the shore, as far as the eye can follow it, 
even to the upper verge of the highest land. The 
texture of the basalt of this Causeway is very com- j 
pact and fine, of a dark iron-grey colour. The 
fracture is rhomboidal, with sharp edged frag- 
ments, and in blocks it is sonorous. The basaltic 
pillars of the Island of Staffa are of similar for- 
mation with those of the Giant’s Causeway ; and, 
though at the distance of 150 miles due north, may 
be a continuation of the same wonderful structure, 
both being very surprising examples of the inscruta- 
ble operations of nature, of which there is no other 
instance in the world. The town of Coleraine is 
about 9 miles west of the Giant’s Causeway, 
from whence there is a regular mail-coach com- 
munication to Belfast ; so that if the traveller does

not incline to retrace his steps by the coast, this 
conveyance will conduct him through the interior 
of the country back to Belfast. 

Towards Coleraine the coast is very interesting 
to the antiquary, as well as the geologist, from the 
number of old castles that adorn its wild promon- 
tories, and the grotesque appearances of the rocks 
and caves which they contain. In particular, the 
stranger should visit the magnificent ruins of Bun- 
luce Cattle, about 3 miles from the Giant’s Cause- 
way, and close to the road going to Coleraine. 
It is placed on a high abrupt rock, jutting a consi- 
derable way into the sea, and forms one of the most 
picturesque and commanding objects on the north 
coast of Ireland. No situation could have been 
chosen where nature and art were so perfectly com- 
bined to render a fortress impregnable. The first 
great area contains the remains of numerous houses, 
and was surrounded with massive walls, parts of 
which are still standing. This court seems to have 
been the station of the soldiery, or men-at-arms 
for defending the castle, which is itself built on the 
brink of a precipice rising about 1 50 feet from the 
sea, and insulated from the other ruins by a giddy 
chasm of 20 feet in breadth, and above 100 feet 
deep. The communication was probably by a 
drawbridge, and is now by a temporary narrow 
pathway thrown across by the natives, who vener- 
ate this ancient fabric, from its being connected with 
some of the most extraordinary and interesting inci- 
dents of Irish history. It is the property of the 
' Antrim family, whose ancestors, during the pe- 
riod of a bold independence, occupied it as their 
place of residence. It commands an intermina- 
ble sea view; but the situation is consequently 
exposed to the Atlantic storms, which here rage 
with dreadful fury, the shore, for a great dis-

ing, into which the sea flows, and which is fit 
to contain a great number of boats in perfect 
security; the water being of considerable depth. 

It would deviate from our plan, were we to at- 
tempt describing a land tour of greater extent in 
Ireland. The stranger who is anxious to explore 
the interior of that interesting country, will find 
numerous local itineraries of the roads, that will 
direct him to the various objects of curiosity, and 
to such publications we must beg leave to refer 
him.* 

* Since this section was composed, we are happy to learn, 
that for the accommodation of the public, the Britannia Steam 
Packet is occasionally, during the season, to visit the Giant's 
Causeway . By this conveyance, those who are desirous of see- 
ing that astonishing natural curiosity, will save the fatigue of 
the journey from Belfast . The vessel leaves dasgoiv on the 
morning of Friday, taking the course we have noticed in our 
6th section, to Campbelton* On the following day, she visits 
the Giant's Causeway , returning the same night to Campbel - 
ton : and, as usual, on Monday morning, returns to Glasgow*

FROM GLASGOW TO LIVERPOOL 




Though the voyage from Glasgoiv to Liverpool 
hardly comes within the range which was at first 
projected for this work ; yet, as the intercourse is 
now s&lt;5 great, we are induced to describe the usual 
course of the steam vessels in going to that empo- 
rium of commerce. 

In our preceding sections, a part of the track, as 
far as Pencross Castle , on the north-west coast of 
Ayrshire, is given. From that point the course is 
south and by west, steering for the headland of 
Galloway . On the right, is the island of Arran, 
and the moil of Kin tyre ; and, on the left, the coast 
of Ayr, which receding, forms a great semicircular 
bay for nearly the whole extent of the county. 
Along the shore are seen, in succession, the harbour 
of Ardrossan ; the towns of Saltcoats and Irvine ; 
the Troon point and harbour; and near it, the Lady 
Isle, on which is placed a lighthouse. More 
deeply embayed, at the distance of 10 miles, the 
town of Ayr ; and close to it, the range of rocks 
named the Heads of Ayr . A short way forward 
is Dunmore Point ; and, behind it, the high land of 
Brown Carrick Hills . Not far distant, is Colzean 
Castle, the romantic seat of the Earl of Cassilis, 
seated on a rock nearly perpendicular, the base of

which is washed by the sea. Near it, is Turnber - 
ry Point, on which are the venerable ruins of the 
ancient castle of that name, celebrated as the pro- 
perty of the brave Robert the Bruce, acquired by 
his marrying the heiress, in 1274, which gave him 
the title of Earl of Carrick, before he ascended the 

f 

Scottish throne. After the expedition of Edward 
I., that fortress was in possession of the English, 
while Bruce was forced to a temporary abandon- 
ment of his exertions to relieve his country. It was 
at Turnber ry he landed from Arran, in 1306, when 
he mistook an accidental fire for the signal of his 
spy, previously sent to procure information regard- 
ing the state of that district. From the dawning 
of the appointed day, Bruce steadfastly kept his 
eye on the coast of Carrick, in expectation of the 
signal, and the moment he descried it, he flew to 
his boat ; but it was night ere he and his associates 
in arms could reach the shore. There, his faithful 
spy waited his arrival, aware of the casual decep- 
tion, and gave him the mortifying intelligence that 
there was no hope of assistance. “ Traitor,” said 
Bruce, “ why did you light the fire ?” “ I made 

no signal,” replied the spy, “ but observing a fire, 
which I dreaded might deceive you, I hastened 
here to warn you of your danger.” Sometime 
thereafter, Bruce wrested Turnberry Castle from 
the English, and nearly razed it to the ground. It 
was not again repaired, which is to be regretted, 
as the situation is truly delightful, commanding 
one of the most extensive prospects of any situa- 
tion on the estuary of the Clyde. About 12 miles 
farther on, is the town of Girvan ; and due west 
from it, at the distance of 9 miles, is the rock of 
Ailsa, close to which the steam vessels generally 
pass.* On the coast of Ayr, and opposite to the 
rock of Ailsa, there is a remarkable conical hill, 
called Knocfcdolian ; rising about 2000 feet above 


See note, page 50. deacription of Ailsa.

the level of the sea, and which mariners, it is said, 
have sometimes, in foggy weather, taken for the Craig 
of Ailsa ; but it is, at all times, of singular service 
to vessels, as a conspicuous land-mark, when they 
enter the Frith of Clyde. Next is Bennin Point ; and 
near it, the village of Ballmtrae, about 1 0 miles from 
which is the entrance of Loch Ryan, running a consi- 
derable way into the district of Galloway. On the 
southwest side of the loch is the point of Corshill, 

on which is erected a beacon, with a revolving light. 

% 

Looking back from this point, a grand view of Ailsa, 
and the picturesque mountains of Arran, is obtain- 
ed, which, with the long peninsula of Kin/yre, 
and the now visible shores of Ireland, form a very 
interesting series of objects. Having passed Loch 
Ryan, and Corshill Lighthouse, the course takes a 
south-easterly direction, winding round the Rhinns 
of Galloway. About 1 mile forward, is Drochead, 
and Port Camillan ; and, one mile more, Craig 
Laggan, and Port Long. Three miles farther, is 
Drumawhirn Hill, on the summit of which is to be 
traced the site of an ancient tower, probably 
founded for an alarm beacon, and used as such in 
those days, when Ireland enjoyed a separate mon- 
archy from England, or Scotland, and when she 
sent forth her warriors to seek their fortunes in the 
conquest of Scottish territory. For such a pur- 
pose, the situation of Drumawhirn was admirably 
chosen, as it comprehends an extensive view of the 
channel, and opposite coast of Ireland ; so that hos- 
tile armies could be discerned long before they 
reached the Scottish shores. On a more level 
situation, about one mile farther, is the ruin of Gal- 
denach Castle ; and 1 mile on. Salt Pans Bay , and 
manufactory. In passing along the shore, a view 
of Caimpat Hill , near Port Patrick 9 is obtained. 
This eminence, which is 800 feet high, was also, at 
one period, a military station, of which it still bears 
the appearance ; and, from its local position, em- 
braces a wide stretch of horizon, extending to the

western Highlands, coast of England, Isle of Mann, 
and Ireland. Pass Kemp's Walls , Kilintringan 
Bay , and Black Heady and enter the harbour of 
Pari Patricky where the steam vessels regularly 
call in passing to and from Liverpool . 

At a short distance from Port Patricky on the 
right, seated on the brink of a tremendous precipice 
rising abruptly from the sea, is the ruin of Dunsky 
Castley which, during the times of its baronial impor- 
tance, was a fortress of considerable magnificence ; 
but has recently been mutilated for the purpose 
of building a modern seat of the most homely 
architecture. The harbour of Port Patrick is form- 
ed by nature, being steep and rocky on both sides, 
and so narrow that the navigation is hazardous. 
From Port Patrick the coast is wild and rocky, in- 
creasing in ruggedness to the Moil of Galloway, a 
bold headland, 25 miles distant. The Isle of Mann 
lies south-east from this, the nearest part of which 
is 30 miles distant. A view of the whole island 
is distinctly seen from the Moil of GaUorvay , ex- 
tending from the Calf of Mann y a small island situ- 
ated at the south-west extremity, to the point of 
Ayrey on the north, occupying a space of 40 
miles in length. Passing the Moil Head of Gal- 
loway y on the left is the great bay of Glenluce ; 
about half way across which is seen the Scaur 
rocks, and the more distant land of Wigtm y and the 
point of Barrow Head . In approaching the Isle 
of Manny the land of Cumberland gradually becomes 
more visible. The point of Ayrey on which a very 
fine lighthouse has recently been built, forms the 
northern extremity of the Isle of Mann , and is a low 
sandy beach of considerable extent. A tremen- 
dous tide runs past this point. To a stranger, it 
would seem, from its agitated surface, as if a dan- 
gerous reef of rocks lay beneath. A bank, called 
King William’s Sandy lies a considerable way off 
the shore ; but it is believed that, even at low wa- 
ter, coasting vessels can go over it. After douh-

ling Ayre pointy the coast, to the town of Ramsay, 
appears one immense 6and bank, and forms the 
beautiful bay -of the same name. From Ramsay to 
Douglas the coast is bold and precipitous. The 
town of Douglas, when viewed from the sea, has a 
pleasant appearance. It has a fine pier, at one ex- 
tremity of which a lighthouse is placed. The har- 
bour runs up, with a very considerable depth of 
water, the whole length of the town. There are 
some fine buildings in the town, but the streets in 
the old part of it are narrow and intricate. It con- . 
tains about 7000 inhabitants, has four churches, 
established, dissenting, and Roman Catholic, and 
possesses two or three very good inns. The coun- 
try people still retain their original dialect, — the 
Manks ; and, on market days, little else is heard 
spoken, although they speak the English language 
very correctly, but with somewhat of an Irish ac- 
cent. The peasantry, in their appearance, bear 
a very close resemblance to those of Scotland. 
Douglas is a cheerful place, and is much resort- 
ed to by strangers of limited incomes, as it is 
much cheaper to live in the Isle of Mann than in 
any part of Great Britain, being comparatively 
free from taxation. - 

From Douglas Bay to the mouth of the river 
Mersey, the course is south-east, distant about 95 
miles. The Scottish shores of Gallotvay and Niths- 
dale gradually become dim, apd are lost, while the 
land of Cumberland is scarcely discernible, and that 
of Lancashire has not yet come into view. 

To a stranger nothing can be more appalling than 
the running in upon the banks of Liverpool, with a 
N.W. wind ; but the danger, if not more apparent 
than real, is, at all events, sufficiently guarded 
against ; for, from the admirable regulations under 
which the system of pilotage in the Mersey is esta- 
blished, there is scarcely any risk, before a vessel 
approaches the dangerous part of the navigation, of 
getting a pilot on board, whose knowledge of the 

G

LIVERPOOL. 


course, and practical dexterity, are sufficient to dis- 
pel every fear. To warn mariners, a ship, on 
which three lights are exhibited, is moored beyond 
the banks. After passing this vessel, the buoys, 
which are placed to show the navigable channel, 
appear ; and, one after another, the land marks, 
lighthouses, and windmills are seen. The pilot- 
boats are eleven in all, and numbered accordingly ; 
each of them carries from six to twenty-four pilots. 
The boats are sloop-rigged, and are from 30 to 50 
tons burthen, and admirably adapted for their par- 
ticular use. The pilots are regularly indentured 
to their occupation for seven years, and are gene- 
rally taken from the country, so that they may be 
said to have known no other than the hardy life to 
which they have been bred. No sailor, however 
expert, is permitted to ply as a pilot. The pilots 
are, in general, young, active, civil men. The 
co&amp;st of Lancashire ' and Cheshire , on nearing the 
mouth of the Mersey, looks sandy and rather bleak. 
On the Cheshire side are to be seen the long row 
of signals placed for the several purposes of ap- 
prising the Liverpool merchants when their ships 
appear in the offing, to give notice when vessels 
seem in danger, and to call out pilots. 

The multiplicity of vessels of every description, 
seen going up and down the river, is almost incon- 
ceivable, and most forcibly indicates the extensive 
trade of Liverpool ; and which is still more conspicuous 
on getting to the landing place, all around which is 
a scene of bustle and confusion, ngt to be described. 
Liverpool, like all other places of successful commerce, 
has greatly increased in size and population, with- 
in the last twenty years ; and, if its trade continues 
equally prosperous, it bids fair soon to rival any 
sea-port in the world. The growing extent of the 
town will not surprise a stranger so much as the 
magnitude of the different docks, (particularly the 
Regent dock, which, when finished, will be one 
of the finest in Europe), and the regularity with 


&lt;

which every thing is conducted, though there ap- 
pears so much hurry and disorder. 

Liverpool being the great emporium of commerce, 
as Glasgow is that of manufactures, and both situ- 
ated on the western sea, their interests, in a great 
degree, become reciprocal. This necessarily pro- 
duces a constant communication, which is now ef- 
fected with the utmost rapidity, and comfort, by 
means of two very fine steam vessels, fitted up with 
every accommodation for passengers, and upon 
principles of the most approved construction. These 
vessels are now so regulated, that one of them sails ' 
every three days from Glasgow and Liverpool; 
thus rendering a visit from the former to London, 
more expeditious, less fatiguing, and less expensive 
than any coach, or land journey ; the distance from 
Liverpool to London, by land, being little more than 
a third of that from Glasgow by land to London. 
The steam boats just alluded to, are severally nam- 
ed, the Superb and the Robert Bruce, and are fitted 
up exclusively for the accommodation of passen- 
gers. They are the property of a joint stock com- 
pany, composed chiefly of Glasgow merchants, and 
are said to have cost little short of £ 16 , 000 . The 
Superb is, at this moment, the finest, largest, and 
most powerful steam vessel in Britain. She regis- 
ters 241 tons, and is impelled by two very fine en- 
gines, of 36 horse power each : to which copper 
boilers are attached. There are, in this vessel, 
three cabins, two of which are handsomely fitted 
up, with every requisite for the accommodation of 
the first class of passengers ; and provided with a 
full complement of excellent sleeping places. One 
of these cabins is exclusively appropriated for 
the use of females. The Robert Bruce is like- 
wise a very fine vessel, ' though of inferior size, 
and is proportionably furnished with two en- 
gines of 30 horse power. The accommodation 
is also excellent ; and, in either, a degree of ele- 
gance and comfort is to be met with, rarely expe-

rienced in sea voyages, and no where excelled. 
The average duration of the passage from the Clyde 
to Liverpool , does not exceed thirty hours. The 
fare of the principal cabins, including provisions, ’ 
is £2 1 5s. ; that of the steerage, without provi- 
sions, £l Is.; the intermediate distances in pro- 
portion. The days of sailing, from either port, are 
Tuesday and Friday.

The city of Glasgow has, of late, increased so

considered the first provincial town in the British 
dominions ; while its manufactures, have arisen to 
such perfection, and its trade has been pursued 
with such vigour, as to have excited the surprise 
and admiration of the world. 

A stranger will have considerable gratification by 
staying some days at Glasgow; and that he may 
have an opportunity of examining every thing 
worthy of observation in the city and neighbour-

his journey, and extend it towards the Western 
Highlands , we shall direct his route by the most ap- 
proved and interesting roads to that country. 

fn Plate I. an accurate draught of the road from 
Glasgow to Dunbarton , is laid down. 

Leaving Glasgow by its western extremity, and pass- 
ing through the suburb of Anderston, numerous villas 
and gardens are seen on both sides, variously placed, 
and decorated according to the taste and opulence of 
the owners. On the left, immediately on leaving 
Anderstoji, the Cranston Hill Water Reservoir ; and 
soon after, on the right, the Royal Botanic Garden. 

A short way on, Sandy ford toll-bar. At some dis- 
tance, on the right, Kelvin Grove , Dennistoun ; and 
near it, Kelvin Bank, Wilson. Close by, on the left. 
Overnewton, Craig; and, on the same side, York Hill, 
Gilbert. Near this, the road goes off to the right, 
and, at 2 1 miles from the city, crosses the river Kel- 
vin by a modem bridge, prettily situated under the ' 
house of Gilmour Hill, Bogle. Village of Partick, 
and flour mills ; Old Bridge, and Bishops Castle, in 
ruins, on the left. On the right, Doun Hill, Buchan- 
an ; and the villas of Campbell, Russell, and Muir ; 
and further, on the same side, Hillhead, Hamil- 
ton. Here the river Clyde is seen, with a con- 
stant succession of vessels plying on its surface. 
On the right, half a mile forward, Broomhill, Per- 
ston. A little further, on the opposite side of the 
Clyde, Lint house, Watson ; and a short way, on 
the same side, Shieldkall, Oswald. To the right, 
a little forward, Jordan Hill, Smith ; and on the &lt; 
left, Scotstoun, Oswald. On the other side of 
Clyde, opposite, Elderslie, Spiers ; and, 1 mile more 
pass through Yocker toll and village. A short way 
forward, on the south side of the river, the new 
house of Renfield, Campbell ; on the right, at some 
distance from the road, a whimsical gate, Garscad - 
den, Mrs. Colquhoun ; and higher up. Cockney, 
Hamilton. On the left, is seen. News hot Isle, in 
the river ; and about miles further, the road

crosses the Forth and Clyde Canal ; the length from 
sea to sea being 35 miles, with 39 locks. On the 
left. Lord Dundas’ Alkaline Work. To the right, 
Dalmuir, Collins ; and, on the left, his extensive 
Paper Manufactory. On the opposite bank of the 
river. Park, Fulton ; and, on the right. Mount- 
blow, Bowie. On the other side of Clyde, North r 
bar, Stewart ; half a mile further, ascend Dahiot - 
ter Hill ; having obtained the summit of which, 
the -sublime and captivating view, formerly no- 
ticed, is beheld ; but in a more perfect degree, 
as this elevated situation commands a more ex- 
tensive range of vision, than that from the sur- 
face of the water. It is scarcely possible to de- 
pict the grandeur of the delightful prospect that 
is here presented, by the variety of objects so 
happily combined within reach of the eye, upon 
which the most callous insensibility cannot look 
with indifference, if what is beautiful and mag- 
nificent in nature can claim admiration. The road 
suddenly descends upon the village of Kilpatrick, 
a place of great antiquity, being so named, as 
conjectured by fanciful historians, from being the 
nativity of the patriarch of Ireland, of whose mi- 
gration from his parental soil, many ridiculous 
stories are told. Tradition is a vague and faithless 
chronicle, never to be trusted. If the truth were 
known, it would probably turn out that the per- 
son who gave its name to Kilpatrick, was of inferior 
rank to St. Patrick, and had his abode there. The' 
expression, Kil, or more properly Keil, in the Celtic 
language, signifies, the Cell, or house of a holy man ; 
a name adopted during the times of paganism, and 
the early introduction of the Roman Catholic faith 
into Scotland. The old church of Kilpatrick, lately 
taken down, was a venerable relict of ancient times ; 
and if the traveller has any relish for sepulchral con- 
templation, he will find in the cemetery, some tomb 
stones of Druidic, or, at all events, of very early 

sculpture, not unworthy of his notice. About 2

DUNGLAS AND DUNBARTON CASTLES. 




miles from this, to the north-east, as formerly stat- 
ed, there is a Roman Bridge, still very entire, which 
is the only one now remaining in Scotland. It must 
have been built before the year 426, so that it has 
stood for 1394 years. On the south side of the 
Clyde, nearly opposite to Kilpatrick, is Erskint 
House, Lord Blantyre. A short way forward, on 
the right, Glenerbnck, Roberton ; and below,, on 
the left. Bowling Inn and Bay, where the great 
canal joins the Frith of Clyde. Going on a little, to 
the left,- is Frisky Hall, Smith'; and near it, on the 
right, Auchentorlie, Buchanan. On the left, jutting 
into the river, is a small point of rock, on which 
stand the melancholy remains of Dunglas Castle, 
an ancient Roman fortress, which marked the west- 
ern boundary of their territory ; but this castle had 
undergone many additions, after the departure of 
that people from Britain. About a mile further, on 
the right. Little Mill, and Milton Printfield, Mitchell. 
Here several places, on the south side of the Clyde 
are seen, viz. Church and Manse of Erskine, Bishop- 
ton House, and Drums. Having passed Milton, 
Dumbuck Hill is on the right, being the abrupt ter- 
mination of the long range of Campsie Hills, on the 
west. Near the base of Dumbuck, the road divides, 
that branch on the right going to Stirling, or the 
Trosachs, by Drymen ; and that on the left to Dun- 
barton. The singular appearance of the rock on 
which Dunbarton Castle stands, is now very striking, 

' rising out of the plain to the height of 560 feet 
This rock has, at one period, been an island, the 
sea having flowed over the flat land in its neigh- 
bourhood, as far as Loch Lomond, constituting that 
lake an arm of the sea, its surface being now only 
22 feet above the high water level of the Clyde. 

r 

This interesting geological observation will appear 
satisfactory, when it is considered, that formerly^he 
western sea rose about 60 feet higher than it does 
at the present time, so that it must have covered all 
the low ground on the borders of the Clyde, which

is proved by the substratum of the soil along its 
whole course. The picturesque form of Dunbarton 
Hock , renders it the finest object in the Clyde, and 
must readily have attracted the notice of the prim- 
itive inhabitants as a fit place for the erection of a 
fort ; and it was taken up as such, at a period co- 
eval with the first occupancy of the country ; but it 
must have been an arduous undertaking, in so rude 
an age, to render the summit accessible, and to give 
it the necessary means of defence. It is now as- 
cended by different flights of steps, before the plac- 
ing of which, considerable cutting of the rock ap- 
pears to have been requisite. The view from the 

\ 

western pinnacle, which is SO feet higher than the 
eastern, is exquisitely grand, and no stranger should 
pass without enjoying it, though the access be ra- 
ther frightful. To the north, is seen the smiling 
vale of Leven , and the meanderings of the river ; 
beyond which is Loch Lomond , from whose bosom 
rises, in awful majesty, the magnificent mountain 
of Ben Lomond, surrounded by many others of in- 
ferior elevation, but of no inferior wildness. Look- 
ing up the Clyde, the prospect, as far as Glasgow , is 
exceedingly beautiful, while the view down the ri- 
ver is no less striking from its extent, and the irre- 
gular mountain outline of Argyle and Arran, that 
close in the pleasing perspective. In the guard- 
house is shown a portion of an immense sword, said 
to be that of the illustrious Wallace ; but “ dim now 
is the hue of this sword of true valour.” The town 
of Dunbarton has nothing in it to claim the notice 
of a traveller, unless it be an extensive Glasswork. 
Situated on the banks of the river Leven , it is, dur- 
ing stream tides, nearly surrounded with water, 
which flows up the river to a considerable distance. 
At a good inn here, chaises and gigs are to be 
hired.

zie ; and Leven Grove , Dixon. At the toll-bar, a 
short way on, the road separates into two branches, 
that on the right, going to Inveraray by Loss, and 
the banks of Loch Lomond ; and on the left, to the 
same place, by ■ Helensburgh and Ardencaple. We 
shall first take the former route, and proceed along 
the classic stream of the Leven, the nativity of our 
great literary countryman. Dr. Smollett, and where 
he “ tun’d his rural pipe to love.” Two miles for- 
ward, on the left, is a Tuscan obelisk erected to his 
memory, but shamefully mutilated, and hastening 
to decay. On the right, Dalquharn House, in which 
he was born. Close by, is the manufacturing vil- 
lage of Renton ; in the neighbourhood of which are 
numerous fields occupied by bleaching, mid calico 
printing. On the opposite side of the river, is Le- 
venside, Campbell ; a short way north of which, are 
the village and church of BonhiU ; about 1 mile 
further, on the right, is Cordale, Stirling ; and a 
short way on to the same side, Bonhill, Smollett. 
Near, is the village of Alexandria, also supported 
by its manufactories. . Close to it, on the left, 
Broomly, Miss Alston ; and on the right, 1 mile 
more, Leveti/ield, Todd. At a short distance, on 
the left, is the handsome porter’s lodge of Tillic- 
hewn Castle, Horrocks ; an elegant modem building 
in the castellated form, erected on an elevated site 
at some distance from the road, and surrounded 
with wood ; having all the commanding appearance 
and bold features of ancient chivalrous magnifi-

months, a steam boat, the Marion, makes daily ex- 
cursions round Loch Lomond, visiting its numerous 
islands, Rob Roys Rock and Cave, and calling at 
Tarbert and Luss, on it's return to Bollock . By 
this conveyance, strangers may go from Balloch 
and land at Tarbert , to which place their carriages 
or horses can proceed to meet them. 

Having left Balloch in the steam boat, on the 
right is- the castle of that name, Buchanan. A 
short Way, on the left, Cameron , Smollett ; and 
2 miles more, Arden , Buchanan, where there is 
an original picture of Rob Roy Macgregor , the 
only one, it is believed, in existence. Going for- 
ward, the loch gradually expands ; but the size 

of four islands, runjiing in a line, from east to 

0 

west, prevents its breadth from being seen for 
some time. On the left, is Inchmurrin , the lar- 
gest in the lake, occupied as a deer park by the 
proprietor, the Duke of Montrose ; to whom, and 
Sir James Colquhoun of Luss, the islands of the 
lakes belong. Inchcaillich, on the right, formerly 
the site of a chapel, and still used as a burying place. 
Different views of Buchanan House , the seat of 
the Duke of Montrose, are to be had, in passing 
along to the right ; and the mansions of several 
proprietors are seen in the same direction, but at 
a considerable distance. On the left, Ross Lodge 
and Rosdoe, Sir James Colquhoun. To the right 
begins to rise the stupendous mountain of Ben 

m 

Lomond , emerging, as it were, from the placid 
surface of the lake, and towering in the clouds 
to the immense altitude of 3362 feet. The isl- 
ands of this lake, of which there are more than 
30 in number, give a delightful variety to its 
extensive boundary, which, in length, is 30 miles, 
and, at its broadest part, more than 8. These 
islands . are generally adorned with wood ; and 
from their diversity of size and form, are very 
agreeable objects in every direction. On Inch - 
conachan , there are several thousand great yew-

trees, of which kind of wood, there is not, per- 
haps, another plantation in Europe. It is pro- 
bable that these were put down when archery 
formed a part of military action. Like others of 
the Highland lakes, the surface of Loch Lomond 
often displays the blue belt , which is always the 
precursor of a storm. This appearance is singu- 
lar and curious, occasioned by unequal agitation 
of the atmosphere in the vicinity of lofty moun- 
tains, which produces a corresponding inequality 
on the surface of the water, some parts being 
gently ruffled by the air, while others remain 
quiescent, and giye the appearance of long stripes 
or belts, very equably defined. From the same 
cause proceeds the waves that are said to arise in 
this loch, without wind ; for sudden squalls often 
descend from tops of mountains, when the atmos- 
phere, at some distance, is undisturbed. During 
the dreadful earthquake at Lisbon, in 1755, the 
surface of this lake was terribly agitated ; the wa- 
ter rose suddenly far above its ordinary level, and 
again quickly retiring, sunk greatly below the 
usual height ; and this unnatural motion continued 
for a considerable time. A boat was carried 40 
yards beyond the ordinary limits of the water’s 
edge. 

On the left, the Village, Church, and Ma?ise of 
Luss. The breadth of the lake now begins to di- 
minish gradually, so that its finely wooded banks 
are more perfectly to be seen. About 3 miles 
beyond Luss, is the ferry across the loch, from In- 
ver uglas on the west, to Rowardenan on the east 
side. 

Should the enterprising stranger incline to as- 
cend the top of Ben iM/nond, Rowardenan is the 
most eligible place for him to land ; for at that 
point, there is a neat comfortable inn, where guides, 
and every requisite for the journey, can be procur- 
ed. The distance from the inn to the summit of 
the mountain is computed at 6 miles ; but it is pro-

bably more, and generally occupies above 3 hours. 
The first part of the path will appear the most 
disagreeable, as it is principally over rock and 
heath. Some green ridges are, however, met 
with ; and frequently great portions of wet moss. 
Towards the summit, the track is more difficult 
and fatiguing, increasing in steepness, and over 
a very rugged or shelving surface ; but when the 
ascent is gained, the toil is amply repaid by the 
sublime and wonderful prospect which is had in 
every direction. The body of the mountain appears 
to be made up of several tremendous ridges of rock, 
rising one above another, but diminishing in a co- 
nical form, towards the top. Below, the lake ap- 
pears wonderfully lessened in size, and the islands 
as mere spots upon its surface. Looking eastward, 
is seen the river Forth, with its manifold windings, 
and numerous towns. The castle of Stirling seems 
almost beneath the mountain, while that of Edin- 
burgh, further removed, is hardly visible to the eye. 
To the south, the entire stretch of Lanarkshire, 
with the centre hill of Tinto, and its more 
remote boundary mountains of Loivtliers, and CouL- 
terfell ; and, far in the distance, the Isle of Mann 
may be discovered, if the atmosphere is clear. Turn- 
ing to the south-west, the counties of Renfrew and 
Ayr; the rock of Alisa, the islands of Bute, Arran, 
and Jura ; the coast of Ireland, Moil of Kintyre, and 
the Atlantic Ocean ; but, looking to the north, is seen 
a frightful precipice of the mountain, 2000 feet deep; 
and stretching as far as the eye can perceive, the tre- 
mendous assemblage of ruggedness that constitutes 
the Grampian chain. Nature in her wildest and 
most awful form is here to be contemplated. Moun- 
tains rise upon mountains in all the dignity of irre- 
gularity, till the eye is lost in the vastness and as- 
tonishing variety of the prospect. Valleys, lakes, 
rivers, diversify the surface of the country, to a 
great extent; and from this, all the principal 
mountains of Scotland, and no less than nine-

teen lakes, are visible ; indeed, so extensive is the 
view from the summit of Ben Lomond, that it 
is impossible for any description to give even a 
faint idea of it ; or to express the feelings of aston- 
ishment that must take possession of every one who 
is fortunate enough to reach the top in favourable 
weather. The great mass of Ben Lomond, like 
all primitive mountains, is formed of granite, 
which, in many places, is surmounted with 
quartz, micacious schistus, and red jasper; some 
specimens of which are to be found on the bor- 
ders of the lake, having been washed from the 
summit, and polished by attrition. This mountain 
furnishes much entertainment to die botanist, as 
many rare plants are to be found upon its surface. 
Ben Lomond, and the lands along the whole east- 
ern shore of the Loch, were formerly the proper- 
ty of Rob Roy Macgregor, from whom they were i 
forcibly wrested, by the then Marquis of Mon- 
trose.* 

Leaving Rowardenan, die loch is still gradually 
contracting in breadth, so diat at Rob Roy’s Rock \ 
it is hardly half a mile across. This rock, about 
a mile above Rowardenan, rises abruptly from 
the water ; the front and sides are nearly perpendi- 
cular, and about 30 feet high; the top is flat, 
and projects from another steep rock considerably 
higher. Upon this flat portion, it is said, that Rob 
Roy was in the use of letting people who offended 
him, down by a rope, as they cpuld only escape 
by leaping into the loch. Three miles farther 
on, to the left, the inn of Tarbert ; and about 2 
miles more, on the right, is Rob Roy’s Cave. The 
entrance to this cavity is rather rough, going over 
' a quantity of great stones ; and, though it is cele-

brated as affording shelter to the gallant Bruce, af- 
ter his discomfiture in Strathfillan, and afterwards 
as being the occasional retreat of Rob Roy and his 
followers. The cave of itself has no remarkable cu- 
riosity, being nothing more than a dreary subter- 
ranean cavern, in which very pressing necessity 
alone, could induce a human being to take up his 
residence.* Towards the head of Loch Lomond 
there is a small island, called Elan-a-Bhu, on which 
are the remains of an old castellet. In a vault of this 
ruin, a man of singular character has taken up his 
abode, and lives in the primitive manner of a hermit. 
He has long kept a calendar of passing events, but 
in such hieroglyphical figures as are only known 
to himself. He keeps a boat, which he occasion- 
ally uses in procuring supplies for his cell, which 
the charity of the neighbourhood affords him ; and 
he sometimes carries small articles of merchandise 
for sale.t 

Having completed the excursion through ' Loch 
Lomond, we return to the 4 mile stone from Dun- 
barton, where the BaUoch road strikes off; and pass- 
ing on, about 2 miles farther, to the left is Belre- 
liro, Mrs. Rouet ; and 1 mile more, on the right,

the lakes of Perthshire, from Rob Roy's Cave is the best and 
shortest way. He will follow a foot path, that leads in an 
easterly course, to the fort of Inver snaid, and from thence to 
Loch Kellurin . This fort was erected during the cruel policy 
that dictated the proscription of the clan Macgregor, to overawe 
and bring them to subjection. It was once set on fire by Rob 
Rot/, and afterwards taken by his nephew. 

f The Post Roy Steam Boat leaves Glasgow every morning, 
at 6 o’clock, with passengers for the Marion , plying on Loch 
Lomond , and lands them at Dunbarton , five miles from BaUoch 
from whence the Marion starts every day, at 10 o’clock. The 
Post Boy again takes them up on their return to Dun- 
barton, at 6 o’clock in the evening ; so that by this conveyance 
a stranger can leave Glasgow in the morning, visit the beautiful 
scenery of Loch Lomond , and be again at Glasgow, in 14 hours. 
A coach runs from Dunbarton to Bollock , for the convenience 
of passengers by the Post Boy, and again brings them back to 
meet the boat in the afternoon.

ver Fruin , by a modem bridge. This stream issues 
from a glen of the same name, through which the path 
formerly went to Argyleshire, and which is memo- 
rable from a sanguinary battle fought in it, betwixt 
the clan Macgregor and the Colquhouns, during 
which a barbarous massacre of 80 young men was 
perpetrated in a barn close by, the site of which is 
still pointed out From this part of the road, se- 
veral islands of the lake are seen ; and, on the right, 
the policies of Rosedoe , Sir James Colquhoun, skirt 
its borders for a considerable way. A little farther 
on, is the house of Rosedoe, and near it the ruins of 
the former mansion, both situated on a peninsular 
plain. At some distance, on the right, Camstrad- 
den, Colquhoun ; and near it, on the left, some 
slate quarries. The road now passes through a 
wood, from different openings of which the lake, 
and more of its islands come into view. Presently 
the traveller arrives at Luss inn, a house of very 
inferior accommodation, though now considered 
better than in former times. Close by is the church 
and village of Luss.* From the hill to the north- 
west of the inn, there is an extensive view of the 
lake. 

The road from Luss is close by the margin of the 
loch, and very romantic. Three miles on, pass In- 
veruglas , the ferry house to Rmvardenan. Near the 
20th mile stone, is a new cottage, Macmurrich, si- 
tuated on a gentle declivity ; and, a short way fur-

- From this place roads branch off to Helensburgh 
and Inveraray. 

Should the traveller take the road by Helens- 
burgh to Inveraray, he must return to Dunbarton, 
and proceed from thence. 

At the toll bar, a short way after leaving Dunbar- 
ton, the road strikes off to the left. About 1 mile 
forward on the high land, to the right, some trees 
point out the site of a cottage, once the occasional 
residence of the valiant Robert the Bruce ; and 
there the patriot died. His body was conveyed to 
Dunfermline , and deposited in the sepulchre of that 
abbey.t

the towns of Port Glasgow, Greenock , and their 
shipping. About 2 miles, on the right, Ardoch ,

and eventual success of the illustrious Bruce, are brought to re- 
collection, it must be matter of surprise and regret, that it is only 
now, after a lapse of near five hundred years, his eminent and un- 
equalled deeds have claimed their merited regard. Though it was 
known that the relics of that transcendent warrior were consigned 
to the earth in the abbey of Dunfermline, no attempt was made 
to ascertain the sacred depository, until last winter, when the 
precious remains were accidently discovered, in digging the 
foundation of a new church. Those relics having been satis- 
factorily identified, were re-interred ; and, it is to be hoped, that 
a suitable pile will now be reared, to point out to future genera- 
tions, the place where repose the ashes of the greatest man ever 
Scotland produced.

lofty shore of the north-west side of Loch Long. A 
short way on, to the left, is the road to Portinca- 
ple, the regular ferry to Ardintenny, at the mouth of 
Loch Goil* About 1 mile farther, the road de- 
scends a long and steep hill, to the brink of the 
loch ; close by which it continues to Arroquhar, 
about 7 miles distant. To a stranger unaccus- 
tomed to scenery of so peculiar a character, this 
spot is particularly|interesting. The loch is nar- 
row, and the mountains rising to an immense ele- 
vation on both sides, partially covered with wood, 
give a dark tinge^to the^surface of the water, and 
which, altogether, produce a genuine picture of the 
sombre features of the Highlands. 

Near the inn of Arroquhar, is the church and 
manse of the same name. This house was not 
originally intended for an inn, having been the 
seat of the chief of the clan Macfarlane ; but was 
rented and converted to an inn, by the late Duke 
of Argyle, for the accommodation of the public. 

The different roads, by which we have directed 
the steps of the tourist from Dunbarton, viz. by 
Luss and Loch Lomond, and by Helensburgh and 
Loch Long, meet at Arroquhar, from which point 
the road to Inveraray strikes off to the right, and, at 
the distance of 1 mile, crosses a bridge over the 
water of Teang, which separates the counties of 
Dunbarton and Argyle. For 2 miles more, the 
road goes along the west side of the loch, near to 
Ardgarton, Callendar, when it turns to the right,

mountains, till, at the distance of 6 miles from Ar- 
roquhar, it begins to ascend the shoulder of the 
mountain ; and for 2 miles more is a continued rise, 
of difficult ascent. The vale of Glencroe is narrow, 
the mountains that enclose it being very high. At 
the summit of this pass, there is a semicircular seat, 
with the words “ Rest and be thankful ,” cut on a 
stone that forms a part of it. This road, like many 
others throughout the Highlands, was formed by the 
military, when those regions were restored to tran- 
quillity after the commotion of 1745 ; but though 
they are, in general, well made, the lines are inju- 
diciously laid down. It has been in agitation, 
for some years, to form a new road from the 
head of Loch Long , in a direction north of the pre- 
sent one, to obviate the difficulty of passing through 
Glencroe ; but though it has been surveyed, and es- 
timates of the expence given, it is not likely soon 
to be accomplished. Leaving “ Rest and be thank- 
ful,” the road soon begins to descend ; but it is not 
so steep as Glencroe. It goes through another glen 
extremely wild and rugged,- and more dreary than 
the former. On the left, is the road to Loch Goil 
Head, which joins that to St. Catharine’s. On the 
same side. Loch Rested ; and 2 miles farther, cross 
the Butter Bridge, and enter Glen Kinglass. The 
mountains on both sides, are here likewise very 
steep and lofty ; but their surface is more smooth 
and verdant, and green to the top, from being 
pastured by sheep, which has the effect of destroy- 
ing heath, and producing grass in its place. About 
half way through this glen, the side of the moun- 
tain to the left, is broken by a great disintegration 
or avalanche, which seems to have burst from its 
brow at a distant period. Soon after, Lochfyne 
comes in sight ; and passing the old castle and mo- 
dern house of Ardkinglass, Callendar, on the left ; 
presently arrive at the inn of Caimdotv, a very 
comfortable house, where strangers meet with the 
greatest attention and civility. For foot passen-

FROM INVERARAY TO OBAN. 




BY DALMALLY, 42 m. — OR BY PORT SONACHAN, 32 

miles. 

From Inveraray , the road to Oban passes for 
some miles through the planting that surrounds the 
castle of Argyle. On both sides are seen several 
grotesque cottages, where people are stationed for 
opening- the numerous gates that lead into those ex- 
tensive demesnes; and different little villas are 
placed along this valley, which is named Glenaray , 
from the river Aray that runs in it, and which also 
gives its name to the town of Inveraray , Inver in 
the Gaelic language, signifying the mouth, or in- 
flux of a river into the sea, or a lake. 

If the traveller has not previously visited it, he 
should stop a short way beyond the third mile 
stone, to see a fine water-fall on the river, over 
which, that it may be viewed with advantage, a 
rustic bridge is thrown. For a considerable way 
the road is rather dreary, particularly at the dis- 
tance of 6 miles, when it becomes very steep, as- 
cending a bleak hill for a long space. From the 
highest part, the conical tops of die magnificent 
mountain of Cruackan are to be seen ; and, descend- 
ing the hill to the north, a beautiful and striking

scene, gradually expands to the view. The en- 
chanting lake of Loch Awe, with its wooded banks, 
is partially seen. On its opposite side, the mansion 
house of Hayfield, Macneil ; and some islands of 
the lake are observed ; and now the sublime moun- 
tain of Cruaclian is more perfectly exposed to its 
base, running abruptly into the loch. Before reach- 
ing the village of Cladich, at the foot of the hill, 
the road to Port Sonachan, a regular ferry across the 
lake, strikes off to the left. Cladich is marked, as 
a stage, in every road book ; but it does not deserve 
the name, being only a wretched hovel for the sale 
of whisky. From this to Dalmally the distance is 
about 7 miles, by a road perhaps the worst laid 
down, and most irregular in Scotland, carried 
through marshes and over hills, as if the projectors 
of it had wished to conceal the beauties of the lake. 
Had the road passed along its borders, it would have 
rendered it one of the most delightful paths in Ar- 
gyleshire. At different points of the road, how- 
ever, many advantageous views of the lake and its 
islands are to be had. On the island of Innishail 
are seen the still lofty ruins of a monastery, found- 
ed so far back as in the reign of Kenneth II. of 
Scotland. 

Within 2 miles of Dalmally, a charming view of 
the vale of Glenurchy is obtained, with the pic- 
turesque and elegant ruin of. Kilchurn castle in 
the middle of the lake. The scene is particularly 
grand and interesting, being composed of every ob- 
ject to captivate the eye of a painter, and to inspire ’ 
the soul of the poet ; for, to the influence of such 
sublime features of nature, as are here presented to 
the traveller, we are indebted for the luminous glow 
of fancy, the happy combination of images, the sen- 
timent and flowing diction of the Celtic poetry as- 
cribed to Ossian. The ancient poets of Caledonia, 
contemplating the magnificent, yet gloomy outlines 
of their country, intuitively acquired a correspond- 
ing tinge of wild melancholy, evident in most of

their compositions, such as, “ Calmar, worn down 
by the strife of years, yet clung to the bossy shield 
of his strength. 1 In the valley he reclined by the 
grey stone of memory, to invoke the spirit of his j 
father, as it floated in the aerial visions of the clouds. 
Long he lingered on the green turf of sorrow ; for 
his heart was sad, and grief raged in his soul like 
the noisy tempest of contending elements, when I 

i 

they meet on the sullen brow of the lofty Ben 
Cruachan.” 

At Dalmatty , which is 1 6 miles from Inveraray , 
there is a very comfortable inn. The house is 
prettily situated, having a fine view up Glenurchy, 
and of the mountains that bound it on the north. 
The beauty of this glen is much improved by the j 
church and its Gothic spire, lately built on an 
island of the river Urcliy that runs through this 
valley, over which there is a romantic and pic- 
turesque bridge. To the west, the head of the lake 
is seen, and the tremendous mountain of Cruachan , 
rising gradually from it to the height of 3399 feet 
On a solitary rock, commonly surrounded by the 
lake, there is another prospect of the ruins of Kil- 
churn , built in the 15th century, by a lady of the j 
house of Glenurchy, as a place of refuge from the 
turbulent state of the times. 

The road to Stirling , by Tyndrum, Lochearnheod 
and Callander , is seen to the north-east, winding 
up the hill for a considerable distance ; and that to 
Oban passes the church and manse on the left, and 
crossing the bridge, takes a long circuit round the 
head of Loch Awe. Two miles on, cross another 
bridge over the river Srae , issuing from the wild, 
black Glensrae , on the right. A short way on, the 
farm house of Corey , where the road takes a wes-

the lake towards the west, with many of its wood- 
ed islands, suddenly bursts on the eye. A short 
way on, the road begins to ascend, and passes 
along a precipitous shoulder of the mountain, at 
the height of some hundred feet above the sur- 
face of the lake. This part of the road is pecu- 
liarly romantic and wild, going through a thick 
wood ; and having a parapet wall along the brink 
of the precipice, which, to look over, appears al- 
most perpendicular. Before ascending this acclivi- 
ty., it will be advisable for the traveller to alight 
from his horse, or carriage, and examine a geologi- 
cal phenomenon of no ordinary occurrence. The 
immense lake of Loch Awe y above 30 miles long, 
has its efflux through this great chasm, which, 
however, is not its original outlet. From the 
height and steepness of the banks, it appears as if 
this passage for the water were fortuitous, occasion- 
ed by some convulsion of the earth, which has se- 
parated the hill at this place, to form the bed of the 
river. When the borders of Loch Awe , and its 
south-western extremity, are examined, it seems 
evident that, at one time, the surface was more ele- 
vated, and that the superabundant water ran off in 
that direction, into Crinan y the great moss of which, 
as formerly remarked, was then covered with the 
sea. It may also be observed, that the present 
course of the river Awe is from the side of the 
lake, which is not the natural channel, and of which 
there is hardly another instance. ; 

The traveller conversant in Scottish history, will 
recollect, that near Tyndrum , a stage 12 miles 
north-east from Dalmally y Robert the Bruce was 
obliged to retreat from an unexpected attack of su- 
perior numbers, under Alexander of Argyle. On 
a future occasion, when fortune had been more pro- 
pitious, he again explored the Highlands to retali- 
ate the injury upon the lord of Argyle. The hos- 
tile armies met on the banks of the river Awe y 
about a mile after descending from the hill just

mentioned, upon a small plain, still named Dad 
Reigh, Kingsfield , through which the present road 
passes, and where Robert defeated Argyle, and af- 
terwards marched forward, taking possession of 
his lands, together with the castle of Dunstajf- 
nage. Two miles further, the road crosses the ri- 
ver by a modem bridge, a little below which it . 
forms a beautiful cataract. Presently is seen Loch 
Etive, a long arm of the sea, and close to it, Bonaw, 
and the Lorn Smelting Furnace , the situation of i 
which is very romantic, having the river Awe on 
one side; Loch Etive in front; and behind the 
majestic Cruachan. Having crossed a small an- 
cient bridge, and passing the chinch on the right, 
arrive at the inn of Taynuilt. 

In order to gratify a taste for picturesque scen- 
ery, the traveller should walk from the inn to the 
mouth of the Awe, below the Furnace , where there 
is a ferry ; and then cross and ascend the hill above 
the ferry-house, where are the remains of an an- 
cient alarm post, from which he will have the most 
charming perspective of mountain grandeur to be 
seen in Great Britain, with the stretch of Loch 
Etive, beautifully ornamented with wood, altogether ' 
forming a picture rarely to be met with. 

If the stranger inclines to explore the moun- 
tain of Cruachan, and climb to its summit, he 
can readily procure a guide to accompany him. 
The task will no doubt be arduous ; but the very 
extensive prospect which it commands, will suffi- 
ciently compensate the toil. For a considerable 
part of the way, the ascent is gradual, and does not 
become very steep till towards the highest pinnacle, 
from which a most astonishing view is obtained. 
To the west is beheld the interminable expanse of 
the Atlantic Ocean, studded with the numerous He- 
bride islands that rise from its surface, from Islav 

m 

Rs far as the mountains of Skye. To the south 
are visible the peninsula of Kintyre, Arran, Avr 
Galloway, and Ireland ; and to the east, the mul-

titude of tremendous mountains that constitute the 
Grampian chain ; stretching north from which, and 
vying with them in multiplicity and ruggedness, 
are the mighty altitudes of the counties of Argyle 
and Inverness. The many arms of the sea that indent 
the coast, and fresh water lakes of the interior, are 
distinctly seen for a great distance ; in particular the 
beautiful Loch Awe is exposed to the eye for its 
whole length; and though little known, even to 
the natives of Argyleshire, from the want of roads 
along its banks, is one of the finest sheets of water 
in Britain, not destitute of picturesque effect and 
romantic grandeur, especially at its south western 
extremity, where some of its islands and borders 
are adorned with ivy-clad ruins of castles, erect- 
ed at a far distant period, when the lords of 
Loch Awe commanded a daring train of vassals, 
and gave laws to the extensive districts of Ar- 
gyle, Inverness, and Ross. 

For rather more than 4 miles from Taynuilt, 
the road is hilly and tedious. Now and then is 
had a glimpse of Loch Etive, on the north bank 
of which is the ruin of Ardchattan Priory, one of 
the most early religious establishments in Scot- 
land, probably not more modern than the build- 
ings of Iona. Five miles from Taynuilt the l-oad 
descends to the loch side, and proceeds close to 
the shore for 4 miles more. In going along this 
level piece of road, a very extensive and fascinat- 
ing landscape is in view. In the distance are the 
black mountains of Mull and Morvern, towering to 
the sky ; with the green island of Lismore rising 
in more gentle elevation above the horizon. On 
the right is the point of Ardnucknage, with its 
obelisk; and, on the left, the hoary castle of 
Dunstaffnage, a venerable and interesting object, 
having been the residence of the early Caledo- 
nian monarchs. The traveller soon passes the fer- 
ry of Conal, from whence is the public road to 
•Fort William, by the ferries of Shian and Ballahu-

lish. At Conal, during flood and ebb water, the 
stream is exceedingly rapid, though perfectly safe. 
The road now leaves the shore, and, passing over a 
bleak dreary muir for four miles, descends towards 
the village of Oban ; before entering which the xoad i 
proceeds along the base of some romantic rocks 
of brecchia. To the left are seen, Soroba, Mac- 
dougall ; and the road which leads to the south- 
ern parts of the county, — Easdale, Craignish, Cri- \ 
nan, Lochgilphead, and Kintyre. Oban has no- 
thing in it worthy of observation ; but, in point of 
situation, it is not destitute of natural embellish- 
ment nor of geological interest. In its vicinity are 

i 

considerable beds of brecchia, and its transition 
with different rocks, with several examples of its 
alternation with sandstone and schistose formation. 

From this line of road a deviation may be made, 
which shortens the distance from Inverary to Oban 
nearly 10 miles ; but it has not the interesting gran- 
deur of what has just been described. A short 
way before reaching the miserable stage of Cladich , 
a road goes off to the left, for Port Sonachan, 
distant 3 miles ; but it is hilly and very bad. 
From the higher parts of it, however, there is a 
good view of the upper portion of Loch Awe, with 
the great mountains that nearly encircle it. Des- 
cending the hill, close to the road, pass Ardvreck - 
nisli } now named Rock Hill , by the present pro- 
prietor. Near this is Port Sonachan , an establish- 
ed ferry, where carriages and horses can safely 
cross the lake. The accommodations of the inn, or 
ferry-house, at this place, are of the very worst des- 
cription ; but this is not a solitary reflection, as it is 
also applicable to almost all the ferry-houses in the 
Highlands, which is a serious consideration to tra- 
vellers, from the indispensable number of ferries in 
a country so much intersected by arms of the sea, 
and fresh water lakes. The county regulations 
oblige the proprietors to keep sufficient boats for 
the accommodation of passengers j and it is much

to be regretted that more attention is not given to 
have comfortable houses at those ferries, where a 
stranger could be well treated should he have occa- 
sion to wait for favourable weather ; or should he 
wish to explore any thing remarkable in their vi- 
cinity. 

Having crossed the ferry of Port Sonachan , 
which is about a mile in breadth, a short way on, 
pass the manse of Kilchrenan, on the left, and a lit- 
tle further, the church and village of that name. 
For 7 miles more the road is very irregular, though 
agreeable ; passing through a romantic valley, along 
the banks of a river, adorned with wood, and at the 
distance of a mile from the inn of Taynuiit , it joins 
the road described in the preceding part of this 
section.

FROM DUNBARTON BY DRYMEN TO 

GLASGOW. 


TO DRYMEN, 12 ^ Dl.— -GLASGOW, 18 ID. 

If the stranger does not incline to explore the 
mountainous regions of the western Highlands, there 
is another route by which he can return to Glasgow, 
and have a distant view of Loch Lomond , and several 
mountains of the Grampian range. That road is 
delineated in the 7th plate. It strikes off at the east 
end of Dunbarton , in a* northerly direction, and 
proceeds along the Leven . The course of this ad- 
mirable river, winding through many fertile plains ; 
the numerous manufactories along its borders, 
which avail themselves of its pure and ample 
stream ; the various mansions of opulence in its vi- 
cinity, adorned with thriving woods ; together with 
the bustle of a very considerable population, give 
a degree of life and cheerfulness to the banks of the 
river Leven , no where else *to be met with in so 
small a space of country. 

Two miles forward, pass Levenside , Campbell, 
pleasantly situated on a wide lawn, and surround- 
ed with trees ; half a mile more, Kirkland Cotta ge? 
Pearston ; and half a mile further, the church and '

village of Bonhill, in the cemetery of which is a very 
large ash tree. On the opposite side of the river 
are seen, in succession, Smollet’s monument; the 
villages of Renton and Alexandria, the houses of 
Cordale, Bonhillplace, Broomly, and Tillicheron Cas- 
tle , as stated in a preceding section. Three miles 
from Bonhill village, pass the road to the ferry of 
Balloch, which crosses the river near its efflux from 
Loch Lomond, and from whence a steam boat plies 
daily through the lake. On the left Balloch Castle, 
Buchanan ; and, at some distance, on a considerable 
elevation of Nockone hill, is the ruin of Bertruick 
Castle. A little further on, to the right, Waters- 
toun, Alston; and, at a short distance, Lochend, 
Pearston. From different parts of the road, views 
of Ben Lomond and the loch, with several of its 
islands, are to be obtained. On the left, 3 miles 
more, Ross, Buchanan ; and 1 mile further, the re- 
mains of Kilmaronock Castle, at one time an exten- 
sive and magnificent edifice. On the north side of 
the river Endrick, a beautiful serpentine stream, is 
seen Buchanan, the mansion of the Duke of Mon- 
trose, surrounded with extensive lawns and planta- 
tions. This place was originally the seat of the 
chiefs of the Buchanans, who occupied it as such 
for more than 700 years ; but, like many other 
properties in Scotland, was alienated from the 
owners by means not now necessary to scru- 
tinize. 

Not far from the road, the traveller passes the 
church of Kilmaronock ; and, 2 miles more, crosses 
the water of Endrick, by Drymen bridge, and soon 
enters the village of Drymen, where there is an excel- 
lent inn. From this the roads to Stirling, Aberj* oil, and 
the Trosachs, and the north side of Loch Lomond, 
go off ; but that to Glasgow returns by the bridge, 
and takes a southerly course. On the left, pass 
Spittal, Hamilton, soon after, Endrick Bank, Camp- 
bell ; and opposite, on the right, Fennich, Leckie. 
The road now begins to be hilly, with several steep

pulls. Craglechey on the left. At a short distance 
is the house of Killearn, Blackburn ; and village of 
that name, in which is situated an elegant obelisk, 

10 3 feet high, erected to the memory of George 
Buchanan, the Scottish historian and poet. The 
road passes, for several miles, through a dreary 
muir called Stockie, where no human habitation is 
to be seen for several miles. Half way across this 
muir, about 2 miles to the right of the road, is a 
curious formation of basaltic rock. The course of 
the river Endrick displays several falls, one of 
which is above 90 feet high. At the Spout of Bah- 
lagan, an interesting section of the hill is presented, 
and discovers 192 alternate strata of earth and lime- 
stone. 

Emerging from this muir, but still in situations 
wild and exposed, are seen on the right, Aucheneen, 
Wilson ; and, on the left, Carbeth, Guthrie. On the 
hill side, and after descending, Mugdock Castle ruins, 
and Craigton, Lord Succoth, on the left. One 
mile more, Balvie, Glassford, and further off, Clober, 
Stirling. Further on. Mains, Douglas ; and Burn~ 
brae, Douglas. Numerous houses and farm steads 
on both sides the road. Cross the Kelvin. On the j 
right Carscube, Sir Ilay Campbell; and, on the 
left, KiUermont, Lord Register. . Two miles more, 
on the left, the Kelvin Aqueduct Bridge, a stupen- 
dous structure, romantically situated. Along which 
the Forth and Clyde Canal crosses that river. This 
aqueduct is formed of four magnificent stone arches, 
which conduct the water across a ravine of 400 feet 
in breadth, and more than 80 in depth ; and is well 
worthy the minute inspection of the tourist. 

For 3 miles more pass several villas, the northern 
suburbs of Glasgow, and enter that city.

IV. 


EXCURSION TO LOCH KETTURIN AND THE 

TROSACHS. 




It was not our intention, on the present occa- 
sion, to have included any sketches of the scenery 

% 

of Loch Ketturin and the Trosachs ; but as most 
Scottish tourists visit those places, they may be 
gratified with the concise description given in this 
section. 

There are different routes by which a traveller 
can explore the romantic wonders of the Trosachs, 
but the most approved is that from the village of 
Callander, 1 6 miles west of Stirling, and 37^ north 
of Glasgow, from whence there is a carriage road 
to Loch Ketturin. Callander is immediately upon 
the confines of the Highlands, and is beautifully 
situated upon the banks of the river Teitk. Due 
west, at a short distance, is the stupendous moun- 
tain of Ben Ledi, and to the north is the Craig, a 
long ridge of high rocks ; and it is on all sides sur- 
rounded with wood. Close to it are the remains of 
a Roman camp ; this situation being the extremity 
of the conquests of that people, who were prevent- 
ed from further progress in this direction, by what 
appeared to them, the inaccessible barriers of the 
mountains that rise immediately, and in an abrupt 
manner, west of this place. Indeed, in the present 
day, the Pass of Lcny could, with a few men, be 
defended against a great army. It is very beauti- 


112 


BRIDGE OE KELTY, BEN LEDI. 


ful and wild, and being only about 2 miles beyond 
Callander , is an object well worth a visit. In 
another direction, north-east from the village, a sin- 
gular romantic bridge across the river Kelly, should 
be seen. It crosses a dark and rugged chasm of 
100 feet deep, by two projecting rocks, surround- 
ed and overhung by finely variegated copse-wood. 
The path to it winds along the sides of shelving 
rocks that hang overhead, while the roaring of a 
cataract, partly tossed over a broken precipice, falls, 
at last, in one sheet, into a ravine far below. The 
gloom and perfect horror of this place is, in general, 
appalling to the strongest nerves ; for a more seem- 
ingly hazardous place is hardly to be conceived. 
Near this is seen a delightful view of the whole vale 
of Monteith , by Down and Stirling Castles , which 
form charming objects in the picture. 

The journey to the Trosachs from Callander , 
generally occupies a day, so that it is necessary to 
provide refreshments for it, which are procured at 
an excellent inn at the west end of the village. The 
road goes off to the west, and about 3 miles farther, 
is the lake Venachoir ; in approaching which, the 
scenery begins to assume a new and interesting cha- 
racter. The margin of the lake, is adorned with 
wood, and has many points of land, which beautify 
the scenery. On the right, all along, Ben Ledi is seen, 
with its green summit, from which there is a very ex- 
tensive prospect, from the borders of England to In- 
verness-shire, and along the rivers and friths of the 
Forth and Clyde. Many druidical reliquesare to be 
seen upon and along the base of Ben Ledi , from the 
sacred point of view in which it was held during the 
days of Paganism in Scotland. 

At some distance, is the bridge of Tusk , encom- 
passed with soft and beautiful scenery ; and, a lit- 
tle further. Loch Achray , which is very romantic, 
being closely wooded from the brink of the w f ater, 
to the top of the almost perpendicular hills that sur- 
round it. Near this is a road to Glenfinglas , an

cient deer forest, formerly belonging to the Scottish 
monarchs. 

At the first point which runs into Loch Achray, is 
a distant glimpse of the Trosachs, scattered in wild 
confusion across the western extremity of the lake. 
Passing Loch Achray, the traveller enters the first 
opening of the Trosachs, when to his wondering 
eye is presented a scene of the utmost magnificence, 
far surpassing description. But at the second head- 
land, a short way on, the prospect becomes more 
perfect, extending from Benvenue on the left, to 
Benean on the right. The fore ground is composed 
of a small lake, fringed with wood, with the soften- 
ing intermixture of meadows and corn fields ; while 
the back ground is formed of rugged mountains, 
and dislocated cliffs, in such diversity of figures, 
that, with the elegant natural disposition and pic- 
turesque effect of the woods, dispersed in every 
possible point of view, a coup d’ceil is exhibited, to 
which there is probably no parallel ; indeed every 
step discloses new objects of admiration. Upon en- 
tering a narrow and dark defile, the further extre- 
mity of which opens upon Loch Ketturin, there is a 
fine echo produced from the concave rocks on the 
left, which repeats several syllables in a very dis- 
tinct manner. 

The stranger, when he arrives on the banks of 
Loch Ketturin, will instantly be astonished with the 
magnificent landscape which is exposed before him 
Nature in her wildest yet most romantic aspect, 
seems as if she had here collected her every pro- 
duction to render the scenery sublime. Mountains 
and rocks in wild confusion, bpt adorned with trees 
and shrubs of every description growing around, 
and even to the tops of the highest altitudes, give a 
wonderful variety of the grand and picturesque to 
the view. 

“ Crags, knolls, and moulds, confusedly hurl’d, 

The fragments of an early world ; 

And mountains, that like giants stand, 

To centinel enchanted land,” 


« t 



114 


LOCH KETTURIN 


~ is a very fine and natural description of this asti 
nishing scene. 

Before the present road was formed, the only pas 
to this fairy land was down a steep crag, by the as 
sistance of a rope made of osier or birch twigs, ant 
fastened to the root of a tree ; a task both difficul' 
and perilous. I 

Numerous situations, many of them elevated 
some hundred feet above the lake, are to be ob- 
tained for viewing its beauties, all of which are so 
obvious that the traveller can readily discover them. 

Should a boat be procured at the west end of the 
lake, the stranger can visit the islands, and also 
Corrie-nan- Ureskan, the Den of the Goblin ; and, at 
the same time, have a charming view of the sur- 
rounding mountains. The Goblin’s Den is a high 
rock, overshadowed with wood, at the base of which 
huge flags of stones are collected, forming caverns 
of various dimensions, formerly the receptacles of 
banditti. I 

From the summit of a hill to the west, where a 

♦ 

hut has been erected, the most extensive pros- 
pect of the lake, the Trosachs, and distant moun- 
tains of Arroquhar is had. 

The scenery, on every side, is enriched by' 
a multiplicity of sublime objects, calculated to 
captivate the eye, and astonish the mind. So 
many lofty mountains, furrowed by descending 
streams, bare crags, and deep woods of • beau- 
tiful variegation, form so continually a changing 
succession of grandeur, as must fascinate every per- 
son of taste. 

Besides the road from Callander, there are others 
which lead to this enchanting region, from Glasgow, 
Drymen, and Aberfoil, and from Bob Roy’s Cave, 
on the banks of Loch Lomond, or from Ben Lo- 
mond ; where the traveller may reverse the track we 
. have briefly endeavoured to lay before him.
