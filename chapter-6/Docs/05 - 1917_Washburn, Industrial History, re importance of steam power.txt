The introduction of steam-power, the opening of the Blackstone Canal and the railroads, have made it possible for a large manufacturing city to grow where otherwise no considerable progress could have been made; for had it been necessary to depend altogether upon water-power, few large factories could have been located upon the small streams which constitute the headwaters of the Blackstone. These streams, nevertheless, have played a most important part, affording means for starting manufactories which have since so largely developed in size and variety; while the increased demand for power has been met by the introduction of steam-engines, through whose medium the waters which formerly were directly applied to the water-wheels, and whose capacity was consequently limited, are now equal to any demands which may be made upon them. For these reasons the water privileges and streams deserve prominent mention in any account of the manufacturing industries of Worcester.
