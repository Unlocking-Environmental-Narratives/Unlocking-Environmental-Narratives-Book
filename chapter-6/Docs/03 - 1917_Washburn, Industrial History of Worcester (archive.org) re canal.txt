The desire for communication between the seaboard and Worcester appears to have been felt previous to March, 1796, when some persons formed an association at Providence for making a canal to Worcester, and they were at that time invited to a conference in Worcester at the tavern of Ephraim Mower. Later on, no doubt as a result of this meeting, a prospectus appeared setting forth the purpose of the Canal Company, which was to issue four thousand shares of stock at one hundred dollars each, which it was estimated would cover the cost of building the canal. Subscriptions were solicited in Worcester; William Paine (at Dr. Lincoln's store), Joseph Allen (at his office), Isaiah Thomas, Thomas Payson, Daniel Waldo, Jr., and Samuel Chandler were appointed to receive them. In October, 1796, a number of individuals petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation for the purpose of cutting a canal from Great Pond in Worcester to Boston, but nothing was done at this time either with the Blackstone Canal or with the proposed canal to Boston. In 1822 surveys were made for the Blackstone Canal, which was afterwards put into successful operation, as appears later in the narrative.
